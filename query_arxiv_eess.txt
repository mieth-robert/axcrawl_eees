Title: Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment Protocol for Semantic Communication in AI Agent Networks
Authors: Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence (AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication (SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless, SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP), which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources compared to conventional approaches.

Title: From Weak Labels to Strong Results: Utilizing 5,000 Hours of Noisy Classroom Transcripts with Minimal Accurate Data
Authors: Ahmed Adel Attia, Dorottya Demszky, Jing Liu, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Recent progress in speech recognition has relied on models trained on vast amounts of labeled data. However, classroom Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) faces the real-world challenge of abundant weak transcripts paired with only a small amount of accurate, gold-standard data. In such low-resource settings, high transcription costs make re-transcription impractical. To address this, we ask: what is the best approach when abundant inexpensive weak transcripts coexist with limited gold-standard data, as is the case for classroom speech data? We propose Weakly Supervised Pretraining (WSP), a two-step process where models are first pretrained on weak transcripts in a supervised manner, and then fine-tuned on accurate data. Our results, based on both synthetic and real weak transcripts, show that WSP outperforms alternative methods, establishing it as an effective training methodology for low-resource ASR in real-world scenarios.

Title: Voicing Personas: Rewriting Persona Descriptions into Style Prompts for Controllable Text-to-Speech
Authors: Yejin Lee, Jaehoon Kang, Kyuhong Shim
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework to control voice style in prompt-based, controllable text-to-speech systems by leveraging textual personas as voice style prompts. We present two persona rewriting strategies to transform generic persona descriptions into speech-oriented prompts, enabling fine-grained manipulation of prosodic attributes such as pitch, emotion, and speaking rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods enhance the naturalness, clarity, and consistency of synthesized speech. Finally, we analyze implicit social biases introduced by LLM-based rewriting, with a focus on gender. We underscore voice style as a crucial factor for persona-driven AI dialogue systems.

Title: TAGS: 3D Tumor-Adaptive Guidance for SAM
Authors: Sirui Li, Linkai Peng, Zheyuan Zhang, Gorkem Durak, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP and SAM have recently shown great promise in image segmentation tasks, yet their adaptation to 3D medical imaging-particularly for pathology detection and segmentation-remains underexplored. A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation tasks.

Title: Assessing the generalization performance of SAM for ureteroscopy scene understanding
Authors: Martin Villagrana, Francisco Lopez-Tiro, Clement Larose, Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz, Christian Daul
Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.

Title: IAE Optimized PID Tuning via Second Order Step Response Target Matching
Authors: Senol Gulgonul
Abstract: This paper presents SOSTIAE (Second-Order System Target IAE), a novel PID tuning method that combines IAE minimization with explicit transient response shaping for practical control applications. The algorithm generates optimal PID parameters by matching the closed-loop response to a target second-order system with user-defined settling time (T_s) and percent overshoot (PO), while maintaining the conventional IAE performance metric. Comparative evaluations on first to third-order systems demonstrate that SOSTIAE consistently outperforms MATLAB's proprietary pidtune() function, achieving 47-67% lower overshoot and up to 26% better IAE performance for higher-order plants. The constrained optimization framework ensures physically realizable controllers by enforcing non-negative PID gains and stability criteria, addressing known limitations of unconstrained IAE methods. Results indicate that SOSTIAE provides engineers with a systematic alternative for PID tuning when transient specifications and practical implementation constraints are critical.

Authors: Tamas G. Molnar
Abstract: Collision-free motion is a fundamental requirement for many autonomous systems. This paper develops a safety-critical control approach for the collision-free navigation of polytope-shaped agents in polytope-shaped environments. A systematic method is proposed to generate control barrier function candidates in closed form that lead to controllers with formal safety guarantees. The proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation, with obstacle avoidance examples in 2D and 3D, including dynamically changing environments.

Title: Control of Renewable Energy Communities using AI and Real-World Data
Authors: Tiago Fonseca, Clarisse Sousa, Ricardo Ven√¢ncio, Pedro Pires, Ricardo Severino, Paulo Rodrigues, Pedro Paiva, Luis Lino Ferreira
Abstract: The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms, have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5% decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.

Title: Low-Rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Backbones for Energy-Efficient Image Coding for Machine
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Zhihao Duan, Yuning Huang, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) focuses on optimizing image compression for AI-driven analysis rather than human perception. Existing ICM frameworks often rely on separate codecs for specific tasks, leading to significant storage requirements, training overhead, and computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient framework that leverages pre-trained vision backbones to extract robust and versatile latent representations suitable for multiple tasks. We introduce a task-specific low-rank adaptation mechanism, which refines the pre-trained features to be both compressible and tailored to downstream applications. This design minimizes trainable parameters and reduces energy costs for multi-task scenarios. By jointly optimizing task performance and entropy minimization, our method enables efficient adaptation to diverse tasks and datasets without full fine-tuning, achieving high coding efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional codecs and pre-processors, offering an energy-efficient and effective solution for ICM applications. The code and the supplementary materials will be available at: this https URL.

Title: State of health prediction of lithium-ion batteries for driving conditions based on full parameter domain sparrow search algorithm and dual-module bidirectional gated recurrent unit
Authors: Jie Wen, Chenyu Jia, Guangshu Xia
Abstract: Aiming at the state of health (SOH) prediction of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) for electric vehicles (EVs), this paper proposes a fusion model of a dual-module bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with full parameter domain optimization. With the help of Spearman correlation analysis and ablation experiments, the indirect health indicator (HI) that can characterize the battery degradation is extracted first based on the incremental capacity (IC) curves of the Oxford battery dataset, which simulates the driving conditions. On this basis, the filtered one-dimensional HI is inputted into the dual-module BiGRU for learning the pre- and post-textual information of the input sequence and extracting the sequence features. In order to combine the different hyperparameters in the dual-module BiGRU, SSA is used to optimize the hyperparameters in the full parameter domain. The proposed SSA-BiGRU model combines the advantages and structures of SSA and BiGRU to achieve the highly accurate SOH prediction of LiBs. Studies based on the Oxford battery dataset have shown that the SSA-BiGRU model has higher accuracy, better robustness and generalization ability. Moreover, the proposed SSA-BiGRU model is tested on a real road-driven EV charging dataset and accurate SOH prediction are obtained.

Title: A Dynamic Phasor Framework for Analysis of Grid-Forming Converter Connected to Series-Compensated Line
Authors: Fiaz Hossain, Nilanjan Ray Chaudhuri
Abstract: A dynamic phasor (DP) framework for time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of grid-forming converters (GFCs) connected to series-compensated transmission lines is proposed. The proposed framework can capture the behavior of GFCs subjected to unbalanced short circuit faults in presence of different current limiting strategies. Moreover, the linearizability and time invariance of this framework allows us to perform eigen decomposition, which is a powerful tool for root-cause analysis and control design. We show that a certain degree of series compensation may result in poorly-damped oscillations in presence of the grid-forming converter. A participation factor analysis using the DP model reveals that the point of interconnection voltage angle is dominant in this mode. Eigenvalue sensitivity analysis of controller parameters shows that reducing the power-frequency droop coefficient is most effective in stabilizing the poorly-damped mode. Detailed validation with electromagnetic transient model demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed framework.

Title: Speechless: Speech Instruction Training Without Speech for Low Resource Languages
Authors: Alan Dao (Gia Tuan Dao), Dinh Bach Vu, Huy Hoang Ha, Tuan Le Duc Anh, Shreyas Gopal, Yue Heng Yeo, Warren Keng Hoong Low, Eng Siong Chng, Jia Qi Yip
Abstract: The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM) has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems. Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to building voice assistant for low-resource languages.

Title: SUFFICIENT: A scan-specific unsupervised deep learning framework for high-resolution 3D isotropic fetal brain MRI reconstruction
Authors: Jiangjie Wu, Lixuan Chen, Zhenghao Li, Xin Li, Saban Ozturk, Lihui Wang, Rongpin Wang, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang
Abstract: High-quality 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis. Reliable slice-to-volume registration (SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods are essential. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing SVR and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.

Title: Anatomy-Guided Multitask Learning for MRI-Based Classification of Placenta Accreta Spectrum and its Subtypes
Authors: Hai Jiang, Qiongting Liu, Yuanpin Zhou, Jiawei Pan, Ting Song, Yao Lu
Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively. Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Autonomous Circular Drift Control for 4WD-4WS Vehicles Without Precomputed Drifting Equilibrium
Authors: Yue Xiao, Yi He, Yaqing Zhang, Xin Lin, Ming Zhang
Abstract: Under extreme conditions, autonomous drifting enables vehicles to follow predefined paths at large slip angles, significantly enhancing the control system's capability to handle hazardous scenarios. Four-wheel-drive and four-wheel-steering (4WD-4WS) vehicles, which have been extensively studied, offer superior path-following precision and enhanced maneuverability under challenging driving conditions. In this paper, a hierarchical drifting controller is proposed for 4WD-4WS vehicles to track both path and velocity without relying on precomputed drifting equilibrium. The controller is structured into two layers: a trajectory tracking layer and an actuator regulation layer. The first layer generates the desired tire forces in the vehicle body frame, while the second layer converts these desired tire forces into steering angle commands and torque commands for the front and rear motors. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller are validated through simulation.

Title: Interference Modulation: A Novel Technique for Low-Rate and Power Efficient Multiple Access
Authors: M. Yaser Yagan, Ali E. Pusane, Ali Gorcin, Ibrahim Hokelek
Abstract: The majority of spatial signal processing techniques focus on increasing the total system capacity and providing high data rates for intended user(s). Unlike the existing studies, this paper introduces a novel interference modulation method that exploits the correlation between wireless channels to enable low-data-rate transmission towards additional users with a minimal power allocation. The proposed method changes the interference power at specific channels to modulate a low-rate on-off keying signal. This is achieved by appropriately setting the radiation pattern of front-end components of a transmitter, i.e., analog beamforming weights or metasurface configuration. The paper investigates theoretical performance limits and analyzes the efficiency in terms of sum rate. Bit error rate simulation results are closely matched with theoretical findings. The initial findings indicate that the proposed technique can be instrumental in providing reduced capability communication using minimal power consumption in 6G networks.

Title: DECT-based Space-Squeeze Method for Multi-Class Classification of Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer
Authors: Hai Jiang, Chushan Zheng, Jiawei Pan, Yuanpin Zhou, Qiongting Liu, Xiang Zhang, Jun Shen, Yao Lu
Abstract: Background: Accurate assessment of metastatic burden in axillary lymph nodes is crucial for guiding breast cancer treatment decisions, yet conventional imaging modalities struggle to differentiate metastatic burden levels and capture comprehensive lymph node characteristics. This study leverages dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to exploit spectral-spatial information for improved multi-class classification. Purpose: To develop a noninvasive DECT-based model classifying sentinel lymph nodes into three categories: no metastasis ($N_0$), low metastatic burden ($N_{+(1-2)}$), and heavy metastatic burden ($N_{+(\geq3)}$), thereby aiding therapeutic planning. Methods: We propose a novel space-squeeze method combining two innovations: (1) a channel-wise attention mechanism to compress and recalibrate spectral-spatial features across 11 energy levels, and (2) virtual class injection to sharpen inter-class boundaries and compact intra-class variations in the representation space. Results: Evaluated on 227 biopsy-confirmed cases, our method achieved an average test AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) across three cross-validation folds, outperforming established CNNs (VGG, ResNet, etc). The channel-wise attention and virtual class components individually improved AUC by 5.01% and 5.87%, respectively, demonstrating complementary benefits. Conclusions: The proposed framework enhances diagnostic AUC by effectively integrating DECT's spectral-spatial data and mitigating class ambiguity, offering a promising tool for noninvasive metastatic burden assessment in clinical practice.

Title: GPS-Aided Deep Learning for Beam Prediction and Tracking in UAV mmWave Communication
Authors: Vendi Ardianto Nugroho, Byung Moo Lee
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables high data rates for cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, a robust beam management remains challenging due to significant path loss and the dynamic mobility of UAVs, which can destabilize the UAV-base station (BS) link. This research presents a GPS-aided deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously predicts current and future optimal beams for UAV mmWave communications, maintaining a Top-1 prediction accuracy exceeding 70% and an average power loss below 0.6 dB across all prediction steps. These outcomes stem from a proposed data set splitting method ensuring balanced label distribution, paired with a GPS preprocessing technique that extracts key positional features, and a DL architecture that maps sequential position data to beam index predictions. The model reduces overhead by approximately 93% (requiring the training of 2 ~ 3 beams instead of 32 beams) with 95% beam prediction accuracy guarantees, and ensures 94% to 96% of predictions exhibit mean power loss not exceeding 1 dB.

Title: FreqU-FNet: Frequency-Aware U-Net for Imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Ruiqi Xing
Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces persistent challenges due to severe class imbalance and the frequency-specific distribution of anatomical structures. Most conventional CNN-based methods operate in the spatial domain and struggle to capture minority class signals, often affected by frequency aliasing and limited spectral selectivity. Transformer-based models, while powerful in modeling global dependencies, tend to overlook critical local details necessary for fine-grained segmentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreqU-FNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture operating in the frequency domain. Our framework incorporates a Frequency Encoder that leverages Low-Pass Frequency Convolution and Daubechies wavelet-based downsampling to extract multi-scale spectral features. To reconstruct fine spatial details, we introduce a Spatial Learnable Decoder (SLD) equipped with an adaptive multi-branch upsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a frequency-aware loss (FAL) function to enhance minority class learning. Extensive experiments on multiple medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that FreqU-FNet consistently outperforms both CNN and Transformer baselines, particularly in handling under-represented classes, by effectively exploiting discriminative frequency bands.

Title: Distance Estimation in Outdoor Driving Environments Using Phase-only Correlation Method with Event Cameras
Authors: Masataka Kobayashi (1), Shintaro Shiba (2), Quan Kong (2), Norimasa Kobori (2), Tsukasa Shimizu (3), Shan Lu (1), Takaya Yamazato (1) ((1) School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan, (2) Woven by Toyota, Inc., Tokyo, Japan, (3) Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota, Japan)
Abstract: With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable autonomous driving systems. Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible light. In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters. Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.

Title: Private kNN-VC: Interpretable Anonymization of Converted Speech
Authors: Carlos Franzreb, Arnab Das, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian M√∂ller
Abstract: Speaker anonymization seeks to conceal a speaker's identity while preserving the utility of their speech. The achieved privacy is commonly evaluated with a speaker recognition model trained on anonymized speech. Although this represents a strong attack, it is unclear which aspects of speech are exploited to identify the speakers. Our research sets out to unveil these aspects. It starts with kNN-VC, a powerful voice conversion model that performs poorly as an anonymization system, presumably because of prosody leakage. To test this hypothesis, we extend kNN-VC with two interpretable components that anonymize the duration and variation of phones. These components increase privacy significantly, proving that the studied prosodic factors encode speaker identity and are exploited by the privacy attack. Additionally, we show that changes in the target selection algorithm considerably influence the outcome of the privacy attack.

Title: A Unified Multi-Scale Attention-Based Network for Automatic 3D Segmentation of Lung Parenchyma & Nodules In Thoracic CT Images
Authors: Muhammad Abdullah, Furqan Shaukat
Abstract: Lung cancer has been one of the major threats across the world with the highest mortalities. Computer-aided detection (CAD) can help in early detection and thus can help increase the survival rate. Accurate lung parenchyma segmentation (to include the juxta-pleural nodules) and lung nodule segmentation, the primary symptom of lung cancer, play a crucial role in the overall accuracy of the Lung CAD pipeline. Lung nodule segmentation is quite challenging because of the diverse nodule types and other inhibit structures present within the lung lobes. Traditional machine/deep learning methods suffer from generalization and robustness. Recent Vision Language Models/Foundation Models perform well on the anatomical level, but they suffer on fine-grained segmentation tasks, and their semi-automatic nature limits their effectiveness in real-time clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method for accurate 3D segmentation of lung parenchyma and lung nodules. The proposed architecture is an attention-based network with residual blocks at each encoder-decoder state. Max pooling is replaced by strided convolutions at the encoder, and trilinear interpolation is replaced by transposed convolutions at the decoder to maximize the number of learnable parameters. Dilated convolutions at each encoder-decoder stage allow the model to capture the larger context without increasing computational costs. The proposed method has been evaluated extensively on one of the largest publicly available datasets, namely LUNA16, and is compared with recent notable work in the domain using standard performance metrics like Dice score, IOU, etc. It can be seen from the results that the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Towards Prospective Medical Image Reconstruction via Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport
Authors: Taoran Zheng, Xing Li, Yan Yang, Xiang Gu, Zongben Xu, Jian Sun
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.

Title: Audio-to-Audio Emotion Conversion With Pitch And Duration Style Transfer
Authors: Soumya Dutta, Avni Jain, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: Given a pair of source and reference speech recordings, audio-to-audio (A2A) style transfer involves the generation of an output speech that mimics the style characteristics of the reference while preserving the content and speaker attributes of the source. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, termed as A2A Zero-shot Emotion Style Transfer (A2A-ZEST), that enables the transfer of reference emotional attributes to the source while retaining its speaker and speech contents. The A2A-ZEST framework consists of an analysis-synthesis pipeline, where the analysis module decomposes speech into semantic tokens, speaker representations, and emotion embeddings. Using these representations, a pitch contour estimator and a duration predictor are learned. Further, a synthesis module is designed to generate speech based on the input representations and the derived factors. This entire paradigm of analysis-synthesis is trained purely in a self-supervised manner with an auto-encoding loss. For A2A emotion style transfer, the emotion embedding extracted from the reference speech along with the rest of the representations from the source speech are used in the synthesis module to generate the style translated speech. In our experiments, we evaluate the converted speech on content/speaker preservation (w.r.t. source) as well as on the effectiveness of the emotion style transfer (w.r.t. reference). The proposal, A2A-ZEST, is shown to improve over other prior works on these evaluations, thereby enabling style transfer without any parallel training data. We also illustrate the application of the proposed work for data augmentation in emotion recognition tasks.

Title: Dual Attention Residual U-Net for Accurate Brain Ultrasound Segmentation in IVH Detection
Authors: Dan Yuan, Yi Feng, Ziyun Tang
Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection. Code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Risk-based approach to the Optimal Transmission Switching problem
Authors: Beno√Æt Jeanson, Simon H. Tindemans
Abstract: This paper deals with the secure Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problem in situations where the TSO is forced to accept the risk that some contingencies may result in the de-energization of parts of the grid to avoid the violation of operational limits. This operational policy, which mainly applies to subtransmission systems, is first discussed. Then, a model of that policy is proposed that complements the classical MILP model of the N-1 secure OTS problem. It comprises a connectivity and notably a partial grid loss analysis for branch outage contingencies. Finally, its application to the IEEE 14-bus system is presented. Solutions similar to those observed in operation are reached by the algorithm, notably revealing the preventive-openings-cascade phenomenon.

Title: HRSim: An agent-based simulation platform for high-capacity ride-sharing services
Authors: Wang Chen, Hongzheng Shi, Jintao Ke
Abstract: The rapid growth of ride-sharing services presents a promising solution to urban transportation challenges, such as congestion and carbon emissions. However, developing efficient operational strategies, such as pricing, matching, and fleet management, requires robust simulation tools that can replicate real-world dynamics at scale. Existing platforms often lack the capacity, flexibility, or open-source accessibility needed to support large-scale, high-capacity ride-sharing services. To address these gaps, we introduce HRSim, an open-source, agent-based High-capacity Ride-sharing Simulator. HRSim integrates real-world road networks and demand data to simulate dynamic ride-sharing operations, including pricing, routing, matching, and repositioning. Its module design supports both ride-sharing and solo-hailing service modes. Also, it includes a visualization module for real-time performance analysis. In addition, HRSim incorporates integer linear programming and heuristic algorithms, which can achieve large-scale simulations of high-capacity ride-sharing services. Applications demonstrate HRSim's utility in various perspectives, including quantifying carbon emissions, scaling ride-sharing performance, evaluating new strategies, etc. By bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, HRSim serves as a versatile testbed for policymakers and transportation network companies to optimize ride-sharing systems for efficiency and sustainability.

Title: Periodic Regulation of Linear Time-Delay Systems via Youla-Kuƒçera Parametrization
Authors: Can Kutlu Y√ºksel, Tom√°≈° Vyhl√≠dal, Silviu-Iulian Niculescu
Abstract: The paper proposes an alternative way to achieve the Internal Model Principle (IMP) in contrast to the standard way, where a model of the signal one wishes to track/reject is directly substituted into the closed-loop. The proposed alternative approach relies on an already-existing stabilizing controller, which can be further augmented with a Youla-Kuƒçera parameter to let it implicitly admit a model of a signal without altering its stabilizing feature. Thus, with the proposed method, the standard design steps of realizing IMP are reversed. The validity and potential of the proposed approach are demonstrated by considering three different types of time-delay systems. It is shown through simulations that all considered unstable systems, despite the infinite-dimensional closed-loop, can be straightforwardly periodically regulated by augmenting their stabilizing PI controllers. Thanks to a specifically chosen structure for the Youla-Kuƒçera parameter, the required tuning can be done by solving a set of linear equations.

Title: Source Separation of Small Classical Ensembles: Challenges and Opportunities
Authors: Gerardo Roa-Dabike, Trevor J. Cox, Jon P. Barker, Michael A. Akeroyd, Scott Bannister, Bruno Fazenda, Jennifer Firth, Simone Graetzer, Alinka Greasley, Rebecca R. Vos, William M. Whitmer
Abstract: Musical (MSS) source separation of western popular music using non-causal deep learning can be very effective. In contrast, MSS for classical music is an unsolved problem. Classical ensembles are harder to separate than popular music because of issues such as the inherent greater variation in the music; the sparsity of recordings with ground truth for supervised training; and greater ambiguity between instruments. The Cadenza project has been exploring MSS for classical music. This is being done so music can be remixed to improve listening experiences for people with hearing loss. To enable the work, a new database of synthesized woodwind ensembles was created to overcome instrumental imbalances in the EnsembleSet. For the MSS, a set of ConvTasNet models was used with each model being trained to extract a string or woodwind instrument. ConvTasNet was chosen because it enabled both causal and non-causal approaches to be tested. Non-causal approaches have dominated MSS work and are useful for recorded music, but for live music or processing on hearing aids, causal signal processing is needed. The MSS performance was evaluated on the two small datasets (Bach10 and URMP) of real instrument recordings where the ground-truth is available. The performances of the causal and non-causal systems were similar. Comparing the average Signal-to-Distortion (SDR) of the synthesized validation set (6.2 dB causal; 6.9 non-causal), to the real recorded evaluation set (0.3 dB causal, 0.4 dB non-causal), shows that mismatch between synthesized and recorded data is a problem. Future work needs to either gather more real recordings that can be used for training, or to improve the realism and diversity of the synthesized recordings to reduce the mismatch...

Title: Sufficient Conditions for Detectability of Approximately Discretized Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Seth Siriya, Julian D. Schiller, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. M√ºller
Abstract: In many sampled-data applications, observers are designed based on approximately discretized models of continuous-time systems, where usually only the discretized system is analyzed in terms of its detectability. In this paper, we show that if the continuous-time system satisfies certain linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions, and the sampling period of the discretization scheme is sufficiently small, then the whole family of discretized systems (parameterized by the sampling period) satisfies analogous discrete-time LMI conditions that imply detectability. Our results are applicable to general discretization schemes, as long as they produce approximate models whose linearizations are in some sense consistent with the linearizations of the continuous-time ones. We explicitly show that the Euler and second-order Runge-Kutta methods satisfy this condition. A batch-reactor system example is provided to highlight the usefulness of our results from a practical perspective.

Title: LLM4SP: Large Language Models for Scatterer Prediction via Synesthesia of Machines
Authors: Zengrui Han, Lu Bai, Ziwei Huang, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: Guided by Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), the nonlinear mapping relationship between sensory and communication information serves as a powerful tool to enhance both the accuracy and generalization of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To explore the general mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new intelligent sensing-communication integration dataset, named V2V-M3, is constructed for multiple scenarios in V2V communications with multiple frequency bands and multiple vehicular traffic densities (VTDs). Leveraging the strong representation and cross-modal inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a novel LLM-based method for Scatterer Prediction (LLM4SP) from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds is developed. To address the inherent and significant differences across multi-modal data, synergistically optimized four-module architecture, i.e., preprocessor, embedding, backbone, and output modules, are designed by considering the sensing/channel characteristics and electromagnetic propagation mechanism. On the basis of cross-modal representation alignment and positional encoding, the network of LLM4SP is fine-tuned to capture the general mapping relationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4SP achieves superior performance in full-sample and generalization testing, significantly outperforming small models across different frequency bands, scenarios, and VTDs.

Title: UltraBoneUDF: Self-supervised Bone Surface Reconstruction from Ultrasound Based on Neural Unsigned Distance Functions
Authors: Luohong Wu, Matthias Seibold, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Giuseppe Loggia, Lisa Reissner, Bastian Sigrist, Jonas Hein, Lilian Calvet, Arnd Vieh√∂fer, Philipp F√ºrnstahl
Abstract: Background: Bone surface reconstruction plays a critical role in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable alternative. Continuous bone surface reconstruction can be employed for many clinical applications. However, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically capture only partial bone surfaces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such incomplete data, leading to artifacts and increased reconstruction errors. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing thin and open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. Methods: We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound using neural Unsigned Distance Functions. To enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce a novel global feature extractor that effectively fuses ultrasound-specific image characteristics. Additionally, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and baseline models are extensively evaluated on four open-source datasets. Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 1.10 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (39.6\% improvement compared to the SOTA), 0.23 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset (69.3\% improvement), 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset (70.2\% improvement), and 0.05 mm on the Prostate dataset (55.3\% improvement).

Title: Promptable cancer segmentation using minimal expert-curated data
Authors: Lynn Karam, Yipei Wang, Veeru Kasivisvanathan, Mirabela Rusu, Yipeng Hu, Shaheer U. Saeed
Abstract: Automated segmentation of cancer on medical images can aid targeted diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, its adoption is limited by the high cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer variability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some challenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring full segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images, which are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow segmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing models perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large datasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable segmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8 weakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high standard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability of obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one weakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation through a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our approach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs comparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer segmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less). This enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that the labels can be curated to a very high standard.

Title: Selection Mechanisms for Sequence Modeling using Linear State Space Models
Authors: Umberto Casti, Sandro Zampieri, Fabio Pasqualetti
Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling tasks have been driven by architectures such as Transformers and, more recently, by Selective State Space Models (SSMs). In this paper, we introduce an alternative selection mechanism inspired by control theory methodologies. Specifically, we propose a novel residual generator for selection, drawing an analogy to fault detection strategies in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike Mamba, which utilizes Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems, our approach combines multiple LTI systems, preserving their beneficial properties during training while achieving comparable selectivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we test its performance on synthetic tasks. While these tasks are not inherently critical, they serve as benchmarks to test the selectivity properties of different cores architecture. This work highlights the potential of integrating theoretical insights with experimental advancements, offering a complementary perspective to deep learning innovations at the intersection of control theory and machine learning.

Title: Faulty RIS-aided Integrated Sensing and Communication: Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Lu Wang, Gui Zhou, Changheng Li, Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Nairy Moghadas Gholian, Matthias Hollick, Arash Asadi
Abstract: This work investigates a practical reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a subset of RIS elements fail to function properly and reflect incident signals randomly towards unintended directions, thereby degrading system performance. To date, no study has addressed such impairments caused by faulty RIS elements in ISAC systems. This work aims to fill the gap. First, to quantify the impact of faulty elements on ISAC performance, we derive the misspecified Cram√©r-Rao bound (MCRB) for sensing parameter estimation and signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for communication quality. Then, to mitigate the performance loss caused by faulty elements, we jointly design the remaining functional RIS phase shifts and transmit beamforming to minimize the MCRB, subject to the communication SINR and transmit power constraints. The resulting optimization problem is highly non-convex due to the intricate structure of the MCRB expression and constant-modulus constraint imposed on RIS. To address this, we reformulate it into a more tractable form and propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that incorporates majorization-minimization (MM), successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach reduces the MCRB performance loss by 24.36% on average compared to the case where the presence of faulty elements is ignored. Furthermore, the performance gain becomes more evident as the number of faulty elements increases.

Title: Explainable Anatomy-Guided AI for Prostate MRI: Foundation Models and In Silico Clinical Trials for Virtual Biopsy-based Risk Assessment
Authors: Danial Khan, Zohaib Salahuddin, Yumeng Zhang, Sheng Kuang, Shruti Atul Mali, Henry C. Woodruff, Sina Amirrajab, Rachel Cavill, Eduardo Ibor-Crespo, Ana Jimenez-Pastor, Adrian Galiana-Bordera, Paula Jimenez Gomez, Luis Marti-Bonmati, Philippe Lambin
Abstract: We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and 617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing). Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone), and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69 to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79, composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners. Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions, enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to 0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in clinical practice.

Title: Preliminary Characterization of Bio-inspired Dog-Nose Sampler for Aerosol Detection
Authors: Yahya Naveed, Julia Gersey, Pei Zhang
Abstract: Before aerosols can be sensed, sampling technologies must capture the particulate matter of interest. To that end, for systems deployed in open environments where the location of the aerosol is unknown, extending the reach of the sampler could lessen the precision required in sensor placement or reduce the number of sensors required for full spatial coverage. Inspired by the sensitivity of the canine olfactory system, this paper presents a rudimentary sampler that mimics the air flow of a dog's nose. The design consists of speed-controlled inhalation jets, as well as exhalation jets that are angled down and to the side. We tested this design on volatile organic compounds (VOC) in a small number of scenarios to validate the concept and understand how the system behaves. We show that in preliminary testing this dog-nose setup provides improvements over passive and solely inhalation sensing.

Title: Transient Slack Capability
Authors: Rodrigo Bernal, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Transient Slack Capability (TSC), a set of three necessary device-level conditions to ensure stability under sustained power perturbations. TSC states that a device must (1) possess sufficient stored energy; (2) a controlled input power; and (3) maintain internal energy balance and synchronization. The paper shows that the relation among the time-scales of storage, control, and power perturbation is at the core of the TSC concept. Using the port-Hamiltonian (PH) framework, these conditions are formalized and validated via simulations on an adapted model of the WSCC 9-bus system. Case studies demonstrate that TSC is achievable in both Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) converter control schemes, provided the conditions above are satisfied. Sensitivity analysis serves to identify storage and power reserve requirements to meet Conditions 1 and 2; the impact of converter current limiters on Condition 3; and inertia-less solutions able to achieve TSC.

Title: Effects of auditory distance cues and reverberation on spatial perception and listening strategies
Authors: Fulvio Missoni, Katarina Poole, Lorenzo Picinali, Andrea Canessa
Abstract: Spatial hearing, the brain's ability to use auditory cues to identify the origin of sounds, is crucial for everyday listening. While simplified paradigms have advanced the understanding of spatial hearing, their lack of ecological validity limits their applicability to real-life conditions. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the effects of listener movement, reverberation, and distance on localisation accuracy in a more ecologically valid context. Participants performed active localisation tasks with no specific instructions on listening strategy, in either anechoic or reverberant conditions. The results indicate that the head movements were more frequent in reverberant environments, suggesting an adaptive strategy to mitigate uncertainty in binaural cues due to reverberation. While distance did not affect the listening strategy, it influenced the localisation performance. Our outcomes suggest that listening behaviour is adapted depending on the current acoustic conditions to support an effective perception of the space.

Title: A Foundation Model Framework for Multi-View MRI Classification of Extramural Vascular Invasion and Mesorectal Fascia Invasion in Rectal Cancer
Authors: Yumeng Zhang, Zohaib Salahuddin, Danial Khan, Shruti Atul Mali, Henry C. Woodruff, Sina Amirrajab, Eduardo Ibor-Crespo, Ana Jimenez-Pastor, Luis Marti-Bonmati, Philippe Lambin
Abstract: Background: Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion (EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is pivotal for risk-stratified management of rectal cancer, yet visual assessment is subjective and vulnerable to inter-institutional variability. Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1 score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74). The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images (AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75). Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet) underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization, and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal MRI.

Title: Analysis on Energy Efficiency of RIS-Assisted Multiuser Downlink Near-Field Communications
Authors: Wei Wang, Xiaoyu Ou, Zhihan Ren, Waqas Bin Abbas, Shuping Dang, Angela Doufexi, Mark A. Beach
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the energy efficiency (EE) optimization and analysis of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiuser downlink near-field communications. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study on several key factors affecting EE performance, including the number of RIS elements, the types of reconfigurable elements, reconfiguration resolutions, and the maximum transmit power. To accurately capture the power characteristics of RISs, we adopt more practical power consumption models for three commonly used reconfigurable elements in RISs: PIN diodes, varactor diodes, and radio frequency (RF) switches. These different elements may result in RIS systems exhibiting significantly different energy efficiencies (EEs), even when their spectral efficiencies (SEs) are similar. Considering discrete phases implemented at most RISs in practice, which makes their optimization NP-hard, we develop a nested alternating optimization framework to maximize EE, consisting of an outer integer-based optimization for discrete RIS phase reconfigurations and a nested non-convex optimization for continuous transmit power allocation within each iteration. Extensive comparisons with multiple benchmark schemes validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. Furthermore, based on the proposed optimization method, we analyze the EE performance of RISs across different key factors and identify the optimal RIS architecture yielding the highest EE.

Title: Accelerating Learned Image Compression Through Modeling Neural Training Dynamics
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Zhihao Duan, Yuning Huang, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: As learned image compression (LIC) methods become increasingly computationally demanding, enhancing their training efficiency is crucial. This paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing efficient training methods for LICs.

Title: Interpreting Deep Neural Network-Based Receiver Under Varying Signal-To-Noise Ratios
Authors: Marko Tuononen, Dani Korpi, Ville Hautam√§ki
Abstract: We propose a novel method for interpreting neural networks, focusing on convolutional neural network-based receiver model. The method identifies which unit or units of the model contain most (or least) information about the channel parameter(s) of the interest, providing insights at both global and local levels -- with global explanations aggregating local ones. Experiments on link-level simulations demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying units that contribute most (and least) to signal-to-noise ratio processing. Although we focus on a radio receiver model, the method generalizes to other neural network architectures and applications, offering robust estimation even in high-dimensional settings.

Title: Lightweight Multispectral Crop-Weed Segmentation for Precision Agriculture
Authors: Zeynep Galymzhankyzy, Eric Martinson
Abstract: Efficient crop-weed segmentation is critical for site-specific weed control in precision agriculture. Conventional CNN-based methods struggle to generalize and rely on RGB imagery, limiting performance under complex field conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight transformer-CNN hybrid. It processes RGB, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Red-Edge (RE) bands using specialized encoders and dynamic modality integration. Evaluated on the WeedsGalore dataset, the model achieves a segmentation accuracy (mean IoU) of 78.88%, outperforming RGB-only models by 15.8 percentage points. With only 8.7 million parameters, the model offers high accuracy, computational efficiency, and potential for real-time deployment on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and edge devices, advancing precision weed management.

Title: Improving endpoint detection in end-to-end streaming ASR for conversational speech
Authors: Anandh C, Karthik Pandia Durai, Jeena Prakash, Manickavela Arumugam, Kadri Hacioglu, S.Pavankumar Dubagunta, Andreas Stolcke, Shankar Venkatesan, Aravind Ganapathiraju
Abstract: ASR endpointing (EP) plays a major role in delivering a good user experience in products supporting human or artificial agents in human-human/machine conversations. Transducer-based ASR (T-ASR) is an end-to-end (E2E) ASR modelling technique preferred for streaming. A major limitation of T-ASR is delayed emission of ASR outputs, which could lead to errors or delays in EP. Inaccurate EP will cut the user off while speaking, returning incomplete transcript while delays in EP will increase the perceived latency, degrading the user experience. We propose methods to improve EP by addressing delayed emission along with EP mistakes. To address the delayed emission problem, we introduce an end-of-word token at the end of each word, along with a delay penalty. The EP delay is addressed by obtaining a reliable frame-level speech activity detection using an auxiliary network. We apply the proposed methods on Switchboard conversational speech corpus and evaluate it against a delay penalty method.

Title: Impact of Frame Rates on Speech Tokenizer: A Case Study on Mandarin and English
Authors: Haoyang Zhang, Hexin Liu, Xiangyu Zhang, Qiquan Zhang, Yuchen Hu, Junqi Zhao, Fei Tian, Xuerui Yang, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.

Title: Large Language Models Implicitly Learn to See and Hear Just By Reading
Authors: Prateek Verma, Mert Pilanci
Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Title: Semantic-Aware Interpretable Multimodal Music Auto-Tagging
Authors: Andreas Patakis, Vassilis Lyberatos, Spyridon Kantarelis, Edmund Dervakos, Giorgos Stamou
Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing, deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric music tagging systems.

Title: ConvoyNext: A Scalable Testbed Platform for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Systems
Authors: Hossein Maghsoumi, Yaser Fallah
Abstract: The advancement of cooperative autonomous vehicle systems depends heavily on effective coordination between multiple agents, aiming to enhance traffic efficiency, fuel economy, and road safety. Despite these potential benefits, real-world testing of such systems remains a major challenge and is essential for validating control strategies, trajectory modeling methods, and communication robustness across diverse environments. To address this need, we introduce ConvoyNext, a scalable, modular, and extensible platform tailored for the real-world evaluation of cooperative driving behaviors. We demonstrate the capabilities of ConvoyNext through a series of experiments involving convoys of autonomous vehicles navigating complex trajectories. These tests highlight the platform's robustness across heterogeneous vehicle configurations and its effectiveness in assessing convoy behavior under varying communication conditions, including intentional packet loss. Our results validate ConvoyNext as a comprehensive, open-access testbed for advancing research in cooperative autonomous vehicle systems.

Title: Construction of an Impedance Control Test Bench

Abstract: Controlling the physical interaction with the environment or objects, as humans do, is a shared requirement across different types of robots. To effectively control this interaction, it is necessary to control the power delivered to the load, that is, the interaction force and the interaction velocity. However, it is not possible to control these two quantities independently at the same time. An alternative is to control the relation between them, with Impedance and Admittance control, for example. The Impedance Control 2 Dimensions (IC2D) bench is a test bench designed to allow the performance analysis of different actuators and controllers at the joint level. Therefore, it was designed to be as versatile as possible, to allow the combination of linear and/or rotational motions, to use electric and/or hydraulic actuators, with loads known and defined by the user. The bench adheres to a set of requirements defined by the demands of the research group, to be a reliable, backlash-free mechatronic system to validate system dynamics models and controller designs, as well as a valuable experimental setup for benchmarking electric and hydraulic actuators. This article presents the mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic configurations used to ensure the robustness and reliability of the test bench. Benches similar to this one are commonly found in robotics laboratories around the world. However, the IC2D stands out for its versatility and reliability, as well as for supporting hydraulic and electric actuators.

Title: UAV Control with Vision-based Hand Gesture Recognition over Edge-Computing
Authors: Sousannah Abdalla, Sabur Baidya
Abstract: Gesture recognition presents a promising avenue for interfacing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to its intuitive nature and potential for precise interaction. This research conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of vision-based hand gesture detection methodologies tailored for UAV Control. The existing gesture recognition approaches involving cropping, zooming, and color-based segmentation, do not work well for this kind of applications in dynamic conditions and suffer in performance with increasing distance and environmental noises. We propose to use a novel approach leveraging hand landmarks drawing and classification for gesture recognition based UAV control. With experimental results we show that our proposed method outperforms the other existing methods in terms of accuracy, noise resilience, and efficacy across varying distances, thus providing robust control decisions. However, implementing the deep learning based compute intensive gesture recognition algorithms on the UAV's onboard computer is significantly challenging in terms of performance. Hence, we propose to use a edge-computing based framework to offload the heavier computing tasks, thus achieving closed-loop real-time performance. With implementation over AirSim simulator as well as over a real-world UAV, we showcase the advantage of our end-to-end gesture recognition based UAV control system.

Title: Benchmarking Expressive Japanese Character Text-to-Speech with VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2
Authors: Zackary Rackauckas, Julia Hirschberg
Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due to pitch-accent sensitivity and stylistic variability. This paper benchmarks two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra (SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate), and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS. Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue generation, despite higher computational demands.

Title: VoxRAG: A Step Toward Transcription-Free RAG Systems in Spoken Question Answering
Authors: Zackary Rackauckas, Julia Hirschberg
Abstract: We introduce VoxRAG, a modular speech-to-speech retrieval-augmented generation system that bypasses transcription to retrieve semantically relevant audio segments directly from spoken queries. VoxRAG employs silence-aware segmentation, speaker diarization, CLAP audio embeddings, and FAISS retrieval using L2-normalized cosine similarity. We construct a 50-query test set recorded as spoken input by a native English speaker. Retrieval quality was evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge annotations. For very relevant segments, cosine similarity achieved a Recall@10 of 0.34. For somewhat relevant segments, Recall@10 rose to 0.60 and nDCG@10 to 0.27, highlighting strong topical alignment. Answer quality was judged on a 0--2 scale across relevance, accuracy, completeness, and precision, with mean scores of 0.84, 0.58, 0.56, and 0.46 respectively. While precision and retrieval quality remain key limitations, VoxRAG shows that transcription-free speech-to-speech retrieval is feasible in RAG systems.

Title: Dual Ascent Diffusion for Inverse Problems
Authors: Minseo Kim, Axel Levy, Gordon Wetzstein
Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster, and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than the state of the art.

Title: From Flight to Insight: Semantic 3D Reconstruction for Aerial Inspection via Gaussian Splatting and Language-Guided Segmentation
Authors: Mahmoud Chick Zaouali, Todd Charter, Homayoun Najjaran
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but similarly lack scene-level understanding. In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding.

Title: LLM-based Generative Error Correction for Rare Words with Synthetic Data and Phonetic Context
Authors: Natsuo Yamashita, Masaaki Yamamoto, Hiroaki Kokubo, Yohei Kawaguchi
Abstract: Generative error correction (GER) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as an effective post-processing approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. However, it often struggles with rare or domain-specific words due to limited training data. Furthermore, existing LLM-based GER approaches primarily rely on textual information, neglecting phonetic cues, which leads to over-correction. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based GER approach that targets rare words and incorporates phonetic information. First, we generate synthetic data to contain rare words for fine-tuning the GER model. Second, we integrate ASR's N-best hypotheses along with phonetic context to mitigate over-correction. Experimental results show that our method not only improves the correction of rare words but also reduces the WER and CER across both English and Japanese datasets.

Title: Adaptive Implicit-Based Deep Learning Channel Estimation for 6G Communications
Authors: Zhen Qiao, Jiang Xue, Junkai Zhang, Guanzhang Liu, Xiaoqin Ma, Runhua Li, Faheem A. Khan, John S. Thompson, Zongben Xu
Abstract: With the widespread deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, research on sixth-generation (6G) technology is gaining momentum. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is anticipated to play a significant role in 6G, particularly through integration with the physical layer for tasks such as channel estimation. Considering resource limitations in real systems, the AI algorithm should be designed to have the ability to balance the accuracy and resource consumption according to the scenarios dynamically. However, conventional explicit multilayer-stacked Deep Learning (DL) models struggle to adapt due to their heavy reliance on the structure of deep neural networks. This article proposes an adaptive Implicit-layer DL Channel Estimation Network (ICENet) with a lightweight framework for vehicle-to-everything communications. This novel approach balances computational complexity and channel estimation accuracy by dynamically adjusting computational resources based on input data conditions, such as channel quality. Unlike explicit multilayer-stacked DL-based channel estimation models, ICENet offers a flexible framework, where specific requirements can be achieved by adaptively changing the number of iterations of the iterative layer. Meanwhile, ICENet requires less memory while maintaining high performance. The article concludes by highlighting open research challenges and promising future research directions.

Title: UniTTS: An end-to-end TTS system without decoupling of acoustic and semantic information
Authors: Rui Wang, Qianguo Sun, Tianrong Chen, Zhiyun Zeng, Junlong Wu, Jiaxing Zhang
Abstract: The emergence of multi-codebook neutral audio codecs such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) and Group Vector Quantization (GVQ) has significantly advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. These codecs are crucial in separating semantic and acoustic information while efficiently harnessing semantic priors. However, since semantic and acoustic information cannot be fully aligned, a significant drawback of these methods when applied to LLM-based TTS is that large language models may have limited access to comprehensive audio information. To address this limitation, we propose DistilCodec and UniTTS, which collectively offer the following advantages: 1) This method can distill a multi-codebook audio codec into a single-codebook audio codec with 32,768 codes while achieving a near 100\% utilization. 2) As DistilCodec does not employ a semantic alignment scheme, a large amount of high-quality unlabeled audio (such as audiobooks with sound effects, songs, etc.) can be incorporated during training, further expanding data diversity and broadening its applicability. 3) Leveraging the comprehensive audio information modeling of DistilCodec, we integrated three key tasks into UniTTS's pre-training framework: audio modality autoregression, text modality autoregression, and speech-text cross-modal autoregression. This allows UniTTS to accept interleaved text and speech/audio prompts while substantially preserving LLM's text capabilities. 4) UniTTS employs a three-stage training process: Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Alignment.

Title: Exploring the Effect of Segmentation and Vocabulary Size on Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models
Authors: Shunsuke Kando, Yusuke Miyao, Shinnosuke Takamichi
Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.

Title: Reverse-Speech-Finder: A Neural Network Backtracking Architecture for Generating Alzheimer's Disease Speech Samples and Improving Diagnosis Performance
Authors: Victor OK Li, Yang Han, Jacqueline CK Lam, Lawrence YL Cheung
Abstract: This study introduces Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF), a groundbreaking neural network backtracking architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis through speech analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained large language models, RSF identifies and utilizes the most probable AD-specific speech markers, addressing both the scarcity of real AD speech samples and the challenge of limited interpretability in existing models. RSF's unique approach consists of three core innovations: Firstly, it exploits the observation that speech markers most probable of predicting AD, defined as the most probable speech-markers (MPMs), must have the highest probability of activating those neurons (in the neural network) with the highest probability of predicting AD, defined as the most probable neurons (MPNs). Secondly, it utilizes a speech token representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to identify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input layer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously uncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results demonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost in F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not only mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings underscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD detection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving the way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies.

Title: ExARNN: An Environment-Driven Adaptive RNN for Learning Non-Stationary Power Dynamics
Authors: Haoran Li, Muhao Guo, Yang Weng, Marija Ilic, Guangchun Ruan
Abstract: Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.

Title: Analyzing Mitigation Strategies for Catastrophic Forgetting in End-to-End Training of Spoken Language Models
Authors: Chi-Yuan Hsiao, Ke-Han Lu, Kai-Wei Chang, Chih-Kai Yang, Wei-Chih Chen, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.

Title: What You Read Isn't What You Hear: Linguistic Sensitivity in Deepfake Speech Detection
Authors: Binh Nguyen, Shuji Shi, Ryan Ofman, Thai Le
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam, using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors. These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems. All source code will be publicly available.

Title: Swedish Whispers; Leveraging a Massive Speech Corpus for Swedish Speech Recognition
Authors: Leonora Vesterbacka, Faton Rekathati, Robin Kurtz, Justyna Sikora, Agnes Toftg√•rd
Abstract: This work presents a suite of fine-tuned Whisper models for Swedish, trained on a dataset of unprecedented size and variability for this mid-resourced language. As languages of smaller sizes are often underrepresented in multilingual training datasets, substantial improvements in performance can be achieved by fine-tuning existing multilingual models, as shown in this work. This work reports an overall improvement across model sizes compared to OpenAI's Whisper evaluated on Swedish. Most notably, we report an average 47% reduction in WER comparing our best performing model to OpenAI's whisper-large-v3, in evaluations across FLEURS, Common Voice, and NST.

Title: MEGADance: Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Genre-Aware 3D Dance Generation
Authors: Kaixing Yang, Xulong Tang, Ziqiao Peng, Yuxuan Hu, Jun He, Hongyan Liu
Abstract: Music-driven 3D dance generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, with promising applications in choreography, virtual reality, and creative content creation. Previous research has generated promising realistic dance movement from audio signals. However, traditional methods underutilize genre conditioning, often treating it as auxiliary modifiers rather than core semantic drivers. This oversight compromises music-motion synchronization and disrupts dance genre continuity, particularly during complex rhythmic transitions, thereby leading to visually unsatisfactory effects. To address the challenge, we propose MEGADance, a novel architecture for music-driven 3D dance generation. By decoupling choreographic consistency into dance generality and genre specificity, MEGADance demonstrates significant dance quality and strong genre controllability. It consists of two stages: (1) High-Fidelity Dance Quantization Stage (HFDQ), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and reconstructs them with kinematic-dynamic constraints, and (2) Genre-Aware Dance Generation Stage (GADG), which maps music into the latent representation by synergistic utilization of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with Mamba-Transformer hybrid backbone. Extensive experiments on the FineDance and AIST++ dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MEGADance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Enhancing Fourier-based Doppler Resolution with Diffusion Models
Authors: Denisa Qosja, Kilian Barth, Simon Wagner
Abstract: In radar systems, high resolution in the Doppler dimension is important for detecting slow-moving targets as it allows for more distinct separation between these targets and clutter, or stationary objects. However, achieving sufficient resolution is constrained by hardware capabilities and physical factors, leading to the development of processing techniques to enhance the resolution after acquisition. In this work, we leverage artificial intelligence to increase the Doppler resolution in range-Doppler maps. Based on a zero-padded FFT, a refinement via the generative neural networks of diffusion models is achieved. We demonstrate that our method overcomes the limitations of traditional FFT, generating data where closely spaced targets are effectively separated.

Title: JALMBench: Benchmarking Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Audio Language Models
Authors: Zifan Peng, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Mingchen Li, Zeren Luo, Jingyi Zheng, Wenhan Dong, Xinlei He, Xuechao Wang, Yingjie Xue, Shengmin Xu, Xinyi Huang
Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have made significant progress recently. These models integrate the audio modality directly into the model, rather than converting speech into text and inputting text to Large Language Models (LLMs). While jailbreak attacks on LLMs have been extensively studied, the security of ALMs with audio modalities remains largely unexplored. Currently, there is a lack of an adversarial audio dataset and a unified framework specifically designed to evaluate and compare attacks and ALMs. In this paper, we present JALMBench, the \textit{first} comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of ALMs against jailbreak attacks. JALMBench includes a dataset containing 2,200 text samples and 51,381 audio samples with over 268 hours. It supports 12 mainstream ALMs, 4 text-transferred and 4 audio-originated attack methods, and 5 defense methods. Using JALMBench, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack efficiency, topic sensitivity, voice diversity, and attack representations. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies for the attacks at both the prompt level and the response level.

Title: CosyVoice 3: Towards In-the-wild Speech Generation via Scaling-up and Post-training
Authors: Zhihao Du, Changfeng Gao, Yuxuan Wang, Fan Yu, Tianyu Zhao, Hao Wang, Xiang Lv, Hui Wang, Xian Shi, Keyu An, Guanrou Yang, Yabin Li, Yanni Chen, Zhifu Gao, Qian Chen, Yue Gu, Mengzhe Chen, Yafeng Chen, Shiliang Zhang, Wen Wang, Jieping Ye
Abstract: In our prior works, we introduced a scalable streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which integrates a large language model (LLM) and a chunk-aware flow matching (FM) model, and achieves low-latency bi-streaming speech synthesis and human-parity quality. Despite these advancements, CosyVoice 2 exhibits limitations in language coverage, domain diversity, data volume, text formats, and post-training techniques. In this paper, we present CosyVoice 3, an improved model designed for zero-shot multilingual speech synthesis in the wild, surpassing its predecessor in content consistency, speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. Key features of CosyVoice 3 include: 1) A novel speech tokenizer to improve prosody naturalness, developed via supervised multi-task training, including automatic speech recognition, speech emotion recognition, language identification, audio event detection, and speaker analysis. 2) A new differentiable reward model for post-training applicable not only to CosyVoice 3 but also to other LLM-based speech synthesis models. 3) Dataset Size Scaling: Training data is expanded from ten thousand hours to one million hours, encompassing 9 languages and 18 Chinese dialects across various domains and text formats. 4) Model Size Scaling: Model parameters are increased from 0.5 billion to 1.5 billion, resulting in enhanced performance on our multilingual benchmark due to the larger model capacity. These advancements contribute significantly to the progress of speech synthesis in the wild. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at this https URL.

Title: Characterization of IRS-aided Indoor Wireless Virtual-Reality with Hybrid Beamforming
Authors: Nasim Alikhani, Abbas Mohammadi
Abstract: This paper introduces an optimum solution for a utility function that increases spectral efficiency in wireless Virtual Reality (VR) systems. This system uses Multi-user Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MU-MIMO OFDM) with hybrid beamforming in indoor Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) based Downlink (DL) scenario. Given the critical need to maximize the rate for transmitting VR traffic to meet the low-latency requirements, a substantial bandwidth allocation is essential. This bandwidth is assumed to be in the mmWave band, according to the IEEE 802.11ad/ay standard. The proposed utility function takes into account various delays, including processing, transmission and queuing delays, on both DL and Uplink (UL). Moreover, the relation between transmission delay and the utility function is examined in different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels, using both mean and minimum channel gain metrics. An optimization approach is applied to iteratively determine the IRS phase shifts and effective channel gain. The simulation results are benchmarked against NS3 simulations, showing a high degree of consistency. With an average accuracy of 81.57% the calculated DL and UL rates match the NS3 results when considering the IRS. Also, our proposed method achieves superior performance in the case of complexity over the existing designs.

Title: Unsupervised Clustering for Fault Analysis in High-Voltage Power Systems Using Voltage and Current Signals
Authors: Julian Oelhaf, Georg Kordowich, Andreas Maier, Johann Jager, Siming Bayer
Abstract: The widespread use of sensors in modern power grids has led to the accumulation of large amounts of voltage and current waveform data, especially during fault events. However, the lack of labeled datasets poses a significant challenge for fault classification and analysis. This paper explores the application of unsupervised clustering techniques for fault diagnosis in high-voltage power systems. A dataset provided by the Reseau de Transport d'Electricite (RTE) is analyzed, with frequency domain features extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The K-Means algorithm is then applied to identify underlying patterns in the data, enabling automated fault categorization without the need for labeled training samples. The resulting clusters are evaluated in collaboration with power system experts to assess their alignment with real-world fault characteristics. The results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised learning for scalable and data-driven fault analysis, providing a robust approach to detecting and classifying power system faults with minimal prior assumptions.

Title: TEDI: Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators to Analyze and Compare Dataset Documentation
Authors: Wiebke Hutiri, Mircea Cimpoi, Morgan Scheuerman, Victoria Matthews, Alice Xiang
Abstract: Dataset transparency is a key enabler of responsible AI, but insights into multimodal dataset attributes that impact trustworthy and ethical aspects of AI applications remain scarce and are difficult to compare across datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators (TEDI) that facilitate the systematic, empirical analysis of dataset documentation. TEDI encompasses 143 fine-grained indicators that characterize trustworthy and ethical attributes of multimodal datasets and their collection processes. The indicators are framed to extract verifiable information from dataset documentation. Using TEDI, we manually annotated and analyzed over 100 multimodal datasets that include human voices. We further annotated data sourcing, size, and modality details to gain insights into the factors that shape trustworthy and ethical dimensions across datasets. We find that only a select few datasets have documented attributes and practices pertaining to consent, privacy, and harmful content indicators. The extent to which these and other ethical indicators are addressed varies based on the data collection method, with documentation of datasets collected via crowdsourced and direct collection approaches being more likely to mention them. Scraping dominates scale at the cost of ethical indicators, but is not the only viable collection method. Our approach and empirical insights contribute to increasing dataset transparency along trustworthy and ethical dimensions and pave the way for automating the tedious task of extracting information from dataset documentation in future.

Title: TransDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment
Authors: Hao Wang, Licheng Pan, Zhichao Chen, Xu Chen, Qingyang Dai, Lei Wang, Haoxuan Li, Zhouchen Lin
Abstract: Training time-series forecasting models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecasting models. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Toward Optimal ANC: Establishing Mutual Information Lower Bound
Authors: Fran√ßois Derrida, Shahar Lutati, Eliya Nachmani
Abstract: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms aim to suppress unwanted acoustic disturbances by generating anti-noise signals that destructively interfere with the original noise in real time. Although recent deep learning-based ANC algorithms have set new performance benchmarks, there remains a shortage of theoretical limits to rigorously assess their improvements. To address this, we derive a unified lower bound on cancellation performance composed of two components. The first component is information-theoretic: it links residual error power to the fraction of disturbance entropy captured by the anti-noise signal, thereby quantifying limits imposed by information-processing capacity. The second component is support-based: it measures the irreducible error arising in frequency bands that the cancellation path cannot address, reflecting fundamental physical constraints. By taking the maximum of these two terms, our bound establishes a theoretical ceiling on the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) attainable by any ANC algorithm. We validate its tightness empirically on the NOISEX dataset under varying reverberation times, demonstrating robustness across diverse acoustic conditions.

Title: Automata Learning of Preferences over Temporal Logic Formulas from Pairwise Comparisons
Authors: Hazhar Rahmani, Jie Fu
Abstract: Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences), referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis using a robotic motion planning problem.

Title: Emergence of Hebbian Dynamics in Regularized Non-Local Learners
Authors: David Koplow, Tomaso Poggio, Liu Ziyin
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has emerged as a remarkably effective learning algorithm, underpinning nearly all state-of-the-art machine learning models, from large language models to autonomous vehicles. Despite its practical success, SGD appears fundamentally distinct from biological learning mechanisms. It is widely believed that the biological brain can not implement gradient descent because it is nonlocal, and we have found little (if any) experimental evidence for it. In contrast, the brain is widely thought to learn via local Hebbian learning principles, which have been seen as incompatible with gradient descent. In this paper, we establish a theoretical and empirical connection between the learning signals of neural networks trained using SGD with weight decay and those trained with Hebbian learning near convergence. We show that SGD with regularization can appear to learn according to a Hebbian rule, and SGD with injected noise according to an anti-Hebbian rule. We also provide empirical evidence that Hebbian learning properties can emerge in a network with weight decay from virtually any learning rule--even random ones. These results may bridge a long-standing gap between artificial and biological learning, revealing Hebbian properties as an epiphenomenon of deeper optimization principles and cautioning against interpreting their presence in neural data as evidence against more complex hetero-synaptic mechanisms.

Title: DualTalk: Dual-Speaker Interaction for 3D Talking Head Conversations
Authors: Ziqiao Peng, Yanbo Fan, Haoyu Wu, Xuan Wang, Hongyan Liu, Jun He, Zhaoxin Fan
Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations.

Title: F-ANcGAN: An Attention-Enhanced Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Architecture for Synthetic Image Generation of Nanoparticles
Authors: Varun Ajith, Anindya Pal, Saumik Bhattacharya, Sayantari Ghosh
Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.

Title: An Operator-Theoretic Framework to Simulate Neuromorphic Circuits
Authors: Amir Shahhosseini, Thomas Chaffey, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: Splitting algorithms are well-established in convex optimization and are designed to solve large-scale problems. Using such algorithms to simulate the behavior of nonlinear circuit networks provides scalable methods for the simulation and design of neuromorphic systems. For circuits made of linear capacitors and inductors with nonlinear resistive elements, we propose a splitting that breaks the network into its LTI lossless component and its static resistive component. This splitting has both physical and algorithmic advantages and allows for separate calculations in the time domain and in the frequency domain. To demonstrate the scalability of this approach, a network made from one hundred neurons modeled by the well-known FitzHugh-Nagumo circuit with all-to-all diffusive coupling is simulated.

Title: Soil analysis with machine-learning-based processing of stepped-frequency GPR field measurements: Preliminary study
Authors: Chunlei Xu, Michael Pregesbauer, Naga Sravani Chilukuri, Daniel Windhager, Mahsa Yousefi, Pedro Julian, Lothar Ratschbacher
Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been widely studied as a tool for extracting soil parameters relevant to agriculture and horticulture. When combined with Machine Learning (ML) methods, air-coupled Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave Ground Penetrating Radar (SFCW GPR) measurements could offer a cost-effective way to obtain depth-resolved soil data. As a first step of our study in this direction, we conducted an extensive field survey using a tractor-mounted air-coupled SFCW GPR instrument. Leveraging ML-based data processing, we evaluate the GPR instrument's ability by predicting the apparent electrical conductivity (ECaR) measured by a co-recorded Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) instrument. The large-scale field measurement campaign with 3472 co-registered and geo-located GPR and EMI data samples distributed over approximately 6600 square meters was performed on a golf course. This terrain offers high surface homogeneity but also presents the challenge of subtle soil parameter variations. Based on the results, we discuss challenges in this multi-sensor regression setting and propose the use of the nugget-to-sill ratio as a performance metric for evaluating ML models in agricultural field survey applications.

Title: Conformal Robust Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Yash Patel, Sahana Rayan, Ambuj Tewari
Abstract: End-to-end engineering design pipelines, in which designs are evaluated using concurrently defined optimal controllers, are becoming increasingly common in practice. To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications, such as $H_{\infty}$ and LQR with multiplicative noise, across a collection of engineering control systems.

Title: Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements
Authors: Anubhab Ghosh, Yonina C. Eldar, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.

Title: A complex spatial frequency approach to optimal control of finite-extent linear evolution systems
Authors: Zhexian Li, Athanassios S. Fokas, Ketan Savla
Abstract: We consider the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for one-dimensional linear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) on a finite interval in space. The control is applied as an additive forcing term to PDEs. Existing methods for closed-form optimal control only apply to homogeneous (zero) boundary conditions, often resulting in series representations. In this paper, we consider general smooth boundary conditions. We use the unified transform, namely the Fourier transform restricted to the bounded spatial domain, to decouple PDEs into a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by complex spatial frequency variables. Then, optimal control in the frequency domain is derived using LQR theory for ODEs. The inverse Fourier transform leads to non-causal terms in optimal control corresponding to integrals, over the real line, of future values of unspecified boundary conditions. To eliminate this non-causality, we deform the integrals to well-constructed contours in the complex plane along which the contribution of unknowns vanishes. For the reaction-diffusion equation, we show that the integral representation can be reformulated as a series representation, which leads to a state-feedback convolution form for optimal control, with the boundary conditions appearing as an additive term. In numerical experiments, we illustrate the computational advantages of the integral representation in comparison to the series representation and structural properties of the convolution kernel.

Title: Groupwise Image Registration with Edge-Based Loss for Low-SNR Cardiac MRI
Authors: Xuan Lei, Philip Schniter, Chong Chen, Rizwan Ahmad
Abstract: Purpose: To perform image registration and averaging of multiple free-breathing single-shot cardiac images, where the individual images may have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Methods: To address low SNR encountered in single-shot imaging, especially at low field strengths, we propose a fast deep learning (DL)-based image registration method, called Averaging Morph with Edge Detection (AiM-ED). AiM-ED jointly registers multiple noisy source images to a noisy target image and utilizes a noise-robust pre-trained edge detector to define the training loss. We validate AiM-ED using synthetic late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) images from the MR extended cardiac-torso (MRXCAT) phantom and free-breathing single-shot LGE images from healthy subjects (24 slices) and patients (5 slices) under various levels of added noise. Additionally, we demonstrate the clinical feasibility of AiM-ED by applying it to data from patients (6 slices) scanned on a 0.55T scanner. Results: Compared to a traditional energy-minimization-based image registration method and DL-based VoxelMorph, images registered using AiM-ED exhibit higher values of recovery SNR and three perceptual image quality metrics. An ablation study shows the benefit of both jointly processing multiple source images and using an edge map in AiM-ED. Conclusion: For single-shot LGE imaging, AiM-ED outperforms existing image registration methods in terms of image quality. With fast inference, minimal training data requirements, and robust performance at various noise levels, AiM-ED has the potential to benefit single-shot CMR applications.

Title: SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data
Authors: Mohammad Amin Basiri, Sina Khanmohammadi
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We showcase the application of our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we model the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach.

Title: Auto-Landmark: Acoustic Landmark Dataset and Open-Source Toolkit for Landmark Extraction
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Daijiao Liu, Tianyi Xiao, Cihan Xiao, Tuende Szalay, Mostafa Shahin, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps
Abstract: In the speech signal, acoustic landmarks identify times when the acoustic manifestations of the linguistically motivated distinctive features are most salient. Acoustic landmarks have been widely applied in various domains, including speech recognition, speech depression detection, clinical analysis of speech abnormalities, and the detection of disordered speech. However, there is currently no dataset available that provides precise timing information for landmarks, which has been proven to be crucial for downstream applications involving landmarks. In this paper, we selected the most useful acoustic landmarks based on previous research and annotated the TIMIT dataset with them, based on a combination of phoneme boundary information and manual inspection. Moreover, previous landmark extraction tools were not open source or benchmarked, so to address this, we developed an open source Python-based landmark extraction tool and established a series of landmark detection baselines. The first of their kinds, the dataset with landmark precise timing information, landmark extraction tool and baselines are designed to support a wide variety of future research.

Title: Comparing Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing: Introducing the Multipath Lifetime Map
Authors: J√©rome Eertmans, Enrico Maria Vittuci, Vittorio Degli-Esposti, Laurent Jacques, Claude Oestges
Abstract: With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the radio channel. Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.

Title: Safe PDE Boundary Control with Neural Operators
Authors: Hanjiang Hu, Changliu Liu
Abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we first introduce a neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the feasibility of the trajectory-wise constraint satisfaction of boundary output. Based on the neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving better general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the vanilla and constrained model-free controller baselines. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models
Authors: Tzu-Yuan Huang, Armin Lederer, Nicolas Hoischen, Jan Br√ºdigam, Xuehua Xiao, Stefan Sosnowski, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse dataset is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.

Title: Harnessing Wavefront Curvature and Spatial Correlation in Noncoherent MIMO Communications
Authors: Aniol Mart√≠, Luca Sanguinetti, Meritxell Lamarca, Jaume Riba
Abstract: Noncoherent communication systems have regained interest due to the growing demand for high-mobility and low-latency applications. Most existing studies using large antenna arrays rely on the far-field approximation, which assumes locally plane wavefronts. This assumption becomes inaccurate at higher frequencies and shorter ranges, where wavefront curvature plays a significant role and antenna arrays may operate in the radiative near field. In this letter, we adopt a model for the channel spatial correlation matrix that remains valid in both near and far field scenarios. Using this model, we demonstrate that energy-based noncoherent systems can leverage the benefits of wavefront spherical curvature, even beyond the Fraunhofer distance, revealing that the classical far-field approximation may significantly underestimate system performance. Moreover, we show that large antenna arrays enable the multiplexing of various users even with a noncoherent processing, as well as permitting near-optimal detection with low computational complexity.

Title: Rapid Whole Brain Motion-robust Mesoscale In-vivo MR Imaging using Multi-scale Implicit Neural Representation
Authors: Jun Lyu, Lipeng Ning, William Consagra, Qiang Liu, Richard J. Rushmore, Berkin Bilgic, Yogesh Rathi
Abstract: High-resolution whole-brain in vivo MR imaging at mesoscale resolutions remains challenging due to long scan durations, motion artifacts, and limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study proposes Rotating-view super-resolution (ROVER)-MRI, an unsupervised framework based on multi-scale implicit neural representations (INR), enabling efficient recovery of fine anatomical details from multi-view thick-slice acquisitions. ROVER-MRI employs coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly and continuously encode image structures at multiple spatial scales, simultaneously modeling anatomical continuity and correcting inter-view motion through an integrated registration mechanism. Validation on ex-vivo monkey brain data and multiple in-vivo human datasets demonstrates substantially improved reconstruction performance compared to bicubic interpolation and state-of-the-art regularized least-squares super-resolution reconstruction (LS-SRR) with 2-fold reduction in scan time. Notably, ROVER-MRI achieves an unprecedented whole-brain in-vivo T2-weighted imaging at 180 micron isotropic resolution in only 17 minutes of scan time on a 7T scanner with 22.4% lower relative error compared to LS-SRR. We also demonstrate improved SNR using ROVER-MRI compared to a time-matched 3D GRE acquisition. Quantitative results on several datasets demonstrate better sharpness of the reconstructed images with ROVER-MRI for different super-resolution factors (5 to 11). These findings highlight ROVER-MRI's potential as a rapid, accurate, and motion-resilient mesoscale imaging solution, promising substantial advantages for neuroimaging studies.

Title: SpeechT-RAG: Reliable Depression Detection in LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Speech Timing Information
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Hexin Liu, Qiquan Zhang, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly adopted for health-related tasks, yet their performance in depression detection remains limited when relying solely on text input. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typically enhances LLM capabilities, our experiments indicate that traditional text-based RAG systems struggle to significantly improve depression detection accuracy. This challenge stems partly from the rich depression-relevant information encoded in acoustic speech patterns information that current text-only approaches fail to capture effectively. To address this limitation, we conduct a systematic analysis of temporal speech patterns, comparing healthy individuals with those experiencing depression. Based on our findings, we introduce Speech Timing-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation, SpeechT-RAG, a novel system that leverages speech timing features for both accurate depression detection and reliable confidence estimation. This integrated approach not only outperforms traditional text-based RAG systems in detection accuracy but also enhances uncertainty quantification through a confidence scoring mechanism that naturally extends from the same temporal features. Our unified framework achieves comparable results to fine-tuned LLMs without additional training while simultaneously addressing the fundamental requirements for both accuracy and trustworthiness in mental health assessment.

Authors: Jingwei Hu, Dave Zachariah, Torbj√∂rn Wigren, Petre Stoica
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint input design and parameter estimation for identifying nonlinear system models through the sequential acquisition of measurements while adhering to system constraints. We utilize a receding horizon approach and propose a new scale-invariant input design criterion, which is tailored to continuously updated parameter estimates, along with a new sequential parameter estimator. We demonstrate the ability of the method to design informative experiments online, while steering the system within operational constraints.

Title: Integrated Communication and RIS-aided Track-Before-Detect Radar Sensing
Authors: Georgios Mylonopoulos, Luca Venturino, Emanuele Grossi, Stefano Buzzi, Ciro D'Elia
Abstract: This paper investigates an integrated sensing and communication system where the base station serves multiple downlink users, while employing a passive reconfigurable intelligent surface to detect small, noncooperative airborne targets. We propose a method to design the two-way beampattern of the RIS-assisted monostatic radar, which allows controlling the sidelobe levels in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers, and other scattering objects and avoiding any radar interference to the users. To obtain more favorable system tradeoffs, we exploit the correlation of the target echoes over consecutive scans by resorting to a multi-frame radar detector, which includes a detector, a plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. A numerical analysis is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and to assess the achievable tradeoffs. Our results show that, by increasing the number of scans processed by the radar detector (and therefore its implementation complexity), we can reduce the amount of power dedicated to the radar function while maintaining the same sensing performance (measured in terms of probability of target detection and root mean square error in the estimation of target position); this excess power can be reused to increase the user sum-rate.

Title: Impact of Microphone Array Mismatches to Learning-based Replay Speech Detection
Authors: Michael Neri, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalization of a multi-channel learning-based replay speech detector, which employs adaptive beamforming and detection, across different microphone arrays. In general, deep neural network-based microphone array processing techniques generalize poorly to unseen array types, i.e., showing a significant training-test mismatch of performance. We employ the ReMASC dataset to analyze performance degradation due to inter- and intra-device mismatches, assessing both single- and multi-channel configurations. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning to mitigate the performance loss when transitioning to unseen microphone arrays. Our findings reveal that array mismatches significantly decrease detection accuracy, with intra-device generalization being more robust than inter-device. However, fine-tuning with as little as ten minutes of target data can effectively recover performance, providing insights for practical deployment of replay detection systems in heterogeneous automatic speaker verification environments.

Title: Fourier-Based 3D Multistage Transformer for Aberration Correction in Multicellular Specimens

Abuzahriyeh, Erin Hong, Samara Erin Williams, Nathanael Harrison, Evan Huang, Eun Seok Bae, Alison N. Killilea, David G. Drubin, Ian A. Swinburne, Srigokul Upadhyayula, Eric Betzig
Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.

Title: A Method for Localization of Cellular Users from Call Detail Records
Authors: Steven W. Ellingson
Abstract: A common problem in justice applications is localization of a user of a cellular network using a call detail record (CDR), which typically reveals only the base station and sector to which the user was connected. This precludes precise estimation of location. Instead, one is limited to estimating a region of plausible locations (RPL) using static information such as sector antenna orientation, beamwidth, and locations of nearby base stations. In this paper, we propose a method for RPL estimation in which the shape bounding the RPL is derived from a model of the antenna pattern via the Friis Transmission Equation, and the size of the RPL is determined by mean distance to nearby base stations. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by "best server" analysis of measurements acquired from drive testing in the vicinity of Winter Garden, Florida, observing three 700 MHz-band LTE cellular networks serving this area. Of the 16 sectors evaluated, the aggregate error rate (i.e., fraction of users located outside the RPL estimated for the associated sector) is found to be 1.3%, with worst per-sector error rate of about 13.3% and error rates below 1.8% for 13 of the 16 sectors. The principal difficulty is shown to be estimation of RPL size, which entails a tradeoff between minimizing RPL area (yielding the "tightest" localization) and minimizing error rate.

Title: Physics-informed machine learning for building performance simulation-A review of a nascent field
Authors: Zixin Jiang, Xuezheng Wang, Han Li, Tianzhen Hong, Fengqi You, J√°n Drgo≈àa, Draguna Vrabie, Bing Dong
Abstract: Building performance simulation (BPS) is critical for understanding building dynamics and behavior, analyzing performance of the built environment, optimizing energy efficiency, improving demand flexibility, and enhancing building resilience. However, conducting BPS is not trivial. Traditional BPS relies on an accurate building energy model, mostly physics-based, which depends heavily on detailed building information, expert knowledge, and case-by-case model calibrations, thereby significantly limiting their scalability. With the development of sensing technology and increased data availability, there is a growing attention and interest in data-driven BPS. However, purely data-driven models often suffer from limited generalization ability and a lack of physical consistency, resulting in poor performance in real-world applications. To address these limitations, recent studies have started to incorporate physics priors into data-driven models, a methodology called physics-informed machine learning (PIML). PIML is an emerging field with the definitions, methodologies, evaluation criteria, application scenarios, and future directions that remain open. To bridge those gaps, this study systematically reviews the state-of-art PIML for BPS, offering a comprehensive definition of PIML, and comparing it to traditional BPS approaches regarding data requirements, modeling effort, performance and computation cost. We also summarize the commonly used methodologies, validation approaches, application domains, available data sources, open-source packages and testbeds. In addition, this study provides a general guideline for selecting appropriate PIML models based on BPS applications. Finally, this study identifies key challenges and outlines future research directions, providing a solid foundation and valuable insights to advance R&D of PIML in BPS.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of undiscouted infinite-horizon optimal control for deterministic systems where the classic value iteration does not converge. For such systems, we propose to use the Ces√†ro mean to define the infinite-horizon optimal control problem and the corresponding infinite-horizon value function. Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Ces√†ro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior.

Title: CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Mingxiu Cai, Hanxiao Wang, Gaochang Wu, Tianyou Chai, Xiatian Zhu
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Implicit Neural Representation of Waveform Measurements in Power Systems Waveform Data Analysis
Authors: Narges Ehsani, Vishwanath Saragadam, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad
Abstract: There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of accuracy (<1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.

Title: SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information
Authors: Chih-Kai Yang, Neo Ho, Yen-Ting Piao, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

Title: Distributed Beamforming Using Decentralized Time Synchronization in a Six-Element Array
Authors: Naim Shandi, Jason M. Merlo, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We demonstrate a distributed beamforming and beamsteering from a six-node distributed phased array using fully wireless coordination with decentralized time synchronization. In wireless applications such as distributed beamforming, high-accuracy time synchronization across the array is crucial for high coherent gain. The decentralized time synchronization method employed is based on the average consensus algorithm and the two-way time transfer method presented in our previous work, which achieved picosecond time synchronization with a cabled frequency reference. The system presented in this paper utilizes a centralized wireless frequency transfer method to achieve wireless frequency syntonization in a fully wireless coordination and a distributed computing system architecture. We experimentally evaluate system performance through beamforming and beamsteering to a receiver 16.3 m away from the six-node non-uniformly distributed antenna array, achieving an average coherent gain of 98% of the ideal gain at a carrier frequency of 1.05 GHz. The average time synchronization accuracy achieved was less than 36 ps.

Title: U-SAM: An audio language Model for Unified Speech, Audio, and Music Understanding
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Xianjun Xia, Xinfa Zhu, Lei Xie
Abstract: The text generation paradigm for audio tasks has opened new possibilities for unified audio understanding. However, existing models face significant challenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio types, such as speech, general audio events, and music. Furthermore, their exclusive reliance on cross-entropy loss for alignment often falls short, as it treats all tokens equally and fails to account for redundant audio features, leading to weaker cross-modal alignment. To deal with the above challenges, this paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates specialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large language model (LLM). U-SAM employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector for task-aware feature fusion, dynamically routing and integrating the domain-specific encoder outputs. Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a Semantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant audio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and spectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized models and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, it exhibits emergent capabilities on unseen tasks, showcasing its generalization potential. Code is available (this https URL).

Title: Gaussian Processes in Power Systems: Techniques, Applications, and Future Works
Authors: Bendong Tan, Tong Su, Yu Weng, Ketian Ye, Parikshit Pareek, Petr Vorobev, Hung Nguyen, Junbo Zhao, Deepjyoti Deka
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) has significantly heightened operational complexity and uncertainty in modern power systems. Concurrently, the widespread deployment of smart meters, phasor measurement units (PMUs) and other sensors has generated vast spatiotemporal data streams, enabling advanced data-driven analytics and decision-making in grid operations. In this context, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged as a powerful probabilistic framework, offering uncertainty quantification, non-parametric modeling, and predictive capabilities to enhance power system analysis and control. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GP techniques and their applications in power system operation and control. GP applications are reviewed across three key domains: GP-based modeling, risk assessment, and optimization and control. These areas serve as representative examples of how GP can be utilized in power systems. Furthermore, critical challenges in GP applications are discussed, and potential research directions are outlined to facilitate future power system operations.

Title: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Chih-Kai Yang, Neo S. Ho, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.

Title: Adversarial Deep Metric Learning for Cross-Modal Audio-Text Alignment in Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting
Authors: Youngmoon Jung, Yong-Hyeok Lee, Myunghun Jung, Jaeyoung Roh, Chang Woo Han, Hoon-Young Cho
Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct extensive comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Active Speech Enhancement: Active Speech Denoising Decliping and Deveraberation
Authors: Ofir Yaish, Yehuda Mishaly, Eliya Nachmani
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.

Title: D3C2-Net: Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network for Compressive Sensing
Authors: Weiqi Li, Bin Chen, Shuai Liu, Shijie Zhao, Bowen Du, Yongbing Zhang, Jian Zhang
Abstract: By mapping iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks (NNs), deep unfolding networks (DUNs) exhibit well-defined and interpretable structures and achieve remarkable success in the field of compressive sensing (CS). However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability.

Title: The Barzilai-Borwein Method for Distributed Optimization over Unbalanced Directed Networks
Authors: Jinhui Hu, Xin Chen, Lifeng Zheng, Ling Zhang, Huaqing Li
Abstract: This paper studies optimization problems over multi-agent systems, in which all agents cooperatively minimize a global objective function expressed as a sum of local cost functions. Each agent in the systems uses only local computation and communication in the overall process without leaking their private information. Based on the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method and multi-consensus inner loops, a distributed algorithm with the availability of larger stepsizes and accelerated convergence, namely ADBB, is proposed. Moreover, owing to employing only row-stochastic weight matrices, ADBB can resolve the optimization problems over unbalanced directed networks without requiring the knowledge of neighbors' out-degree for each agent. Via establishing contraction relationships between the consensus error, the optimality gap, and the gradient tracking error, ADBB is theoretically proved to converge linearly to the globally optimal solution. A real-world data set is used in simulations to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.

Title: Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning
Authors: Iman Askari, Ali Vaziri, Xuemin Tu, Shen Zeng, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.

Title: Koopman Operators in Robot Learning
Authors: Lu Shi, Masih Haseli, Giorgos Mamakoukas, Daniel Bruder, Ian Abraham, Todd Murphey, Jorge Cortes, Konstantinos Karydis
Abstract: Koopman operator theory offers a rigorous treatment of dynamics and has been emerging as an alternative modeling and learning-based control method across various robotics sub-domains. Due to its ability to represent nonlinear dynamics as a linear (but higher-dimensional) operator, Koopman theory offers a fresh lens through which to understand and tackle the modeling and control of complex robotic systems. Moreover, it enables incremental updates and is computationally inexpensive, thus making it particularly appealing for real-time applications and online active learning. This review delves deeply into the foundations of Koopman operator theory and systematically builds a bridge from theoretical principles to practical robotic applications. We begin by explaining the mathematical underpinnings of the Koopman framework and discussing approximation approaches for incorporating inputs into Koopman-based modeling. Foundational considerations, such as data collection strategies as well as the design of lifting functions for effective system embedding, are also discussed. We then explore how Koopman-based models serve as a unifying tool for a range of robotics tasks, including model-based control, real-time state estimation, and motion planning. The review proceeds to a survey of cutting-edge research that demonstrates the versatility and growing impact of Koopman methods across diverse robotics sub-domains: from aerial and legged platforms to manipulators, soft-bodied systems, and multi-agent networks. A presentation of more advanced theoretical topics, necessary to push forward the overall framework, is included. Finally, we reflect on some key open challenges that remain and articulate future research directions that will shape the next phase of Koopman-inspired robotics. To support practical adoption, we provide a hands-on tutorial with executable code at this https URL.

Title: Enhancing Low-Resource Language and Instruction Following Capabilities of Audio Language Models
Authors: Potsawee Manakul, Guangzhi Sun, Warit Sirichotedumrong, Kasima Tharnpipitchai, Kunat Pipatanakul
Abstract: Audio language models process audio inputs using textual prompts for tasks like speech recognition and audio captioning. Although built on multilingual pre-trained components, most are trained primarily on English, limiting their usability for other languages. This paper evaluates audio language models on Thai, a low-resource language, and finds that they lack emergent cross-lingual abilities despite their multilingual foundations. To address this, we explore data mixtures that optimize audio language models for both a target language and English while integrating audio comprehension and speech instruction-following into a unified model. Our experiments provide insights into improving instruction-following in low-resource languages by balancing language-specific and multilingual training data. The proposed model, Typhoon-Audio, significantly outperforms existing open-source models and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai.

Title: NBM: an Open Dataset for the Acoustic Monitoring of Nocturnal Migratory Birds in Europe
Authors: Louis Airale, Adrien Pajot, Juliette Linossier
Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlight the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.

Title: Experimental Study of Low-Latency Video Streaming in an ORAN Setup with Generative AI
Authors: Andreas Casparsen, Van-Phuc Bui, Shashi Raj Pandey, Jimmy Jessen Nielsen, Petar Popovski
Abstract: Video streaming services depend on the underlying communication infrastructure and available network resources to offer ultra-low latency, high-quality content delivery. Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) provides a dynamic, programmable, and flexible RAN architecture that can be configured to support the requirements of time-critical applications. This work considers a setup in which the constrained network resources are supplemented by \gls{GAI} and \gls{MEC} {techniques} in order to reach a satisfactory video quality. Specifically, we implement a novel semantic control channel that enables \gls{MEC} to support low-latency applications by tight coupling among the ORAN xApp, \gls{MEC}, and the control channel. The proposed concepts are experimentally verified with an actual ORAN setup that supports video streaming. The performance evaluation includes the \gls{PSNR} metric and end-to-end latency. Our findings reveal that latency adjustments can yield gains in image \gls{PSNR}, underscoring the trade-off potential for optimized video quality in resource-limited environments.

Title: Does Your Voice Assistant Remember? Analyzing Conversational Context Recall and Utilization in Voice Interaction Models
Authors: Heeseung Kim, Che Hyun Lee, Sangkwon Park, Jiheum Yeom, Nohil Park, Sangwon Yu, Sungroh Yoon
Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-turn voice interaction models have improved user-model communication. However, while closed-source models effectively retain and recall past utterances, whether open-source models share this ability remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate how well open-source interaction models utilize past utterances using ContextDialog, a benchmark we proposed for this purpose. Our findings show that speech-based models have more difficulty than text-based ones, especially when recalling information conveyed in speech, and even with retrieval-augmented generation, models still struggle with questions about past utterances. These insights highlight key limitations in open-source models and suggest ways to improve memory retention and retrieval robustness.

Title: Open-Set Gait Recognition from Sparse mmWave Radar Point Clouds
Authors: Riccardo Mazzieri, Jacopo Pegoraro, Michele Rossi
Abstract: The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.

Title: CrossMuSim: A Cross-Modal Framework for Music Similarity Retrieval with LLM-Powered Text Description Sourcing and Mining
Authors: Tristan Tsoi, Jiajun Deng, Yaolong Ju, Benno Weck, Holger Kirchhoff, Simon Lui
Abstract: Music similarity retrieval is fundamental for managing and exploring relevant content from large collections in streaming platforms. This paper presents a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework that leverages the open-ended nature of text descriptions to guide music similarity modeling, addressing the limitations of traditional uni-modal approaches in capturing complex musical relationships. To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data, this paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach combining online scraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage LLMs' comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions. Exten1sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective metrics, subjective evaluations, and real-world A/B testing on the Huawei Music streaming platform.

Title: TimeCapsule: Solving the Jigsaw Puzzle of Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Compressed Predictive Representations
Authors: Yihang Lu, Yangyang Xu, Qitao Qing, Xianwei Meng
Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Efficient Chebyshev Reconstruction for the Anisotropic Equilibrium Model in Magnetic Particle Imaging
Authors: Christine Droigk, Daniel Hern√°ndez Dur√°n, Marco Maass, Tobias Knopp, Konrad Scheffler
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.

Title: Robust Nash equilibrium seeking based on semi-Markov switching topologies
Authors: Jianing Chen, Sitian Qin, Chuangyin Dang
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed robust Nash Equilibrium (NE) seeking problem in fluctuating environments. Specifically, the players, subject to the second-order dynamics, are considered to be influenced by external disturbances and uncertain dynamics while communicating via semi-Markov switching topologies. In such constantly changing network circumstances, the existence of disturbances and uncertain dynamics may directly affect the performance of most existing NE seeking algorithms. Moreover, the semi-Markov switching topologies may cause communication uncertainty, which are considered in NE seeking for the first time. To accommodate the above concerns, the following targets require to be reached simultaneously: (1) Disturbances and uncertain dynamics rejection in finite time; (2) Distributed estimation on unknown information required for players' cost functions; (3) A reasonable estimation consensus protocol under semi-Markov switching; (4) NE seeking for the second-order players. By combining supertwisting-based Integral Sliding-Mode Control (ISMC) with average consensus tracking, a novel robust NE seeking algorithm is constructed, incorporating an effective leader-follower consensus protocol. Furthermore, to lessen dispensable information transmission, a sampled-data-based event-triggered mechanism is introduced. Incorporating the advantages of both semi-Markov switching and event-triggered mechanism, another NE seeking algorithm is proposed. Through designing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the leader-follower consensus can be achieved in the mean-square sense under event-triggered mechanism. Finally, a connectivity control game is formulated to illustrate the validity of the designed algorithms.

Title: Model Identification Adaptive Control with $œÅ$-POMDP Planning
Authors: Michelle Ho, Arec Jamgochian, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Abstract: Accurate system modeling is crucial for safe, effective control, as misidentification can lead to accumulated errors, especially under partial observability. We address this problem by formulating informative input design and model identification adaptive control (MIAC) as belief space planning problems, modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes with belief-dependent rewards ($\rho$-POMDPs). We treat system parameters as hidden state variables that must be localized while simultaneously controlling the system. We solve this problem with an adapted belief-space iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (BiLQR). We demonstrate it on fully and partially observable tasks for cart-pole and steady aircraft flight domains. Our method outperforms baselines such as regression, filtering, and local optimal control methods, even under instantaneous disturbances to system parameters.

Title: EZ-VC: Easy Zero-shot Any-to-Any Voice Conversion
Authors: Advait Joglekar, Divyanshu Singh, Rooshil Rohit Bhatia, S. Umesh
Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings even for unseen languages.
