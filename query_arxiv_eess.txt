Title: A Deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network-based CAD system with Uncertainty Quantification for Medical Images Classification
Authors: Mohaddeseh Chegini, Ali Mahloojifar
Abstract: The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information. However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability. To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study, the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is accurate and reliable and will be a proper alternative to conventional deep learning for medical image classification.

Title: Quaternion Domain Super MDS for 3D Localization
Authors: Keigo Masuoka, Takumi Takahashi, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Hideki Ochiai
Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quaternion-domain super multidimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). This algorithm reformulates the conventional SMDS, which was originally developed in the real domain, into the quaternion domain. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method enables the construction of a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative distance and angular (phase) information between nodes, maximizing the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation via singular value decomposition (SVD). The simulation results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates a notable enhancement in localization accuracy relative to the conventional SMDS algorithm, particularly in scenarios characterized by substantial measurement errors.

Title: Material Identification Via RFID For Smart Shopping
Authors: David Wang, Derek Goh, Jiale Zhang
Abstract: Cashierless stores rely on computer vision and RFID tags to associate shoppers with items, but concealed items placed in backpacks, pockets, or bags create challenges for theft prevention. We introduce a system that turns existing RFID tagged items into material sensors by exploiting how different containers attenuate and scatter RF signals. Using RSSI and phase angle, we trained a neural network to classify seven common containers. In a simulated retail environment, the model achieves 89% accuracy with one second samples and 74% accuracy from single reads. Incorporating distance measurements, our system achieves 82% accuracy across 0.3-2m tag to reader separations. When deployed at aisle or doorway choke points, the system can flag suspicious events in real time, prompting camera screening or staff intervention. By combining material identification with computer vision tracking, our system provides proactive loss prevention for cashierless retail while utilizing existing infrastructure.

Title: Recursive Identification of Structured Systems: An Instrumental-Variable Approach Applied to Mechanical Systems
Authors: Koen Classens, Rodrigo A. Gonz√°lez, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Online system identification algorithms are widely used for monitoring, diagnostics and control by continuously adapting to time-varying dynamics. Typically, these algorithms consider a model structure that lacks parsimony and offers limited physical interpretability. The objective of this paper is to develop a real-time parameter estimation algorithm aimed at identifying time-varying dynamics within an interpretable model structure. An additive model structure is adopted for this purpose, which offers enhanced parsimony and is shown to be particularly suitable for mechanical systems. The proposed approach integrates the recursive simplified refined instrumental variable method with block-coordinate descent to minimize an exponentially-weighted output error cost function. This novel recursive identification method delivers parametric continuous-time additive models and is applicable in both open-loop and closed-loop controlled systems. Its efficacy is shown using numerical simulations and is further validated using experimental data to detect the time-varying resonance dynamics of a flexible beam system. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for online and interpretable estimation for advanced monitoring and control applications.

Title: Predicting Dairy Calf Body Weight from Depth Images Using Deep Learning (YOLOv8) and Threshold Segmentation with Cross-Validation and Longitudinal Analysis
Authors: Mingsi Liao, Gota Morota, Ye Bi, Rebecca R. Cockrum
Abstract: Monitoring calf body weight (BW) before weaning is essential for assessing growth, feed efficiency, health, and weaning readiness. However, labor, time, and facility constraints limit BW collection. Additionally, Holstein calf coat patterns complicate image-based BW estimation, and few studies have explored non-contact measurements taken at early time points for predicting later BW. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop deep learning-based segmentation models for extracting calf body metrics, (2) compare deep learning segmentation with threshold-based methods, and (3) evaluate BW prediction using single-time-point cross-validation with linear regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multiple-time-point cross-validation with LR, XGBoost, and a linear mixed model (LMM). Depth images from Holstein (n = 63) and Jersey (n = 5) pre-weaning calves were collected, with 20 Holstein calves being weighed manually. Results showed that You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) deep learning segmentation (intersection over union = 0.98) outperformed threshold-based methods (0.89). In single-time-point cross-validation, XGBoost achieved the best BW prediction (R^2 = 0.91, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 4.37%), while LMM provided the most accurate longitudinal BW prediction (R^2 = 0.99, MAPE = 2.39%). These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for automated BW prediction, enhancing farm management.

Title: Spectral Bias Correction in PINNs for Myocardial Image Registration of Pathological Data
Authors: Bastien C. Baluyot, Marta Varela, Chen Qin
Abstract: Accurate myocardial image registration is essential for cardiac strain analysis and disease diagnosis. However, spectral bias in neural networks impedes modeling high-frequency deformations, producing inaccurate, biomechanically implausible results, particularly in pathological data. This paper addresses spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by integrating Fourier Feature mappings and introducing modulation strategies into a PINN framework. Experiments on two distinct datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods enhance the PINN's ability to capture complex, high-frequency deformations in cardiomyopathies, achieving superior registration accuracy while maintaining biomechanical plausibility - thus providing a foundation for scalable cardiac image registration and generalization across multiple patients and pathologies.

Title: Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior
Authors: Liraz Mudrik, Sean Kragelund, Isaac Kaminer
Abstract: Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.

Title: Assessing the Utility of Audio Foundation Models for Heart and Respiratory Sound Analysis
Authors: Daisuke Niizumi, Daiki Takeuchi, Masahiro Yasuda, Binh Thien Nguyen, Yasunori Ohishi, Noboru Harada
Abstract: Pre-trained deep learning models, known as foundation models, have become essential building blocks in machine learning domains such as natural language processing and image domains. This trend has extended to respiratory and heart sound models, which have demonstrated effectiveness as off-the-shelf feature extractors. However, their evaluation benchmarking has been limited, resulting in incompatibility with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, thus hindering proof of their effectiveness. This study investigates the practical effectiveness of off-the-shelf audio foundation models by comparing their performance across four respiratory and heart sound tasks with SOTA fine-tuning results. Experiments show that models struggled on two tasks with noisy data but achieved SOTA performance on the other tasks with clean data. Moreover, general-purpose audio models outperformed a respiratory sound model, highlighting their broader applicability. With gained insights and the released code, we contribute to future research on developing and leveraging foundation models for respiratory and heart sounds.

Title: Optimal Power Allocation for OFDM-based Ranging Using Random Communication Signals
Authors: Ying Zhang, Fan Liu, Tao Liu, Shi Jin
Abstract: High-precision ranging plays a crucial role in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. To improve the ranging performance while maximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to reuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent randomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC system under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of both periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the ISAC signal. Towards that end, we first derive the closed-form expressions of the average squared P-ACF and A-ACF, and then propose to minimize the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under arbitrary constellation mapping. We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme achieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step further, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at every lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with frequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the ranging resolution. We reveal that there exists a tradeoff between sidelobe level and mainlobe width, and propose a project gradient descent algorithm to seek a locally optimal PA scheme that reduces the EISL. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed PA methods in reducing the ranging sidelobe level for random OFDM signals.

Title: Physics-Driven Neural Compensation For Electrical Impedance Tomography
Authors: Chuyu Wang, Huiting Deng, Dong Liu
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction, but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT, thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.

Title: Physical Layer Security for Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Survey
Authors: Toshiki Matsumine, Hideki Ochiai, Junji Shikata
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The integration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum and infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The introduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities related to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant research focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security (PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages embedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious sensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance and security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique opportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential eavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS methodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC. The study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS and sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the existing literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for ISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current state of research. The study concludes by outlining potential avenues for future research pertaining to secure ISAC systems.

Title: Full-Duplex ISCC for Low-Altitude Networks: Resource Allocation and Coordinated Beamforming
Authors: Yiyang Chen, Wenchao Liu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Huijun Xing, Shuqiang Wang, Yanyan Shen
Abstract: This paper investigates an integrated sensing, communication, and computing system deployed over low-altitude networks for enabling applications within the low-altitude economy. In the considered system, a full-duplex enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched in the airspace, functioning as a UAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ULAP). The ULAP is capable of achieving simultaneous information transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge computing services. To reduce the overall energy consumption of the system while meeting the sensing beampattern threshold and user computation requirements, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing the task allocation, computation resource allocation, transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. Since the problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternation optimization, which decomposes the original problem into tractable convex subproblems. Moreover, we analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme saves up to 54.12\% energy consumption performance compared to the benchmark schemes.

Title: Multiple Target Tracking Using a UAV Swarm in Maritime Environments
Authors: Andreas Anastasiou, Savvas Papaioannou, Panayiotis Kolios, Christos G. Panayiotou
Abstract: Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly utilized in search and rescue missions, a trend driven by technological advancements, including enhancements in automation, avionics, and the reduced cost of electronics. In this work, we introduce a collaborative model predictive control (MPC) framework aimed at addressing the joint problem of guidance and state estimation for tracking multiple castaway targets with a fleet of autonomous UAV agents. We assume that each UAV agent is equipped with a camera sensor, which has a limited sensing range and is utilized for receiving noisy observations from multiple moving castaways adrift in maritime conditions. We derive a nonlinear mixed integer programming (NMIP) -based controller that facilitates the guidance of the UAVs by generating non-myopic trajectories within a receding planning horizon. These trajectories are designed to minimize the tracking error across multiple targets by directing the UAV fleet to locations expected to yield targets measurements, thereby minimizing the uncertainty of the estimated target states. Extensive simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in tracking multiple castaways in maritime environments.

Title: DOSE : Drum One-Shot Extraction from Music Mixture
Authors: Suntae Hwang, Seonghyeon Kang, Kyungsu Kim, Semin Ahn, Kyogu Lee
Abstract: Drum one-shot samples are crucial for music production, particularly in sound design and electronic music. This paper introduces Drum One-Shot Extraction, a task in which the goal is to extract drum one-shots that are present in the music mixture. To facilitate this, we propose the Random Mixture One-shot Dataset (RMOD), comprising large-scale, randomly arranged music mixtures paired with corresponding drum one-shot samples. Our proposed model, Drum One- Shot Extractor (DOSE), leverages neural audio codec language models for end-to-end extraction, bypassing traditional source separation steps. Additionally, we introduce a novel onset loss, designed to encourage accurate prediction of the initial transient of drum one-shots, which is essential for capturing timbral characteristics. We compare this approach against a source separation-based extraction method as a baseline. The results, evaluated using Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and Multi-Scale Spectral loss (MSS), demonstrate that DOSE, enhanced with onset loss, outperforms the baseline, providing more accurate and higher-quality drum one-shots from music mixtures. The code, model checkpoint, and audio examples are available at this https URL

Title: Generative AI for Physical-Layer Authentication
Authors: Rui Meng, Xiqi Cheng, Song Gao, Xiaodong Xu, Chen Dong, Guoshun Nan, Xiaofeng Tao, Ping Zhang, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA), which focuses on achieving endogenous security and intelligent identity authentication, has attracted considerable interest. When compared with Discriminative AI (DAI), Generative AI (GAI) offers several advantages, such as fingerprint data augmentation, fingerprint denoising and reconstruction, and protection against adversarial attacks. Inspired by these innovations, this paper provides a systematic exploration of GAI's integration into PLA frameworks. We commence with a review of representative authentication techniques, emphasizing PLA's inherent strengths. Following this, we revisit four typical GAI models and contrast the limitations of DAI with the potential of GAI in addressing PLA challenges, including insufficient fingerprint data, environment noises and inferences, perturbations in fingerprint data, and complex tasks. Specifically, we delve into providing GAI-enhance methods for PLA across the data, model, and application layers in detail. Moreover, we present a case study that combines fingerprint extrapolation, generative diffusion models, and cooperative nodes to illustrate the superiority of GAI in bolstering the reliability of PLA compared to DAI. Additionally, we outline potential future research directions for GAI-based PLA.

Title: Time and Frequency Domain-based Anomaly Detection in Smart Meter Data for Distribution Network Studies
Authors: Petar Labura, Tomislav Antic, Tomislav Capuder
Abstract: The widespread integration of new technologies in low-voltage distribution networks on the consumer side creates the need for distribution system operators to perform advanced real-time calculations to estimate network conditions. In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution networks with a high share of smart meters.

Title: Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter For High-Density Salt and Pepper Noise Removal
Authors: Md Jahidul Islam
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel filter, the Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter (AWMRmF), designed for the effective removal of high-density salt and pepper noise (SPN). AWMRmF integrates a pixel weight function and adaptivity condition inspired by the Different Adaptive Modified Riesz Mean Filter (DAMRmF). In my simulations, I evaluated the performance of AWMRmF against established filters such as Adaptive Frequency Median Filter (AFMF), Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF), Adaptive Cesaro Mean Filter (ACmF), Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter (ARmF), and Improved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (IAWMF). The assessment was conducted on 26 typical test images, varying noise levels from 60% to 95%. The findings indicate that, in terms of both Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, AWMRmF outperformed other state-of-the-art filters. Furthermore, AWMRmF demonstrated superior performance in mean PSNR and SSIM results as well.

Title: Towards a deep learning approach for classifying treatment response in glioblastomas
Authors: Ana Matoso, Catarina Passarinho, Marta P. Loureiro, Jos√© Maria Moreira, Patr√≠cia Figueiredo, Rita G. Nunes
Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of glioma, having a 5-year survival rate of 6.9%. Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response, radiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to categorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical features: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep learning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work aimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO criteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and tested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction of input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model architectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The pipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96% was achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency Maps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast, Grad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions observed in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it effectively identified the tumor region. These results set a benchmark for future studies on glioblastoma treatment response assessment based on the RANO criteria while emphasizing the heterogeneity of factors that might play a role when assessing the tumor's response to treatment.

Title: Multi-Sensor Fusion of Active and Passive Measurements for Extended Object Tracking
Authors: Hong Zhu, Alexander Venus, Erik Leitinger, Klaus Witrisal
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and reliable positioning of a radio device carried by an agent, in scenarios where direct line-of-sight (LOS) radio links are obstructed by the agent. We propose a Bayesian estimation algorithm that integrates active measurements between the radio device and anchors with passive measurements in-between anchors reflecting off the agent. A geometry-based scattering measurement model is introduced for multi-sensor structures, and multiple object-related measurements are incorporated to formulate an extended object probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm, where the agent that blocks, scatters and attenuates radio signals is modeled as an extended object (EO). The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy during and after obstructed LOS conditions, outperforming the conventional PDA (which is based on the point-target-assumption) and methods relying solely on active measurements.

Title: Advanced Channel Decomposition Techniques in OTFS: A GSVD Approach for Multi-User Downlink
Authors: Omid Abbassi Aghd, Oussama Ben Haj Belkacem, Dou Hu, Jo√£o Guerreiro, Nuno Souto, Michal Szczachor, Rui Dinis
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-user downlink system for two users based on the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The design leverages the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of the channels between the base station and the two users, applying precoding and detection matrices based on the right and left singular vectors, respectively. We derive the analytical expressions for three scenarios and present the corresponding simulation results. These results demonstrate that, in terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed system outperforms the conventional multi-user OTFS system in two scenarios when using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers or precoder, both for perfect channel state information and for a scenario with channel estimation errors. In the third scenario, the design is equivalent to zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at the transmitter.

Title: Neural Incremental Input-to-State Stable Control Lyapunov Functions for Unknown Continuous-time Systems
Authors: Ahan Basu, Bhabani Shankar Dey, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on synthesizing a controller that guarantees an unknown continuous-time system to be incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this context, the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF) for the continuous-time system is introduced. Combined with the controller, the $\delta$-ISS-CLF guarantees that the system is incrementally stable. As the paper deals with unknown dynamical systems, the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF are parametrized using neural networks. The data set used to train the neural networks is generated from the state space of the system by proper sampling. Now, to give a formal guarantee that the controller makes the system incrementally stable, we develop a validity condition by having some Lipschitz continuity assumptions and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies: a scalar system with a non-affine, non-polynomial structure, a one-link manipulator system, a nonlinear Moore-Greitzer model of a jet engine, and a rotating rigid spacecraft model.

Title: Unifying Direct and Indirect Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Amir Modares, Niyousha Ghiasi, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper aims to learn safe controllers for uncertain discrete-time linear systems under disturbances while achieving the following two crucial goals: 1) integration of different sources of information (i.e., prior information in terms of physical knowledge and posterior information in terms of streaming data), and 2) unifying direct learning with indirect learning. These goals are achieved by representing a parametrized data-driven constrained matrix zonotope form of closed-loop systems that is conformant to prior knowledge. To this end, we first leverage collected data to characterize closed-loop systems by a matrix zonotope and then show that the explainability of these closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint, which refines the matrix zonotope obtained by data to a constrained matrix zonotope. The prior knowledge is further refined by conforming it to the set of models obtained from a novel zonotope-based system identifier. The source of data used for zonotope-based system identification can be different than the one used for closed-loop representation, allowing to perform transfer learning and online adaptation to new data. The parametrized closed-loop set of systems is then leveraged to directly learn a controller that robustly imposes safety on the closed-loop system. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming to impose safety through {\lambda}-contractivity. For polytope safe sets, a primal-dual optimization is developed to formalize a linear programming optimization that certifies the set inclusion. For zonotope safe sets, the constrained zonotope set of all next states is formed, and set inclusion is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of this constrained zonotope in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set.

Title: NUDF: Neural Unsigned Distance Fields for high resolution 3D medical image segmentation
Authors: Kristine S√∏rensen, Oscar Camara, Ole de Backer, Klaus Kofoed, Rasmus Paulsen
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is often considered as the task of labelling each pixel or voxel as being inside or outside a given anatomy. Processing the images at their original size and resolution often result in insuperable memory requirements, but downsampling the images leads to a loss of important details. Instead of aiming to represent a smooth and continuous surface in a binary voxel-grid, we propose to learn a Neural Unsigned Distance Field (NUDF) directly from the image. The small memory requirements of NUDF allow for high resolution processing, while the continuous nature of the distance field allows us to create high resolution 3D mesh models of shapes of any topology (i.e. open surfaces). We evaluate our method on the task of left atrial appendage (LAA) segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The LAA is a complex and highly variable shape, being thus difficult to represent with traditional segmentation methods using discrete labelmaps. With our proposed method, we are able to predict 3D mesh models that capture the details of the LAA and achieve accuracy in the order of the voxel spacing in the CT images.

Title: Renewable-Colocated Green Hydrogen Production: Optimal Scheduling and Profitability
Authors: Siying Li, Lang Tong, Timothy Mount, Kanchan Upadhyay, Harris Eisenhardt, Pradip Kumar
Abstract: We study the optimal green hydrogen production and energy market participation of a renewable-colocated hydrogen producer (RCHP) that utilizes onsite renewable generation for both hydrogen production and grid services. Under deterministic and stochastic profit-maximization frameworks, we analyze RCHP's multiple market participation models and derive closed-form optimal scheduling policies that dynamically allocate renewable energy to hydrogen production and electricity export to the wholesale market. Analytical characterizations of the RCHP's operating profit and the optimal sizing of renewable and electrolyzer capacities are obtained. We use real-time renewable production and electricity price data from three independent system operators to assess the impacts of hydrogen market prices, renewable generation, and electricity prices on RCHP's profitability.

Title: Energy Security and Resilience: Reviewing Concepts and Advancing Planning Perspectives for Transforming Integrated Energy Systems
Authors: Richard Schmitz, Franziska Flachsbarth, Leonie Sara Plaga, Martin Braun, Philipp H√§rtel
Abstract: Recent events, including the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and climate change impacts, have exposed the critical need to ensure energy security and resilience in energy systems. We review existing definitions and interrelations between energy security and resilience, conceptualising these terms in the context of energy system transformations. We introduce a classification of disturbances into shock events and slow burn processes to highlight key challenges to energy system resilience. Examples illustrate their distinct impacts on technical, economic, and environmental system performance over time. We compile relevant recourse options across resilience capacity levels and system planning horizons to address these challenges, emphasising actionable strategies for an increasingly integrated energy system. Finally, we propose policy recommendations to integrate shock events and slow burn processes into future energy system planning, enabling forward-looking decision-making and system design to analyse and mitigate potential disruptions.

Title: Partition Map-Based Fast Block Partitioning for VVC Inter Coding
Authors: Xinmin Feng, Zhuoyuan Li, Li Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu
Abstract: Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with nested multi-type tree (QT+MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains by providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive partition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity substantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based algorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our previous work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the characteristics of VVC inter coding, and thus improve the partition map by incorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural network that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition map. It consists of several special designs including stacked top-down and bottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and partitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold decision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity reduction and rate-distortion (RD) performance loss. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time saving with a 2.12% Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) under the random access configuration.

Title: Optimal Control for Network of Coupled Oscillators
Authors: Adnan Tahirovic
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear control framework for steering networks of coupled oscillators toward desired phase-locked configurations. Inspired by brain dynamics, where structured phase differences support cognitive functions, the focus is on achieving synchronization patterns beyond global coherence. The Kuramoto model, expressed in phase-difference coordinates, is used to describe the system dynamics. The control problem is formulated within the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework, enabling the design of feedback laws through state-dependent factorisation. The unconstrained control formulation serves as a principled starting point for developing more general approaches that incorporate coupling constraints and actuation limits. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust phase-locking in both heterogeneous and large-scale oscillator networks, highlighting its potential applications in neuroscience, robotics, and distributed systems.

Title: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography
Authors: Yui Lo, Yuqian Chen, Dongnan Liu, Leo Zekelman, Jarrett Rushmore, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Alexandra J. Golby, Fan Zhang, Weidong Cai, Lauren J. O'Donnell
Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.

Title: HepatoGEN: Generating Hepatobiliary Phase MRI with Perceptual and Adversarial Models
Authors: Jens Hooge, Gerard Sanroma-Guell, Faidra Stavropoulou, Alexander Ullmann, Gesine Knobloch, Mark Klemens, Carola Schmidt, Sabine Weckbach, Andreas Bolz
Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

Abstract: We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that excels in audio understanding, generation, and conversation. We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in this https URL.

Title: Nearly isotropic segmentation for medial temporal lobe subregions in multi-modality MRI
Authors: Yue Li, Pulkit Khandelwal, Long Xie, Laura E. M. Wisse, Nidhi Mundada, Christopher A. Brown, Emily McGrew, Amanda Denning, Sandhitsu R. Das, David A. Wolk, Paul A. Yushkevich
Abstract: Morphometry of medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in brain MRI is sensitive biomarker to Alzheimers Disease and other related conditions. While T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals. Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for neurodegeneration in T2w MRI.

Title: Boosting-Enabled Robust System Identification of Partially Observed LTI Systems Under Heavy-Tailed Noise
Authors: Vinay Kanakeri, Aritra Mitra
Abstract: We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general heavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or sub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that are required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we leverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification algorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise assumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity bounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular, we establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed failure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by requiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.

Title: Improved Dwell-times for Switched Nonlinear Systems using Memory Regression Extension
Authors: Muzaffar Qureshi, Tochukwu Elijah Ogri, Humberto Ramos, Wanjiku A. Makumi, Zachary I. Bell, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: This paper presents a switched systems approach for extending the dwell-time of an autonomous agent during GPS-denied operation by leveraging memory regressor extension (MRE) techniques. To maintain accurate trajectory tracking despite unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances, the agent periodically acquires access to GPS, allowing it to correct accumulated state estimation errors. The motivation for this work arises from the limitations of existing switched system approaches, where increasing estimation errors during GPS-denied intervals and overly conservative dwell-time conditions restrict the operational efficiency of the agent. By leveraging MRE techniques during GPS-available intervals, the developed method refines the estimates of unknown system parameters, thereby enabling longer and more reliable operation in GPS-denied environments. A Lyapunov-based switched-system stability analysis establishes that improved parameter estimates obtained through concurrent learning allow extended operation in GPS-denied intervals without compromising closed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating dwell-time extensions and enhanced trajectory tracking performance.

Title: A Taylor Series Approach to Correction of Input Errors in Gaussian Process Regression
Authors: Muzaffar Qureshi, Tochukwu Elijah Ogri, Zachary I. Bell, Wanjiku A. Makumi, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely recognized as powerful non-parametric models for regression and classification. Traditional GP frameworks predominantly operate under the assumption that the inputs are either accurately known or subject to zero-mean noise. However, several real-world applications such as mobile sensors have imperfect localization, leading to inputs with biased errors. These biases can typically be estimated through measurements collected over time using, for example, Kalman filters. To avoid recomputation of the entire GP model when better estimates of the inputs used in the training data become available, we introduce a technique for updating a trained GP model to incorporate updated estimates of the inputs. By leveraging the differentiability of the mean and covariance functions derived from the squared exponential kernel, a second-order correction algorithm is developed to update the trained GP models. Precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of kernels enable real-time refinement of the mean and covariance predictions. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated using two simulation studies, with error analyses revealing improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Title: Voltage Stability and Control of Electrical Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Power Electronic Converters
Authors: Dionysios Moutevelis
Abstract: Power systems are currently undergoing a rapid paradigm change in their operation. Centralised energy production is being replaced by a number of Distributed Generation (DG) units that are placed at different locations and voltage levels in power networks. These distributed units are mostly based on renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaic cells and are commonly interfaced to the grid via power electronic converters. These sources reduce energy system dependency on conventional generation units based on fossil fuels. At the same time, this shift introduces technical challenges for the safe and reliable operation of electricity network since DG sources do not inherently provide the grid regulation services of conventional, centralised generation units. Moreover, the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and their converter-based interfaces is creating voltage deviation and voltage stability issues in distribution networks. These issues range from overvoltages during hours of peak renewable generation, reverse power flows and sudden voltage drops due to the variable nature of renewable energy production. All of the above jeopardise the reliable operation of the distribution networks that were not originally designed to accommodate for these effects. The objective of this thesis is to propose novel techniques for the accurate assessment of the DG impact on voltage stability in distribution net works and investigate how the control capabilities of converter-based interfaces of DG units can be harnessed to improve stability margins and overall system robustness and performance.

Title: Music Tempo Estimation on Solo Instrumental Performance
Authors: Zhanhong He, Roberto Togneri, Xiangyu Zhang
Abstract: Recently, automatic music transcription has made it possible to convert musical audio into accurate MIDI. However, the resulting MIDI lacks music notations such as tempo, which hinders its conversion into sheet music. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art tempo estimation techniques and evaluate their performance on solo instrumental music. These include temporal convolutional network (TCN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) models that are pretrained on massive of mixed vocals and instrumental music, as well as TCN models trained specifically with solo instrumental performances. Through evaluations on drum, guitar, and classical piano datasets, our TCN models with the new training scheme achieved the best performance. Our newly trained TCN model increases the Acc1 metric by 38.6% for guitar tempo estimation, compared to the pretrained TCN model with an Acc1 of 61.1%. Although our trained TCN model is twice as accurate as the pretrained TCN model in estimating classical piano tempo, its Acc1 is only 50.9%. To improve the performance of deep learning models, we investigate their combinations with various post-processing methods. These post-processing techniques effectively enhance the performance of deep learning models when they struggle to estimate the tempo of specific instruments.

Abstract: Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers unique insights into cardiomyocyte arrangements, bridging the gap between microscopic and macroscopic cardiac function. However, its clinical utility is limited by technical challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, aliasing artefacts, and the need for accurate quantitative fidelity. To address these limitations, we introduce RSFR (Reconstruction, Segmentation, Fusion & Refinement), a novel framework for cardiac diffusion-weighted image reconstruction. RSFR employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, leveraging zero-shot semantic priors via the Segment Anything Model and a robust Vision Mamba-based reconstruction backbone. Our framework integrates semantic features effectively to mitigate artefacts and enhance fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and accurate DT parameter estimation under high undersampling rates. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance of RSFR compared to existing methods, highlighting its robustness, scalability, and potential for clinical translation in quantitative cardiac DTI.

Title: SmallGS: Gaussian Splatting-based Camera Pose Estimation for Small-Baseline Videos
Authors: Yuxin Yao, Yan Zhang, Zhening Huang, Joan Lasenby
Abstract: Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life, especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

Title: Object Learning and Robust 3D Reconstruction
Authors: Sara Sabour
Abstract: In this thesis we discuss architectural designs and training methods for a neural network to have the ability of dissecting an image into objects of interest without supervision. The main challenge in 2D unsupervised object segmentation is distinguishing between foreground objects of interest and background. FlowCapsules uses motion as a cue for the objects of interest in 2D scenarios. The last part of this thesis focuses on 3D applications where the goal is detecting and removal of the object of interest from the input images. In these tasks, we leverage the geometric consistency of scenes in 3D to detect the inconsistent dynamic objects. Our transient object masks are then used for designing robust optimization kernels to improve 3D modelling in a casual capture setup. One of our goals in this thesis is to show the merits of unsupervised object based approaches in computer vision. Furthermore, we suggest possible directions for defining objects of interest or foreground objects without requiring supervision. Our hope is to motivate and excite the community into further exploring explicit object representations in image understanding tasks.

Title: Subject-driven Video Generation via Disentangled Identity and Motion
Authors: Daneul Kim, Jingxu Zhang, Wonjoon Jin, Sunghyun Cho, Qi Dai, Jaesik Park, Chong Luo
Abstract: We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation. In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image customization dataset directly on training video customization models, factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method. Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Title: Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters
Authors: Eviatar Bach, Ricardo Baptista, Edoardo Calvello, Bohan Chen, Andrew Stuart
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state--observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a Measure Neural Mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-fieldlimit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.

Title: Terrain-Aware Kinodynamic Planning with Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices for Mobile Robot Navigation in Off-Road Environments
Authors: Eric R. Damm, Jason M. Gregory, Eli S. Lancaster, Felix A. Sanchez, Daniel M. Sahu, Thomas M. Howard
Abstract: To safely traverse non-flat terrain, robots must account for the influence of terrain shape in their planned motions. Terrain-aware motion planners use an estimate of the vehicle roll and pitch as a function of pose, vehicle suspension, and ground elevation map to weigh the cost of edges in the search space. Encoding such information in a traditional two-dimensional cost map is limiting because it is unable to capture the influence of orientation on the roll and pitch estimates from sloped terrain. The research presented herein addresses this problem by encoding kinodynamic information in the edges of a recombinant motion planning search space based on the Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (EASL). This approach, which we describe as a Kinodynamic Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL), differs from the prior representation in two ways. First, this method uses a novel encoding of velocity and acceleration constraints and vehicle direction at expanded nodes in the motion planning graph. Second, this approach describes additional steps for evaluating the roll, pitch, constraints, and velocities associated with poses along each edge during search in a manner that still enables the graph to remain recombinant. Velocities are computed using an iterative bidirectional method using Eulerian integration that more accurately estimates the duration of edges that are subject to terrain-dependent velocity limits. Real-world experiments on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle were performed in a non-flat, unstructured environment. Results from 2093 planning queries from these experiments showed that KEASL provided a more efficient route than EASL in 83.72% of cases when EASL plans were adjusted to satisfy terrain-dependent velocity constraints. An analysis of relative runtimes and differences between planned routes is additionally presented.

Title: STNet: Prediction of Underwater Sound Speed Profiles with An Advanced Semi-Transformer Neural Network
Authors: Wei Huang, Jiajun Lu, Hao Zhang, Tianhe Xu
Abstract: Real time acquisition of accurate underwater sound velocity profile (SSP) is crucial for tracking the propagation trajectory of underwater acoustic signals, making it play a key role in ocean communication positioning. SSPs can be directly measured by instruments or inverted leveraging sound field data. Although measurement techniques provide a good accuracy, they are constrained by limited spatial coverage and require substantial time investment. The inversion method based on real-time measurement of acoustic field data improves operational efficiency, but loses the accuracy of SSP estimation and suffers from limited spatial applicability due to its stringent requirements for ocean observation infrastructure. To achieve accurate long-term ocean SSP estimation independent of real-time underwater data measurements, we propose a Semi-Transformer neural network (STNet) specifically designed for simulating sound velocity distribution patterns from the perspective of time series prediction. The proposed network architecture incorporates an optimized self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies within historical sound velocity time-series data, facilitating accurate estimation of current SSPs or prediction of future SSPs. Through architectural optimization of the Transformer framework and integration of a time encoding mechanism, STNet could effectively improve computational efficiency. Comparative experimental results reveal that STNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and maintain good computational efficiency, demonstrating its potential for enabling accurate long-term full-depth ocean SSP forecasting.

Title: Masked strategies for images with small objects
Authors: H. Martin Gillis, Ming Hill, Paul Hollensen, Alan Fine, Thomas Trappenberg
Abstract: The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood components is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.

Title: Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems
Authors: Jinnan Piao, Dong Li, Yiming Sun, Zhibo Li, Ming Yang, Xueting Yu
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve the control and communication performance. In the algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoding. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information can reduce the block error rate performance of communications to improve the root mean square error performance of controls.

Title: Joint Resource Estimation and Trajectory Optimization for eVTOL-involved CR network: A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Approach
Authors: Kai Xiong, Chenxin Yang, Yujie Qin, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.

Title: Tracking Articulatory Dynamics in Speech with a Fixed-Weight BiLSTM-CNN Architecture
Authors: Leena G Pillai, D. Muhammad Noorul Mubarak, Elizabeth Sherly
Abstract: Speech production is a complex sequential process which involve the coordination of various articulatory features. Among them tongue being a highly versatile active articulator responsible for shaping airflow to produce targeted speech sounds that are intellectual, clear, and distinct. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features involved in a given speech acoustics using a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, combined with a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights initialization. The proposed network is trained with two datasets consisting of simultaneously recorded speech and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) datasets, each introducing variations in terms of geographical origin, linguistic characteristics, phonetic diversity, and recording equipment. The performance of the model is assessed in Speaker Dependent (SD), Speaker Independent (SI), corpus dependent (CD) and cross corpus (CC) modes. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with fixed weights approach outperformed the adaptive weights initialization with in relatively minimal number of training epochs. These findings contribute to the development of robust and efficient models for articulatory feature prediction, paving the way for advancements in speech production research and applications.

Title: Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Simplified Design for Uniform Service Quality
Authors: Wei Jiang, Hans Dieter Schotten
Abstract: In traditional cellular networks, users at the cell edge often suffer from poor quality of service (QoS) due to large distance-dependent path loss and severe inter-cell interference. While cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-out (MIMO) mitigates this issue by distributing access points (APs) to ensure uniform QoS, the deployment of numerous distributed APs and a fronthaul network incurs high infrastructure costs. To balance performance and cost efficiency, this article proposes a simplified design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) massive MIMO. The key idea is to reduce the number of APs, thus minimizing the scale of the fronthaul network. The antennas from the decommissioned APs are aggregated at a central base station (cBS), which also serves as the coordinator for distributed APs. We derive closed-form expressions for uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) for HCF, CF, and cellular massive MIMO under pilot contamination and correlated fading channels, considering the use of multi-antenna APs. Numerical results confirm that the hierarchical architecture achieves $95\%$-likely per-user SE comparable to CF, enhancing cell-edge user rates in cellular systems by over 100 times, while significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the fronthaul network in CF. We develop max-min fairness algorithms for joint power control of the cBS and APs in the downlink, and the users in the uplink. These algorithms not only boost fairness and system capacity but also dramatically lower transmission power, e.g., achieving over $70\%$ savings in uplink, particularly beneficial for battery-powered mobile devices.

Title: LEAM: A Prompt-only Large Language Model-enabled Antenna Modeling Method
Authors: Tao Wu, Kexue Fu, Qiang Hua, Xinxin Liu, Muhammad Ali Imran, Bo Liu
Abstract: Antenna modeling is a time-consuming and complex process, decreasing the speed of antenna analysis and design. In this paper, a large language model (LLM)- enabled antenna modeling method, called LEAM, is presented to address this challenge. LEAM enables automatic antenna model generation based on language descriptions via prompt input, images, descriptions from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple). The effectiveness of LEAM is demonstrated by three examples: a Vivaldi antenna generated from a complete user description, a slotted patch antenna generated from an incomplete user description and the operating frequency, and a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions scanned from the literature. For all the examples, correct antenna models are generated in a few minutes. The code can be accessed via this https URL.

Title: Seeing Soundscapes: Audio-Visual Generation and Separation from Soundscapes Using Audio-Visual Separator
Authors: Minjae Kang, Martim Brand√£o
Abstract: Recent audio-visual generative models have made substantial progress in generating images from audio. However, existing approaches focus on generating images from single-class audio and fail to generate images from mixed audio. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Generation and Separation model (AV-GAS) for generating images from soundscapes (mixed audio containing multiple classes). Our contribution is threefold: First, we propose a new challenge in the audio-visual generation task, which is to generate an image given a multi-class audio input, and we propose a method that solves this task using an audio-visual separator. Second, we introduce a new audio-visual separation task, which involves generating separate images for each class present in a mixed audio input. Lastly, we propose new evaluation metrics for the audio-visual generation task: Class Representation Score (CRS) and a modified R@K. Our model is trained and evaluated on the VGGSound dataset. We show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving 7% higher CRS and 4% higher R@2* in generating plausible images with mixed audio.

Title: Explainable AI for UAV Mobility Management: A Deep Q-Network Approach for Handover Minimization
Authors: Irshad A. Meer, Bruno H√∂rmann, Mustafa Ozger, Fabien Geyer, Alberto Viseras, Dominic Schupke, Cicek Cavdar
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks presents significant mobility management challenges, primarily due to frequent handovers caused by probabilistic line-of-sight conditions with multiple ground base stations (BSs). To tackle these challenges, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, particularly deep Q-networks (DQN), have been employed to optimize handover decisions dynamically. However, a major drawback of these learning-based approaches is their black-box nature, which limits interpretability in the decision-making process. This paper introduces an explainable AI (XAI) framework that incorporates Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to provide deeper insights into how various state parameters influence handover decisions in a DQN-based mobility management system. By quantifying the impact of key features such as reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), buffer status, and UAV position, our approach enhances the interpretability and reliability of RL-based handover solutions. To validate and compare our framework, we utilize real-world network performance data collected from UAV flight trials. Simulation results show that our method provides intuitive explanations for policy decisions, effectively bridging the gap between AI-driven models and human decision-makers.

Abstract: The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$-coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.

Title: Iterative Event-based Motion Segmentation by Variational Contrast Maximization
Authors: Ryo Yamaki, Shintaro Shiba, Guillermo Gallego, Yoshimitsu Aoki
Abstract: Event cameras provide rich signals that are suitable for motion estimation since they respond to changes in the scene. As any visual changes in the scene produce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions (i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object detection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation method, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion hypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the Contrast Maximization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully classifies event clusters both for public and self-recorded datasets, producing sharp, motion-compensated edge-like images. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on moving object detection benchmarks with an improvement of over 30%, and demonstrates its possibility of applying to more complex and noisy real-world scenes. We hope this work broadens the sensitivity of Contrast Maximization with respect to both motion parameters and input events, thus contributing to theoretical advancements in event-based motion segmentation estimation. this https URL

Title: Boxi: Design Decisions in the Context of Algorithmic Performance for Robotics
Authors: Jonas Frey, Turcan Tuna, Lanke Frank Tarimo Fu, Cedric Weibel, Katharine Patterson, Benjamin Krummenacher, Matthias M√ºller, Julian Nubert, Maurice Fallon, Cesar Cadena, Marco Hutter
Abstract: Achieving robust autonomy in mobile robots operating in complex and unstructured environments requires a multimodal sensor suite capable of capturing diverse and complementary information. However, designing such a sensor suite involves multiple critical design decisions, such as sensor selection, component placement, thermal and power limitations, compute requirements, networking, synchronization, and calibration. While the importance of these key aspects is widely recognized, they are often overlooked in academia or retained as proprietary knowledge within large corporations. To improve this situation, we present Boxi, a tightly integrated sensor payload that enables robust autonomy of robots in the wild. This paper discusses the impact of payload design decisions made to optimize algorithmic performance for downstream tasks, specifically focusing on state estimation and mapping. Boxi is equipped with a variety of sensors: two LiDARs, 10 RGB cameras including high-dynamic range, global shutter, and rolling shutter models, an RGB-D camera, 7 inertial measurement units (IMUs) of varying precision, and a dual antenna RTK GNSS system. Our analysis shows that time synchronization, calibration, and sensor modality have a crucial impact on the state estimation performance. We frame this analysis in the context of cost considerations and environment-specific challenges. We also present a mobile sensor suite `cookbook` to serve as a comprehensive guideline, highlighting generalizable key design considerations and lessons learned during the development of Boxi. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of Boxi being used in a variety of applications in real-world scenarios, contributing to robust autonomy. More details and code: this https URL

Title: Information Freshness in Dynamic Gossip Networks
Authors: Arunabh Srivastava, Thomas Jacob Maranzatto, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider a source that shares updates with a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. The network's topology switches between two arbitrary topologies, with switching governed by a two-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process. Information freshness is well-understood for static networks. This work evaluates the impact of time-varying connections on information freshness. In order to quantify the freshness of information, we use the version age of information metric. If the two networks have static long-term average version ages of $f_1(n)$ and $f_2(n)$ with $f_1(n) \ll f_2(n)$, then the version age of the varying-topologies network is related to $f_1(n)$, $f_2(n)$, and the transition rates in the CTMC. If the transition rates in the CTMC are faster than $f_1(n)$, the average version age of the varying-topologies network is $f_1(n)$. Further, we observe that the behavior of a vanishingly small fraction of nodes can severely impact the long-term average version age of a network in a negative way. This motivates the definition of a typical set of nodes in the network. We evaluate the impact of fast and slow CTMC transition rates on the typical set of nodes.

Title: E-VLC: A Real-World Dataset for Event-based Visible Light Communication And Localization
Authors: Shintaro Shiba, Quan Kong, Norimasa Kobori
Abstract: Optical communication using modulated LEDs (e.g., visible light communication) is an emerging application for event cameras, thanks to their high spatio-temporal resolutions. Event cameras can be used simply to decode the LED signals and also to localize the camera relative to the LED marker positions. However, there is no public dataset to benchmark the decoding and localization in various real-world settings. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first public dataset that consists of an event camera, a frame camera, and ground-truth poses that are precisely synchronized with hardware triggers. It provides various camera motions with various sensitivities in different scene brightness settings, both indoor and outdoor. Furthermore, we propose a novel method of localization that leverages the Contrast Maximization framework for motion estimation and compensation. The detailed analysis and experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LED-based localization with events over the conventional AR-marker--based one with frames, as well as the efficacy of the proposed method in localization. We hope that the proposed dataset serves as a future benchmark for both motion-related classical computer vision tasks and LED marker decoding tasks simultaneously, paving the way to broadening applications of event cameras on mobile devices. this https URL

Title: Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI
Authors: Anna Katariina Wisakanto, Joe Rogero, Avyay M. Casheekar, Richard Mallah
Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.

Title: Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems
Authors: MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often \textit{(i)} computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or \textit{(ii)} infeasible due the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of \textit{minimum destabilizing real perturbation} to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of mutlti-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less time.

Title: Sampled-Data Primal-Dual Gradient Dynamics in Model Predictive Control
Authors: Ryuta Moriyasu, Sho Kawaguchi, Kenji Kashima
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a versatile approach capable of accommodating diverse control requirements that holds significant promise for a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden, which is sometimes considered excessive even for linear systems. Recently, a rapid computation method that guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller has been proposed for linear MPCs. However, stability has been ensured under the assumption that the controller is a continuous-time system, leading to potential instability when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance, that was traded off in the original. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method, which can be executed in only 1 $\mu$s in a standard laptop, not only ensures stability with considering sampled-data implementation but also effectively enhances control performance.

Title: Line zonotopes: A tool for state estimation and fault diagnosis of unbounded and descriptor systems
Authors: Brenner S. Rego, Davide M. Raimondo, Guilherme V. Raffo
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). Unlike intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, constrained zonotopes (CZs) can directly incorporate linear static constraints on state variables - typical of descriptor systems - into their mathematical representation, leading to less conservative enclosures. However, for LDS that are unstable or not fully observable, a bounded representation cannot ensure a valid enclosure of the states over time. To address this limitation, we introduce line zonotopes, a new representation for unbounded sets that retains key properties of CZs, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while enabling the description of strips, hyperplanes, and the entire n-dimensional Euclidean space. This extension not only generalizes the use of CZs to unbounded settings but can also enhance set-based estimation and AFD in both stable and unstable scenarios. Additionally, we extend the AFD method for LDS from Rego et al. (2020) to operate over reachable tubes rather than solely on the reachable set at the final time of the considered horizon. This reduces conservatism in input separation and enables more accurate fault diagnosis based on the entire output sequence. The advantages of the proposed methods over existing CZ-based approaches are demonstrated through numerical examples.

Title: SafEDMD: A Koopman-based data-driven controller design framework for nonlinear dynamical systems
Authors: Robin Str√§sser, Manuel Schaller, Karl Worthmann, Julian Berberich, Frank Allg√∂wer
Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose SafEDMD, a novel stability- and certificate-oriented EDMD-based controller design framework. Our approach leverages a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion in order to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, we establish a controller design based on semi-definite programming with guaranteed stabilization of the underlying nonlinear system. As central ingredient, we derive proportional error bounds that vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing
Authors: Mohamed Camil Belhadjoudja, Mohamed Maghenem, Emmanuel Witrant, Christophe Prieur
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the perturbed Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state on a given spatial subdomain during certain time intervals, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining time intervals. We assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the equation's destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be unknown and possibly space dependent but bounded. As a result, adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the perturbation. In particular, we guarantee input-to-state stability (ISS) when an upperbound on the perturbation's size is known. Otherwise, only global uniform ultimate boundedness (GUUB) is guaranteed. In contrast, when the state is measured at every spatial point all the time (full state measurement), convergence to an arbitrarily-small neighborhood of the origin is guaranteed, even if the perturbation's maximal size is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results.

Title: Combining X-Vectors and Bayesian Batch Active Learning: Two-Stage Active Learning Pipeline for Speech Recognition
Authors: Ognjen Kundacina, Vladimir Vincan, Dragisa Miskovic
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel two-stage active learning (AL) pipeline for automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining unsupervised and supervised AL methods. The first stage utilizes unsupervised AL by using x-vectors clustering for diverse sample selection from unlabeled speech data, thus establishing a robust initial dataset for the subsequent supervised AL. The second stage incorporates a supervised AL strategy, with a batch AL method specifically developed for ASR, aimed at selecting diverse and informative batches of samples. Here, sample diversity is also achieved using x-vectors clustering, while the most informative samples are identified using a Bayesian AL method tailored for ASR with an adaptation of Monte Carlo dropout to approximate Bayesian inference. This approach enables precise uncertainty estimation, thereby enhancing ASR model training with significantly reduced data requirements. Our method has shown superior performance compared to competing methods on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and OOD test sets, demonstrating that strategic sample selection and innovative Bayesian modeling can substantially optimize both labeling effort and data utilization in deep learning-based ASR applications.

Title: Koopman Operator-Based Physics-Informed Dual Autoencoder Framework for CSI Prediction and Tracking in 5G/6G Networks
Authors: Anis Hamadouche, Mathini Sellathurai
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for Channel State Information (CSI) tracking and prediction, integrating Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAE) and learned Koopman operator to represent CSI as a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by exogenous contextual inputs. The proposed method enables real-time updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), ensuring enhanced reliability and responsiveness of communication systems in dynamic environments. The architecture consists of dual autoencoders: one for CSI and another for contextual information, coupled through a lifted state space where the Koopman operator captures the linear evolution of CSI dynamics. By combining Koopman operator theory, state space representation, and real-time CSI reconstruction, this work offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic CSI tracking. These findings highlight the potential of Physics-Informed Autoencoders to revolutionize communication systems by delivering accurate, real-time CSI predictions while maintaining stringent data privacy standards.

Title: Trade-offs in Reliability and Performance Using Selective Beamforming for Ultra-Massive MIMO
Authors: Anis Hamadouche, Mathini Sellathurai
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization challenges in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems, focusing on array selection and beamforming in dynamic and diverse operational contexts. We introduce a novel array selection criterion that incorporates antenna health information into the optimization process, distinguishing our approach from traditional methods. Our methodology employs dual proximal-gradient ascent to effectively tackle the constrained non-convex and non-smooth nature of sparse array selection problems. A central feature of our strategy is the implementation of proportional fairness among communication users, aligning with system resource limitations while ensuring minimum rate requirements for all users. This approach not only enhances system efficiency and responsiveness but also ensures equitable resource distribution. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in optimizing Ultra-Massive MIMO system performance, demonstrating their applicability in complex communication scenarios. Our findings reveal key trade-offs influenced by the sparsity promotion weight (\(\gamma\)). As \(\gamma\) increases, spectral efficiency (SE) and communication rate (Ri) decrease, while beamforming matrix density (BMD) reduces and antenna reliability (RL) significantly improves. These results highlight the critical balance between performance and reliability, essential for the practical deployment of Ultra-Massive MIMO systems. This work advances the field by providing innovative solutions and new insights into array selection and beamforming optimization, setting a foundation for future research in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems.

Title: On the role of the signature transform in nonlinear systems and data-driven control
Authors: Anna Scampicchio, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Classic control techniques typically rely on a model of the system's response to external inputs, which is difficult to obtain from first principles especially if the unknown dynamics are nonlinear. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting an approach based on the so-called signature transform, a tool that is still largely unexplored in data-driven control. We first show that the signature provides rigorous and practically effective features to represent and predict system trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a novel use of this tool on an output-matching problem, paving the way for signature-based, data-driven predictive control.

Title: Scanning Electron Microscopy-based Automatic Defect Inspection for Semiconductor Manufacturing: A Systematic Review
Authors: Enrique Dehaerne, Bappaditya Dey, Victor Blanco, Jesse Davis
Abstract: In this review, automatic defect inspection algorithms that analyze Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images for Semiconductor Manufacturing (SM) are identified, categorized, and discussed. This is a topic of critical importance for the SM industry as the continuous shrinking of device patterns has led to increasing defectivity and a greater prevalence of higher-resolution imaging tools such as SEM. Among others, these aspects threaten to increase costs due to increased inspection time-to-solution and decreased yield. Relevant research papers were systematically identified in four popular publication databases in January 2024. A total of 103 papers were selected after screening for novel contributions relating to automatic SEM image analysis algorithms for semiconductor defect inspection. These papers were then categorized based on the inspection tasks they addressed, their evaluation metrics, and the type of algorithms used. A notable finding from this categorization is that reference-based defect detection algorithms were the most popular algorithm type until 2020 when Deep Learning (DL)-based inspection algorithms became more popular, especially for defect classification. Furthermore, four broader research questions were discussed to come to the following conclusions: (i) the key components of inspection algorithms are set up, pre-processing, feature extraction, and final prediction; (ii) the maturity of the manufacturing process affects the data availability and required sensitivity of inspection algorithms; (iii) key challenges for these algorithms relate to the desiderata of minimizing time-to-solution which pushes for high imaging throughput, reducing manual input during algorithm setup, and higher processing throughput; and (iv) three promising directions for future work are suggested based on gaps in the reviewed literature that address key remaining limitations.

Title: Detection of Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Events Using Millimeter-wave Radar and Pulse Oximeter
Authors: Wei Wang, Chenyang Li, Zhaoxi Chen, Wenyu Zhang, Zetao Wang, Xi Guo, Jian Guan, Gang Li
Abstract: Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-related breathing disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The gold standard for OSAHS diagnosis, polysomnography (PSG), faces challenges in popularization due to its high cost and complexity. Recently, radar has shown potential in detecting sleep apnea-hypopnea events (SAE) with the advantages of low cost and non-contact monitoring. However, existing studies, especially those using deep learning, employ segment-based classification approach for SAE detection, making the task of event quantity estimation difficult. Additionally, radar-based SAE detection is susceptible to interference from body movements and the environment. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) can offer valuable information about OSAHS, but it also has certain limitations and cannot be used alone for diagnosis. In this study, we propose a method using millimeterwave radar and pulse oximeter to detect SAE, called ROSA. It fuses information from both sensors, and directly predicts the temporal localization of SAE. Experimental results demonstrate a high degree of consistency (ICC=0.9864) between AHI from ROSA and PSG. This study presents an effective method with lowload device for the diagnosis of OSAHS.

Title: SynthSoM: A synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)
Authors: Xiang Cheng, Ziwei Huang, Yong Yu, Lu Bai, Mingran Sun, Zengrui Han, Ruide Zhang, Sijiang Li
Abstract: Given the importance of datasets for sensing-communication integration research, a novel simulation platform for constructing communication and multi-modal sensory dataset is developed. The developed platform integrates three high-precision software, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Wireless InSite, and further achieves in-depth integration and precise alignment of them. Based on the developed platform, a new synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), named SynthSoM, is proposed. The SynthSoM dataset contains various air-ground multi-link cooperative scenarios with comprehensive conditions, including multiple weather conditions, times of the day, intelligent agent densities, frequency bands, and antenna types. The SynthSoM dataset encompasses multiple data modalities, including radio-frequency (RF) channel large-scale and small-scale fading data, RF millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory data, and non-RF sensory data, e.g., RGB images, depth maps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The quality of SynthSoM dataset is validated via statistics-based qualitative inspection and evaluation metrics through machine learning (ML) via real-world measurements. The SynthSoM dataset is open-sourced and provides consistent data for cross-comparing SoM-related algorithms.

Title: Distributed Multiple Testing with False Discovery Rate Control in the Presence of Byzantines
Authors: Daofu Zhang, Mehrdad Pournaderi, Yu Xiang, Pramod Varshney
Abstract: This work studies distributed multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control in the presence of Byzantine attacks, where an adversary captures a fraction of the nodes and corrupts their reported p-values. We focus on two baseline attack models: an oracle model with the full knowledge of which hypotheses are true nulls, and a practical attack model that leverages the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure locally to classify which p-values follow the true null hypotheses. We provide a thorough characterization of how both attack models affect the global FDR, which in turn motivates counter-attack strategies and stronger attack models. Our extensive simulation studies confirm the theoretical results, highlight key design trade-offs under attacks and countermeasures, and provide insights into more sophisticated attacks.

Abstract: ASVspoof 5 is the fifth edition in a series of challenges which promote the study of speech spoofing and deepfake attacks as well as the design of detection solutions. We introduce the ASVspoof 5 database which is generated in a crowdsourced fashion from data collected in diverse acoustic conditions (cf. studio-quality data for earlier ASVspoof databases) and from ~2,000 speakers (cf. ~100 earlier). The database contains attacks generated with 32 different algorithms, also crowdsourced, and optimised to varying degrees using new surrogate detection models. Among them are attacks generated with a mix of legacy and contemporary text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion models, in addition to adversarial attacks which are incorporated for the first time. ASVspoof 5 protocols comprise seven speaker-disjoint partitions. They include two distinct partitions for the training of different sets of attack models, two more for the development and evaluation of surrogate detection models, and then three additional partitions which comprise the ASVspoof 5 training, development and evaluation sets. An auxiliary set of data collected from an additional 30k speakers can also be used to train speaker encoders for the implementation of attack algorithms. Also described herein is an experimental validation of the new ASVspoof 5 database using a set of automatic speaker verification and spoof/deepfake baseline detectors. With the exception of protocols and tools for the generation of spoofed/deepfake speech, the resources described in this paper, already used by participants of the ASVspoof 5 challenge in 2024, are now all freely available to the community.

Title: Set-based and Dynamical Feedback-augmented Hands-off Control
Authors: Andrei SperilƒÉ, Sorin Olaru, St√©phane Drobot
Abstract: A novel set-theoretical approach to hands-off control is proposed, which focuses on spatial arguments for command limitation, rather than temporal ones. By employing dynamical feedback alongside invariant set-based constraints, actuation is employed only to drive the system's state inside a "hands-off region" of its state-space, where the plant may freely evolve in open-loop configuration. A computationally-efficient procedure with strong theoretical guarantees is devised, and its effectiveness is showcased via an intuitive practical example.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions
Authors: Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 24.14\%. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. This significantly strengthens system resilience, particularly in inertia-less power networks.

Title: Discrete Codebook Design for Self-interference Suppression in mmWave ISAC
Authors: Guang Chai, Zhibin Yu, Xiaofeng Wu, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference (SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem. Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem, whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.

Title: A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology
Authors: Hassan Keshvarikhojasteh, Mihail Tifrea, Sibylle Hess, Josien P.W. Pluim, Mitko Veta
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks. Our code is available at \href{this https URL}{\texttt{GABMIL}}.

Title: Multiple-Instance, Cascaded Classification for Keyword Spotting in Narrow-Band Audio
Authors: Ahmad AbdulKader, Kareem Nassar, Mohamed El-Geish, Daniel Galvez, Chetan Patil
Abstract: We propose using cascaded classifiers for a keyword spotting (KWS) task on narrow-band (NB), 8kHz audio acquired in non-IID environments -- a more challenging task than most state-of-the-art KWS systems face. We present a model that incorporates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), cascading, multiple-feature representations, and multiple-instance learning. The cascaded classifiers handle the task's class imbalance and reduce power consumption on computationally-constrained devices via early termination. The KWS system achieves a false negative rate of 6% at an hourly false positive rate of 0.75

Title: Deep Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation on SPD Manifolds
Authors: Ce Ju, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Recent progress in geometric deep learning has drawn increasing attention from the machine learning community toward domain adaptation on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, especially for neuroimaging data that often suffer from distribution shifts across sessions. These data, typically represented as covariance matrices of brain signals, inherently lie on SPD manifolds due to their symmetry and positive definiteness. However, conventional domain adaptation methods often overlook this geometric structure when applied directly to covariance matrices, which can result in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new geometric deep learning framework that combines optimal transport theory with the geometry of SPD manifolds. Our approach aligns data distributions while respecting the manifold structure, effectively reducing both marginal and conditional discrepancies. We validate our method on three cross-session brain computer interface datasets, KU, BNCI2014001, and BNCI2015001, where it consistently outperforms baseline approaches while maintaining the intrinsic geometry of the data. We also provide quantitative results and visualizations to better illustrate the behavior of the learned embeddings.

Title: A Dual Perspective of Reinforcement Learning for Imposing Policy Constraints
Authors: Bram De Cooman, Johan Suykens
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning methods lack an inherent mechanism to impose behavioural constraints on the trained policies. Although certain extensions exist, they remain limited to specific types of constraints, such as value constraints with additional reward signals or visitation density constraints. In this work we unify these existing techniques and bridge the gap with classical optimization and control theory, using a generic primal-dual framework for value-based and actor-critic reinforcement learning methods. The obtained dual formulations turn out to be especially useful for imposing additional constraints on the learned policy, as an intrinsic relationship between such dual constraints (or regularization terms) and reward modifications in the primal is revealed. Furthermore, using this framework, we are able to introduce some novel types of constraints, allowing to impose bounds on the policy's action density or on costs associated with transitions between consecutive states and actions. From the adjusted primal-dual optimization problems, a practical algorithm is derived that supports various combinations of policy constraints that are automatically handled throughout training using trainable reward modifications. The proposed $\texttt{DualCRL}$ method is examined in more detail and evaluated under different (combinations of) constraints on two interpretable environments. The results highlight the efficacy of the method, which ultimately provides the designer of such systems with a versatile toolbox of possible policy constraints.

Title: On the Loewner framework, the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, and the curse of dimensionality
Authors: Athanasios C. Antoulas, Ion Victor Gosea, Charles Poussot-Vassal
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach for the approximation of linear and nonlinear systems. The purpose here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is proposed. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a set of coupled Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric rational function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic reduction of the computational burden. Equally importantly, this burden is alleviated by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. Instead, the proposed methodology achieves decoupling of variables, leading to (i) a complexity reduction from $O(N^3)$ to below $O(N^{1.5})$ when $n > 5$ and (ii) to memory storage bounded by the largest variable dimension rather than their product, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. This decoupling of the variables leads to a result similar to the Kolmogorov superposition theorem for rational functions. Thus, making use of barycentric representations, every multivariate rational function can be computed using the composition and superposition of single-variable functions. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.

Title: Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics
Authors: Samie Mostafavi, Simon Egger, Gy√∂rgy D√°n, James Gross
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.

Title: Real-Time-Feasible Collision-Free Motion Planning For Ellipsoidal Objects
Authors: Yunfan Gao, Florian Messerer, Niels van Duijkeren, Boris Houska, Moritz Diehl
Abstract: Online planning of collision-free trajectories is a fundamental task for robotics and self-driving car applications. This paper revisits collision avoidance between ellipsoidal objects using differentiable constraints. Two ellipsoids do not overlap if and only if the endpoint of the vector between the center points of the ellipsoids does not lie in the interior of the Minkowski sum of the ellipsoids. This condition is formulated using a parametric over-approximation of the Minkowski sum, which can be made tight in any given direction. The resulting collision avoidance constraint is included in an optimal control problem (OCP) and evaluated in comparison to the separating-hyperplane approach. Not only do we observe that the Minkowski-sum formulation is computationally more efficient in our experiments, but also that using pre-determined over-approximation parameters based on warm-start trajectories leads to a very limited increase in suboptimality. This gives rise to a novel real-time scheme for collision-free motion planning with model predictive control (MPC). Both the real-time feasibility and the effectiveness of the constraint formulation are demonstrated in challenging real-world experiments.

Title: Whole-body End-Effector Pose Tracking
Authors: Tifanny Portela, Andrei Cramariuc, Mayank Mittal, Marco Hutter
Abstract: Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.

Title: Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Disentanglement for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications
Authors: Omar Erak, Omar Alhussein, Wen Tong
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and subpar performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the lack of reliable and reproducible methods to gain insight into the informativeness and minimality of the encoded feature vectors, we introduce a new technique to compute the information retention index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input, reflecting the minimality of the encoded features. The IRI quantifies the minimality and informativeness of the encoded feature vectors across different task-oriented communication techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI. CLAD achieves a predictive performance improvement of around 2.5-3%, along with a 77-90% reduction in IRI and a 57-76% decrease in adversarial attribute inference attack accuracy.

Title: Generative AI-Powered Plugin for Robust Federated Learning in Heterogeneous IoT Networks
Authors: Youngjoon Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization techniques that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. Key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.

Title: Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges
Authors: Milin Zhang, Mohammad Abdi, Venkat R. Dasari, Francesco Restuccia
Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.

Title: Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach
Authors: Petar Bevanda, Nicolas Hoischen, Tobias Wittmann, Jan Br√ºdigam, Sandra Hirche, Boris Houska
Abstract: This paper presents a novel operator-theoretic approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the infinitesimal generator of a controlled stochastic diffusion in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. We demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problems. Furthermore, our learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.

Title: An Adaptive Grasping Force Tracking Strategy for Nonlinear and Time-Varying Object Behaviors
Authors: Ziyang Cheng, Xiangyu Tian, Ruomin Sui, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang
Abstract: Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous, plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear, and time-varying grasp systems, demonstrating the generalization capability of our neural network and enhancing the robotic grasping ability in unstructured environments.

Title: EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing
Authors: Gaoxiang Cong, Jiadong Pan, Liang Li, Yuankai Qi, Yuxin Peng, Anton van den Hengel, Jian Yang, Qingming Huang
Abstract: Given a piece of text, a video clip, and a reference audio, the movie dubbing task aims to generate speech that aligns with the video while cloning the desired voice. The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences by efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker identity adapting module aims to decode acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

Title: A Temporal Convolutional Network-Based Approach and a Benchmark Dataset for Colonoscopy Video Temporal Segmentation
Authors: Carlo Biffi, Giorgio Roffo, Pietro Salvagnini, Andrea Cherubini
Abstract: Following recent advancements in computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems for colonoscopy, the automated reporting of colonoscopy procedures is set to further revolutionize clinical practice. A crucial yet underexplored aspect in the development of these systems is the creation of computer vision models capable of autonomously segmenting full-procedure colonoscopy videos into anatomical sections and procedural phases. In this work, we aim to create the first open-access dataset for this task and propose a state-of-the-art approach, benchmarked against competitive models. We annotated the publicly available REAL-Colon dataset, consisting of 2.7 million frames from 60 complete colonoscopy videos, with frame-level labels for anatomical locations and colonoscopy phases across nine categories. We then present ColonTCN, a learning-based architecture that employs custom temporal convolutional blocks designed to efficiently capture long temporal dependencies for the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy videos. We also propose a dual k-fold cross-validation evaluation protocol for this benchmark, which includes model assessment on unseen, multi-center this http URL achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy while maintaining a low parameter count when evaluated using the two proposed k-fold cross-validation settings, outperforming competitive models. We report ablation studies to provide insights into the challenges of this task and highlight the benefits of the custom temporal convolutional blocks, which enhance learning and improve model efficiency. We believe that the proposed open-access benchmark and the ColonTCN approach represent a significant advancement in the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy procedures, fostering further open-access research to address this clinical need.

Title: Learning Actionable World Models for Industrial Process Control
Authors: Peng Yan, Ahmed Abdulkadir, Gerrit A. Schatte, Giulia Aguzzi, Joonsu Gha, Nikola Pascher, Matthias Rosenthal, Yunlong Gao, Benjamin F. Grewe, Thilo Stadelmann
Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process inputs and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors influencing the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.

Title: Coverage-Guaranteed Speech Emotion Recognition via Calibrated Uncertainty-Adaptive Prediction Sets
Authors: Zijun Jia
Abstract: Road rage, driven by emotional outbursts, endangers road and public safety. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can detect early negative emotions to reduce accidents, but traditional methods (e.g., HMMs, LSTMs) using 1D speech signals face overfitting and miscalibration issues. This paper proposes a risk management framework ensuring statistically rigorous correctness coverage for test data. We separate a calibration set, design a binary loss function to check if ground-truth labels are in prediction sets, calibrated by data-driven threshold $\lambda$. A joint loss function on the calibration set adjusts $\lambda$ according to user-specified risk level $\alpha$, bounding the test loss expectation by $\alpha$. Evaluations on 6 models across 2 datasets show our framework strictly maintains average correctness coverage $\geq 1-\alpha$ and controls marginal error rates under various calibration-test splits (e.g., 0.1). Additionally, a small-batch online calibration framework based on local exchangeability is proposed for complex scenarios with data domain offset or non-IID batches. By constructing a non-negative test martingale, it ensures prediction set coverage in dynamic environments, validated via cross-dataset experiments.

Title: Spatial Audio Processing with Large Language Model on Wearable Devices
Authors: Ayushi Mishra, Yang Bai, Priyadarshan Narayanasamy, Nakul Garg, Nirupam Roy
Abstract: Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.

Title: Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion
Authors: Minjie Deng, Yan Wei, Hao Zhai, An Wu, Yuncan Ouyang, Qianyao Peng
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:
