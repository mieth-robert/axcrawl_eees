Title: Machine-learning competition to grade EEG background patterns in newborns with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
Authors: Fabio Magarelli, Geraldine B. Boylan, Saeed Montazeri, Feargal O'Sullivan, Dominic Lightbody, Minoo Ashoori, Tamara Skoric Ceranic, John M. O'Toole
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to support and improve expert performance in monitoring the brain function of at-risk newborns. Developing accurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated data, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by providing researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared learning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of crowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing 353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The data was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out validation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background patterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a machine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity of EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4 performing models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation dataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset, deep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had a significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing performance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen data, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with neonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on large and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's outcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML development to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the development of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring.

Title: Spectral Bottleneck in Deep Neural Networks: Noise is All You Need
Authors: Hemanth Chandravamsi, Dhanush V. Shenoy, Itay Zinn, Shimon Pisnoy, Steven H. Frankel
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a spectral learning bias, wherein low-frequency components are learned early in training, while high-frequency modes emerge more gradually in later epochs. However, when the target signal lacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies, training suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to reconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie within the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in the context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting high-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To effectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we propose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER - weight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network initialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian noise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide control over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the empirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral bottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and achieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal reconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.

Title: Target Defense Using a Turret and Mobile Defender Team
Authors: Alexander Von Moll, Dipankar Maity, Meir Pachter, Daigo Shishika, Michael Dorothy
Abstract: A scenario is considered wherein a stationary, turn constrained agent (Turret) and a mobile agent (Defender) cooperate to protect the former from an adversarial mobile agent (Attacker). The Attacker wishes to reach the Turret prior to getting captured by either the Defender or Turret, if possible. Meanwhile, the Defender and Turret seek to capture the Attacker as far from the Turret as possible. This scenario is formulated as a differential game and solved using a geometric approach. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the Turret-Defender team winning and the Attacker winning are given. In the case of the Turret-Defender team winning equilibrium strategies for the min max terminal distance of the Attacker to the Turret are given. Three cases arise corresponding to solo capture by the Defender, solo capture by the Turret, and capture simultaneously by both Turret and Defender.

Title: Automatic Regression for Governing Equations with Control (ARGOSc)
Authors: Amir Bahador Javadi, Amin Kargarian, Mort Naraghi-Pour
Abstract: Learning the governing equations of dynamical systems from data has drawn significant attention across diverse fields, including physics, engineering, robotics and control, economics, climate science, and healthcare. Sparse regression techniques, exemplified by the Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) framework, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting parsimonious models from time series data. However, real-world dynamical systems are driven by input control, external forces, or human interventions, which standard ARGOS does not accommodate. To address this, we introduce ARGOS with control (ARGOSc), an extension of ARGOS that incorporates external control inputs into the system identification process. ARGOSc extends the sparse regression framework to infer governing equations while accounting for the effects of exogenous inputs, enabling robust identification of forcing dynamics in low- to medium-noise datasets. We demonstrate ARGOSc efficacy on benchmark systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Lotka-Volterra, and the Lorenz system with forcing and feedback control, showing enhanced accuracy in discovering governing laws. Under the noisy conditions, ARGOSc outperforms the widely used sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDYc), in accurately identifying the underlying forced dynamics. In some cases, SINDYc fails to capture the true system dynamics, whereas ARGOSc consistently succeeds.

Title: High-Gain Voltage-Multiplier Coupled Quadratic Boost Converter: A New Design for Small Scale PV Integration
Authors: Safa Mohammed Sali, Hoach The Nguyen, Ameena Saad Al-Sumaiti
Abstract: This paper introduces a single-switch high-gain voltage-multiplier coupled quadratic boost converter (HGVM-QBC), developed from the conventional quadratic boost converter (QBC). The proposed topology is designed to achieve higher voltage gain, lower semiconductor voltage stress, and continuous current operation, making it particularly suitable for small-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems. By incorporating a voltage multiplier cell into the QBC, the converter significantly improves voltage boosting capability while mitigating stress on switching devices. In this configuration, the output voltage is obtained by combining the voltages across multiple output capacitors, thereby enhancing the overall voltage level. A detailed comparative study with recently reported converter topologies demonstrates the superior gain and reduced device stress offered by the HGVM-QBC. The design is validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, which confirm improved performance in terms of gain and voltage stress. Furthermore, an experimental prototype achieves an output of 151 Vdc from a 12 Vdc input at a 55% duty cycle, corresponding to a gain of 12.59. These results establish the HGVM-QBC as an efficient and reliable solution for PV applications that demand high voltage output from low input sources.

Title: The MSP-Podcast Corpus
Authors: Carlos Busso, Reza Lotfian, Kusha Sridhar, Ali N. Salman, Wei-Cheng Lin, Lucas Goncalves, Srinivas Parthasarathy, Abinay Reddy Naini, Seong-Gyun Leem, Luz Martinez-Lucas, Huang-Cheng Chou, Pravin Mote
Abstract: The availability of large, high-quality emotional speech databases is essential for advancing speech emotion recognition (SER) in real-world scenarios. However, many existing databases face limitations in size, emotional balance, and speaker diversity. This study describes the MSP-Podcast corpus, summarizing our ten-year effort. The corpus consists of over 400 hours of diverse audio samples from various audio-sharing websites, all of which have Common Licenses that permit the distribution of the corpus. We annotate the corpus with rich emotional labels, including primary (single dominant emotion) and secondary (multiple emotions perceived in the audio) emotional categories, as well as emotional attributes for valence, arousal, and dominance. At least five raters annotate these emotional labels. The corpus also has speaker identification for most samples, and human transcriptions of the lexical content of the sentences for the entire corpus. The data collection protocol includes a machine learning-driven pipeline for selecting emotionally diverse recordings, ensuring a balanced and varied representation of emotions across speakers and environments. The resulting database provides a comprehensive, high-quality resource, better suited for advancing SER systems in practical, real-world scenarios.

Title: EDMD-Based Robust Observer Synthesis for Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Xiuzhen Ye, Wentao Tang
Abstract: This paper presents a data driven Koopman operator based framework for designing robust state observers for nonlinear systems. Based on a finite dimensional surrogate of the Koopman generator, identified via an extended dynamic mode decomposition procedure, a tractable formulation of the observer design is enabled on the data driven model with conic uncertainties. The resulting problem is cast as a semidefinite program with linear matrix inequalities, guaranteeing exponential convergence of the observer with a predetermined rate in a probabilistic sense. The approach bridges the gap between statistical error tolerance and observer convergence certification, and enables an explicit use of linear systems theory for state observation via a data driven linear surrogate model. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method.

Title: Locally Permuted Low Rank Column-wise Sensing
Authors: Ahmed Ali Abbasi, Namrata Vaswani
Abstract: We precisely formulate, and provide a solution for, the Low Rank Columnwise Sensing (LRCS) problem when some of the observed data is scrambled/permuted/unlabeled. This problem, which we refer to as permuted LRCS, lies at the intersection of two distinct topics of recent research: unlabeled sensing and low rank column-wise (matrix) sensing. We introduce a novel generalization of the recently developed Alternating Gradient Descent and Minimization (AltGDMin) algorithm to solve this problem. We also develop an alternating minimization (AltMin) solution. We show, using simulation experiments, that both converge but PermutedAltGDmin is much faster than Permuted-AltMin.

Title: Real-Time Remote Tracking with State-Dependent Detection Probability: A POMDP Framework
Authors: Jiapei Tian, Abolfazl Zakeri, Marian Codreanu, David Gundlegård
Abstract: We consider a real-time tracking system where a binary Markov source is monitored by two heterogeneous sensors. Upon command, sensors send their observations to a remote sink over error-prone channels. We assume each sensor exhibits state-dependent detection accuracy and may occasionally fail to detect the source state. At most one sensor is scheduled for sampling at each time slot. We assess the effectiveness of data communication using a generic distortion function that captures the end application's objective. We derive optimal sink-side command policies to minimize the weighted sum of distortion and transmission costs. To model the uncertainty introduced by sensing failures (of the sensors) and packet loss, we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which we then cast into a belief-MDP. Since the belief evolves continuously, the belief space is discretized into a finite grid and the belief value is quantized to the nearest grid point after each update. This formulation leads to a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and highlights the importance of accounting for state-dependent sensing reliability in sensor scheduling.

Title: Field evaluation of a wearable instrumented headband designed for measuring head kinematics
Authors: Anu Tripathi, Yang Wan, Zhiren Zhu, Furkan Camci, Sheila Turcsanyi, Jeneel Pravin Kachhadiya, Mauricio Araiza Canizales, Alison Brooks, Haneesh Kesari, Joseph Andrews, Traci Snedden, Peter Ferrazzano, Christian Franck, Rika Wright Carlsen
Abstract: Purpose: To study the relationship between soccer heading and the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we previously developed an instrumented headband and data processing scheme to measure the angular head kinematics of soccer headers. Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic test device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball impacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in measuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The headband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins, goal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and peak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented mouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in the field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the headband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest agreement for angular velocities (0.79 \pm 0.08) and translational accelerations (0.73 \pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \pm 0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and mouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading) for the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1% for the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the instrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some kinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving the headband performance across all kinematic measures.

Title: Off Policy Lyapunov Stability in Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Sarvan Gill, Daniela Constantinescu
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the control policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This paper introduces a method for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and incorporates the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to provide them with a data efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted pendulum and a quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms when endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.

Title: Automated Tuning for Diffusion Inverse Problem Solvers without Generative Prior Retraining
Authors: Yaşar Utku Alçalar, Junno Yun, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Diffusion/score-based models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction. While their flexibility allows decoupling the measurement model from the learned prior, their performance heavily depends on carefully tuned data fidelity weights, especially under fast sampling schedules with few denoising steps. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which fail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep schedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling (ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights across arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion prior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and optimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled measurements. Experiments on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate that ZADS consistently outperforms both traditional compressed sensing and recent diffusion-based methods, showcasing its ability to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions across varying noise schedules and acquisition settings.

Title: Accelerating 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography with End-to-End Physics-Aware Neural Operators
Authors: Jiayun Wang, Yousuf Aborahama, Arya Khokhar, Yang Zhang, Chuwei Wang, Karteekeya Sastry, Julius Berner, Yilin Luo, Boris Bonev, Zongyi Li, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Lihong V. Wang, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) combines optical contrast with ultrasonic resolution, achieving deep-tissue imaging beyond the optical diffusion limit. While three-dimensional PACT systems enable high-resolution volumetric imaging for applications spanning transcranial to breast imaging, current implementations require dense transducer arrays and prolonged acquisition times, limiting clinical translation. We introduce Pano (PACT imaging neural operator), an end-to-end physics-aware model that directly learns the inverse acoustic mapping from sensor measurements to volumetric reconstructions. Unlike existing approaches (e.g. universal back-projection algorithm), Pano learns both physics and data priors while also being agnostic to the input data resolution. Pano employs spherical discrete-continuous convolutions to preserve hemispherical sensor geometry, incorporates Helmholtz equation constraints to ensure physical consistency and operates resolutionindependently across varying sensor configurations. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of Pano in reconstructing high-quality images from both simulated and real experimental data, achieving consistent performance even with significantly reduced transducer counts and limited-angle acquisition configurations. The framework maintains reconstruction fidelity across diverse sparse sampling patterns while enabling real-time volumetric imaging capabilities. This advancement establishes a practical pathway for making 3D PACT more accessible and feasible for both preclinical research and clinical applications, substantially reducing hardware requirements without compromising image reconstruction quality.

Title: Acoustic Scene Classification Using CNN-GRU Model Without Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Ee-Leng Tan, Jun Wei Yeow, Santi Peksi, Haowen Li, Ziyi Yang, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: In this technical report, we present the SNTL-NTU team's Task 1 submission for the Low-Complexity Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025 challenge. This submission departs from the typical application of knowledge distillation from a teacher to a student model, aiming to achieve high performance with limited complexity. The proposed model is based on a CNN-GRU model and is trained solely using the TAU Urban Acoustic Scene 2022 Mobile development dataset, without utilizing any external datasets, except for MicIRP, which is used for device impulse response (DIR) augmentation. The proposed model has a memory usage of 114.2KB and requires 10.9M muliply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. Using the development dataset, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 60.25%.

Title: Effective Modeling of Critical Contextual Information for TDNN-based Speaker Verification
Authors: Shilong Weng, Liu Yang, Ji Mao
Abstract: Today, Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) has become the mainstream architecture for speaker verification task, in which the ECAPA-TDNN is one of the state-of-the-art models. The current works that focus on improving TDNN primarily address the limitations of TDNN in modeling global information and bridge the gap between TDNN and 2-Dimensional convolutions. However, the hierarchical convolutional structure in the SE-Res2Block proposed by ECAPA-TDNN cannot make full use of the contextual information, resulting in the weak ability of ECAPA-TDNN to model effective context dependencies. To this end, three improved architectures based on ECAPA-TDNN are proposed to fully and effectively extract multi-scale features with context dependence and then aggregate these features. The experimental results on VoxCeleb and CN-Celeb verify the effectiveness of the three proposed architectures. One of these architectures achieves nearly a 23% lower Equal Error Rate compared to that of ECAPA-TDNN on VoxCeleb1-O dataset, demonstrating the competitive performance achievable among the current TDNN architectures under the comparable parameter count.

Title: Leveraging Predictions in Power System Voltage Control: An Adaptive Approach
Authors: Wenqi Cui, Yiheng Xie, Steven Low, Adam Wierman, Baosen Zhang
Abstract: High variability of solar PV and sudden changes in load (e.g., electric vehicles and storage) can lead to large voltage fluctuations in the distribution system. In recent years, a number of controllers have been designed to optimize voltage control. These controllers, however, almost always assume that the net load in the system remains constant over a sufficiently long time, such that the control actions converge before the load changes again. Given the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable resources, it is becoming important to explicitly consider net load that is time-varying. This paper proposes an adaptive approach to voltage control in power systems with significant time-varying net load. We leverage advances in short-term load forecasting, where the net load in the system can be partially predicted using local measurements. We integrate these predictions into the design of adaptive controllers, and prove that the overall control architecture achieves input-to-state stability in a decentralized manner. We optimize the control policy through reinforcement learning. Case studies are conducted using time-varying load data from a real-world distribution system.

Title: Drone-Based Multispectral Imaging and Deep Learning for Timely Detection of Branched Broomrape in Tomato Farms
Authors: Mohammadreza Narimani, Alireza Pourreza, Ali Moghimi, Mohsen Mesgaran, Parastoo Farajpoor, Hamid Jafarbiglu
Abstract: This study addresses the escalating threat of branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) to California's tomato industry, which supplies over 90 percent of U.S. processing tomatoes. The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early detection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly, environmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined drone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested tomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages determined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to isolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with 79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating later stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved detection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all growth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy and 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of temporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape detection. While further real-world data collection is needed for practical deployment, this study shows that UAV-based multispectral sensing coupled with deep learning could provide a powerful precision agriculture tool to reduce losses and improve sustainability in tomato production.

Title: Whisper Has an Internal Word Aligner
Authors: Sung-Lin Yeh, Yen Meng, Hao Tang
Abstract: There is an increasing interest in obtaining accurate word-level timestamps from strong automatic speech recognizers, in particular Whisper. Existing approaches either require additional training or are simply not competitive. The evaluation in prior work is also relatively loose, typically using a tolerance of more than 200 ms. In this work, we discover attention heads in Whisper that capture accurate word alignments and are distinctively different from those that do not. Moreover, we find that using characters produces finer and more accurate alignments than using wordpieces. Based on these findings, we propose an unsupervised approach to extracting word alignments by filtering attention heads while teacher forcing Whisper with characters. Our approach not only does not require training but also produces word alignments that are more accurate than prior work under a stricter tolerance between 20 ms and 100 ms.

Title: Ruggedized Ultrasound Sensing in Harsh Conditions: eRTIS in the wild
Authors: Dennis Laurijssen, Wouter Jansen, Arne Aerts, Walter Daems, Jan Steckel
Abstract: We present eRTIS, a rugged, embedded ultrasound sensing system for use in harsh industrial environments. The system features a broadband capacitive transducer and a 32-element MEMS microphone array capable of 2D and 3D beamforming. A modular hardware architecture separates sensing and processing tasks: a high-performance microcontroller handles excitation signal generation and data acquisition, while an NVIDIA Jetson module performs GPU-accelerated signal processing. eRTIS supports external synchronization via a custom controller that powers and coordinates up to six devices, either simultaneously or in a defined sequence. Additional synchronization options include bidirectional triggering and in-band signal injection. A sealed, anodized aluminum enclosure with passive cooling and IP-rated connectors ensures reliability in challenging conditions. Performance is demonstrated in three field scenarios: harbor mooring, off-road robotics, and autonomous navigation in cluttered environments, demonstrates that eRTIS provides robust sensing in situations where optical systems degrade.

Title: Unified Learnable 2D Convolutional Feature Extraction for ASR
Authors: Peter Vieting, Benedikt Hilmes, Ralf Schlüter, Hermann Ney
Abstract: Neural front-ends represent a promising approach to feature extraction for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems as they enable to learn specifically tailored features for different tasks. Yet, many of the existing techniques remain heavily influenced by classical methods. While this inductive bias may ease the system design, our work aims to develop a more generic front-end for feature extraction. Furthermore, we seek to unify the front-end architecture contrasting with existing approaches that apply a composition of several layer topologies originating from different sources. The experiments systematically show how to reduce the influence of existing techniques to achieve a generic front-end. The resulting 2D convolutional front-end is parameter-efficient and suitable for a scenario with limited computational resources unlike large models pre-trained on unlabeled audio. The results demonstrate that this generic unified approach is not only feasible but also matches the performance of existing supervised learnable feature extractors.

Title: Understanding the Geometry of Faulted Power Systems under High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources via Ellipse Fitting and Geometric Algebra
Authors: Jorge Ventura, Jaroslav Hrdina, Aleš Návrat, Marek Stodola, Ahmad Eid, Santiago Sanchez-Acevedo, Francisco G. Montoya
Abstract: Power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) present significant challenges for conventional protection schemes, with traditional distance protection methods failing to detect line-to-line faults during asymmetric conditions. This paper presents a methodology for electrical fault detection and classification using ellipse fitting and geometric algebra applied to voltage and current space curves. The approach characterizes electrical faults by fitting ellipses to voltage vector data, enabling fault detection with only a quarter-cycle. The method employs bivector components for line-to-ground fault classification, while ellipse parameters identify line-to-line and three-phase faults. The geometric representation preserves voltage or current curve shapes in three-dimensional space, overcoming Clarke transform limitations when zero-sequence components are present. Validation using simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates accurate fault identification and magnitude estimation, providing enhanced power system protection capabilities.

Title: Data-driven optimization of sparse sensor placement in thermal hydraulic experiments
Authors: Xicheng Wang, Yun. Feng, Dmitry Grishchenko, Pavel Kudinov, Ruifeng Tian, Sichao Tan
Abstract: Thermal-Hydraulic (TH) experiments provide valuable insight into the physics of heat and mass transfer and qualified data for code development, calibration and validation. However, measurements are typically collected from sparsely distributed sensors, offering limited coverage over the domain of interest and phenomena of interest. Determination of the spatial configuration of these sensors is crucial and challenging during the pre-test design stage. This paper develops a data-driven framework for optimizing sensor placement in TH experiments, including (i) a sensitivity analysis to construct datasets, (ii) Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for dimensionality reduction, and (iii) QR factorization with column pivoting to determine optimal sensor configuration under spatial constraints. The framework is demonstrated on a test conducted in the TALL-3D Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) loop. In this case, the utilization of optical techniques, such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), are impractical. Thereby the quantification of momentum and energy transport relies heavily on readings from Thermocouples (TCs). The test section was previously instrumented with many TCs determined through a manual process combining simulation results with expert judgement. The proposed framework provides a systematic and automated approach for sensor placement. The resulting TCs exhibit high sensitivity to the variation of uncertain input parameters and enable accurate full field reconstruction while maintaining robustness against measurement noise.

Title: Uplink RSMA for Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Apostolos A. Tegos, Yue Xiao, Sotiris A. Tegos, George K. Karagiannidis, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis
Abstract: One of the key goals of next-generation wireless networks is to adapt to changing conditions and meet the growing demand for reliable, high-capacity communications from emerging applications. Overcoming the limitations of conventional technologies, such as fixed antenna positions, is essential to achieving this objective because it mitigates the impact of path loss on the received signal and creates strong line-of-sight links, enhancing system performance. With this in mind, the newly proposed pinching antenna systems (PASs) are a promising solution for indoor applications because they can activate antennas across a waveguide deployed in a room, thus reducing the distance between the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we investigate a two-user, two-pinching-antenna uplink PAS, in which the transmitters use rate splitting to create a more resilient framework than non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For this network, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the outage probability. Numerical results validate these expressions, proving that the proposed rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme outperforms NOMA PAS.

Title: FetalSleepNet: A Transfer Learning Framework with Spectral Equalisation Domain Adaptation for Fetal Sleep Stage Classification
Authors: Weitao Tang, Johann Vargas-Calixto, Nasim Katebi, Nhi Tran, Sharmony B. Kelly, Gari D. Clifford, Robert Galinsky, Faezeh Marzbanrad
Abstract: Introduction: This study presents FetalSleepNet, the first published deep learning approach to classifying sleep states from the ovine electroencephalogram (EEG). Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth restriction). Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch. Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming baseline models. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data. FetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low power, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.

Title: Towards Data Drift Monitoring for Speech Deepfake Detection in the context of MLOps
Authors: Xin Wang, Wanying Ge, Junichi Yamagishi
Abstract: When being delivered in applications or services on the cloud, static speech deepfake detectors that are not updated will become vulnerable to newly created speech deepfake attacks. From the perspective of machine learning operations (MLOps), this paper tries to answer whether we can monitor new and unseen speech deepfake data that drifts away from a seen reference data set. We further ask, if drift is detected, whether we can fine-tune the detector using similarly drifted data, reduce the drift, and improve the detection performance. On a toy dataset and the large-scale MLAAD dataset, we show that the drift caused by new text-to-speech (TTS) attacks can be monitored using distances between the distributions of the new data and reference data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the detector using data generated by the new TTS deepfakes can reduce the drift and the detection error rates.

Title: Resilient Vital Sign Monitoring Using RIS-Assisted Radar
Authors: Christian Eckrich, Abdelhak M. Zoubir, Vahid Jamali
Abstract: Vital sign monitoring plays a critical role in healthcare and well-being, as parameters such as respiration and heart rate offer valuable insights into an individual's physiological state. While wearable devices allow for continuous measurement, their use in settings like in-home elderly care is often hindered by discomfort or user noncompliance. As a result, contactless solutions based on radar sensing have garnered increasing attention. This is due to their unobtrusive design and preservation of privacy advantages compared to camera-based systems. However, a single radar perspective can fail to capture breathing-induced chest movements reliably, particularly when the subject's orientation is unfavorable. To address this limitation, we integrate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that provides an additional sensing path, thereby enhancing the robustness of respiratory monitoring. We present a novel model for multi-path vital sign sensing that leverages both the direct radar path and an RIS-reflected path. We further discuss the potential benefits and improved performance our approach offers in continuous, privacy-preserving vital sign monitoring.

Title: Polarization Denoising and Demosaicking: Dataset and Baseline Method
Authors: Muhamad Daniel Ariff Bin Abdul Rahman, Yusuke Monno, Masayuki Tanaka, Masatoshi Okutomi
Abstract: A division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarimeter enables us to acquire images with multiple polarization orientations in one shot and thus it is valuable for many applications using polarimetric information. The image processing pipeline for a DoFP polarimeter entails two crucial tasks: denoising and demosaicking. While polarization demosaicking for a noise-free case has increasingly been studied, the research for the joint task of polarization denoising and demosaicking is scarce due to the lack of a suitable evaluation dataset and a solid baseline method. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset and method for polarization denoising and demosaicking. Our dataset contains 40 real-world scenes and three noise-level conditions, consisting of pairs of noisy mosaic inputs and noise-free full images. Our method takes a denoising-then-demosaicking approach based on well-accepted signal processing components to offer a reproducible method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits higher image reconstruction performance than other alternative methods, offering a solid baseline.

Title: Scalable Synthesis and Verification of String Stable Neural Certificates for Interconnected Systems

Abstract: Ensuring string stability is critical for the safety and efficiency of large-scale interconnected systems. Although learning-based controllers (e.g., those based on reinforcement learning) have demonstrated strong performance in complex control scenarios, their black-box nature hinders formal guarantees of string stability. To address this gap, we propose a novel verification and synthesis framework that integrates discrete-time scalable input-to-state stability (sISS) with neural network verification to formally guarantee string stability in interconnected systems. Our contributions are four-fold. First, we establish a formal framework for synthesizing and robustly verifying discrete-time scalable input-to-state stability (sISS) certificates for neural network-based interconnected systems. Specifically, our approach extends the notion of sISS to discrete-time settings, constructs neural sISS certificates, and introduces a verification procedure that ensures string stability while explicitly accounting for discrepancies between the true dynamics and their neural approximations. Second, we establish theoretical foundations and algorithms to scale the training and verification pipeline to large-scale interconnected systems. Third, we extend the framework to handle systems with external control inputs, thereby allowing the joint synthesis and verification of neural certificates and controllers. Fourth, we validate our approach in scenarios of mixed-autonomy platoons, drone formations, and microgrids. Numerical simulations show that the proposed framework not only guarantees sISS with minimal degradation in control performance but also efficiently trains and verifies controllers for large-scale interconnected systems under specific practical conditions.

Title: Soft Tissue Simulation and Force Estimation from Heterogeneous Structures using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Madina Kojanazarova, Sidady El Hadramy, Jack Wilkie, Georg Rauter, Philippe C. Cattin
Abstract: Accurately simulating soft tissue deformation is crucial for surgical training, pre-operative planning, and real-time haptic feedback systems. While physics-based models such as the finite element method (FEM) provide high-fidelity results, they are often computationally expensive and require extensive preprocessing. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) architecture that predicts both tissue surface deformation and applied force from sparse point clouds. The model incorporates internal anatomical information through binary tissue profiles beneath each point and leverages E(n)-equivariant message passing to improve robustness. We collected experimental data that comprises a real silicone and bone-like phantom, and complemented it with synthetic simulations generated using FEM. Our model achieves a comparable performance to a baseline GNN on standard test cases and significantly outperforms it in rotated and cross-resolution scenarios, showing a strong generalization to unseen orientations and point densities. It also achieves a significant speed improvement, offering a solution for real-time applications. When fine-tuned on experimental data, the model maintains sub-millimeter deformation accuracy despite limited sample size and measurement noise. The results demonstrate that our approach offers an efficient, data-driven alternative to traditional simulations, capable of generalizing across anatomical configurations and supporting interactive surgical environments.

Title: Error Analysis in a Modular Meeting Transcription System
Authors: Peter Vieting, Simon Berger, Thilo von Neumann, Christoph Boeddeker, Ralf Schlüter, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach
Abstract: Meeting transcription is a field of high relevance and remarkable progress in recent years. Still, challenges remain that limit its performance. In this work, we extend a previously proposed framework for analyzing leakage in speech separation with proper sensitivity to temporal locality. We show that there is significant leakage to the cross channel in areas where only the primary speaker is active. At the same time, the results demonstrate that this does not affect the final performance much as these leaked parts are largely ignored by the voice activity detection (VAD). Furthermore, different segmentations are compared showing that advanced diarization approaches are able to reduce the gap to oracle segmentation by a third compared to a simple energy-based VAD. We additionally reveal what factors contribute to the remaining difference. The results represent state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS among systems that train the recognition module on LibriSpeech data only.

Title: MPC for Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage Systems Using ARX Models
Authors: Johannes van Randenborgh, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: An aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) can mitigate CO2 emissions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for buildings. In application, an ATES keeps large quantities of thermal energy in groundwater-saturated aquifers. Normally, an ATES system comprises two (one for heat and one for cold) storages and supports the heating and cooling efforts of simultaneously present HVAC system components. This way, the operation and emissions of installed and, usually, fossil fuel-based components are reduced. The control of ATES systems is challenging, and various control schemes, including model predictive control (MPC), have been proposed. In this context, we present a lightweight input-output-data-based autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model of the hybrid ATES system dynamics. The ARX model allows the design of an output-based MPC scheme, resulting in an easy-to-solve quadratic program and avoiding challenging state estimations of ground temperatures. A numerical study discusses the accuracy of the ARX predictor and controller performance.

Title: Low-latency Assistive Audio Enhancement for Neurodivergent People
Authors: Alexander Popescu, Rosie Frost, Milos Cernak
Abstract: Neurodivergent people frequently experience decreased sound tolerance, with estimates suggesting it affects 50-70% of this population. This heightened sensitivity can provoke reactions ranging from mild discomfort to severe distress, highlighting the critical need for assistive audio enhancement technologies In this paper, we propose several assistive audio enhancement algorithms designed to selectively filter distressing sounds. To address this, we curated a list of potential trigger sounds by analyzing neurodivergent-focused communities on platforms such as Reddit. Using this list, a dataset of trigger sound samples was compiled from publicly available sources, including FSD50K and ESC50. These samples were then used to train and evaluate various Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Machine Learning (ML) audio enhancement algorithms. Among the approaches explored, Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) proved the most effective, successfully attenuating trigger sounds and reducing auditory distress for neurodivergent listeners.

Title: Learning Constraint Surrogate Model for Two-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment
Authors: Amir Bahador Javadi, Amin Kargarian, Mort Naraghi-Pour
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant uncertainty in power system operations, making traditional deterministic unit commitment approaches computationally expensive. This paper presents a machine learning surrogate modeling approach designed to reformulate the feasible design space of the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (TSUC) problem, reducing its computational complexity. The proposed method uses a support vector machine (SVM) to construct a surrogate model based on the governing equations of the learner. This model replaces the original 2|L| * |S| transmission line flow constraints, where |S| is the number of uncertainty scenarios and |L| is the number of transmission lines with |S| much less than |L|, with a significantly reduced set of 1 * |S| linear inequality constraints. The approach is theoretically grounded in the polyhedral structure of the feasible region under the DC power flow approximation, enabling the transformation of 2|L| line flow limit constraints into a single linear constraint. The surrogate model is trained using data generated from computationally efficient DC optimal power flow simulations. Simulation results on the IEEE 57-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrate SVM halfspace constraint accuracy of 99.72% and 99.88%, respectively, with TSUC computational time reductions of 46% and 31% and negligible generation cost increases (0.63% and 0.88% on average for IEEE 57- and 118-bus systems, respectively). This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for practical power system operations under renewable energy uncertainty.

Title: Real-time identification and control of influential pandemic regions using graph signal variation
Authors: Sudeepini Darapu, Subrata Ghosh, Dibakar Ghosh, Chittaranjan Hens, Santosh Nannuru
Abstract: The global spread of pandemics is facilitated by the mobility of populations, transforming localized infections into widespread phenomena. To contain it, timely identification of influential regions that accelerate this process is necessary. In this work, we model infection as a temporally evolving graph signal and propose graph signal variation-based metrics to capture spatio-temporal changes. Both graph domain and time domain locality are modeled. Based on this metric, we propose an online algorithm to identify influential regions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identifies geographical regions with a higher capacity to spread the infection. Isolating these regions leads to a significant reduction in cumulative infection. Simulations, along with analyses of hybrid H1N1 data and real-world Indian COVID-19 data, underscore the utility of proposed metric in enhancing our understanding and control of infection spread

Title: Low-Complexity Null-Space-Based Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme
Authors: Cheng Luo, Jie Hu, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Zhiqin Wang
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has attracted sustained interest. We propose a null-space-based transmission scheme for multiuser SWIPT serving both energy users (EUs) and information users (IUs). Under a practical nonlinear energy-harvesting (EH) model and multiple waveform options, we revisit the role of dedicated energy beams (EBs). We show that, in general, dedicated EBs are unnecessary because information beams (IBs) with Gaussian signaling can simultaneously support wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT), unless special energy-centric waveforms (e.g., deterministic sinusoidal waveforms) are employed and provide sufficient gains. Guided by these insights, we formulate an optimization problem for EB design to enable dedicated waveform transmission for WET, and we develop a low-complexity algorithm that reduces computation by ignoring the WET contribution of IBs during optimization. Numerical results corroborate that deterministic sinusoidal waveforms outperform Gaussian signaling when the received RF power lies in the EH high-efficiency region, making dedicated EBs beneficial. The proposed scheme achieves computational complexity reductions of 91.43\% and 98.54\% for the cases $M=8,,K^I=K^E=2$ and $M=16,,K^I=K^E=4$, respectively, with negligible performance loss, thereby validating the efficiency of the low-complexity algorithm.

Title: Multi-pathology Chest X-ray Classification with Rejection Mechanisms
Authors: Yehudit Aperstein, Amit Tzahar, Alon Gottlib, Tal Verber, Ravit Shagan Damti, Alexander Apartsin
Abstract: Overconfidence in deep learning models poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical imaging tasks, particularly in multi-label classification of chest X-rays, where multiple co-occurring pathologies must be detected simultaneously. This study introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for chest X-ray diagnosis based on a DenseNet-121 backbone, enhanced with two selective prediction mechanisms: entropy-based rejection and confidence interval-based rejection. Both methods enable the model to abstain from uncertain predictions, improving reliability by deferring ambiguous cases to clinical experts. A quantile-based calibration procedure is employed to tune rejection thresholds using either global or class-specific strategies. Experiments conducted on three large public datasets (PadChest, NIH ChestX-ray14, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that selective rejection improves the trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and coverage, with entropy-based rejection yielding the highest average AUC across all pathologies. These results support the integration of selective prediction into AI-assisted diagnostic workflows, providing a practical step toward safer, uncertainty-aware deployment of deep learning in clinical settings.

Title: Data-fused Model Predictive Control with Guarantees: Application to Flying Humanoid Robots
Authors: Davide Gorbani, Mohamed Elobaid, Giuseppe L'Erario, Hosameldin Awadalla Omer Mohamed, Daniele Pucci
Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown dynamics. Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.

Title: Realistic UE Antennas for 6G in the 3GPP Channel Model
Authors: Simon Svendsen, Dimitri Gold, Christian Rom, Volker Pauli, Vuokko Nurmela
Abstract: The transition to 6G has driven significant updates to the 3GPP channel model, particularly in modeling UE antennas and user-induced blockage for handheld devices. The 3GPP Rel.19 revision of TR 38.901 introduces a more realistic framework that captures directive antenna patterns, practical antenna placements, polarization effects, and element-specific blockage. These updates are based on high-fidelity simulations and measurements of a reference smartphone across multiple frequency ranges. By aligning link- and system-level simulations with real-world device behavior, the new model enables more accurate evaluation of 6G technologies and supports consistent performance assessment across industry and research.

Title: Merging Physics-Based Synthetic Data and Machine Learning for Thermal Monitoring of Lithium-ion Batteries: The Role of Data Fidelity
Authors: Yusheng Zheng, Wenxue Liu, Yunhong Che, Ferdinand Grimm, Jingyuan Zhao, Xiaosong Hu, Simona Onori, Remus Teodorescu, Gregory J. Offer
Abstract: Since the internal temperature is less accessible than surface temperature, there is an urgent need to develop accurate and real-time estimation algorithms for better thermal management and safety. This work presents a novel framework for resource-efficient and scalable development of accurate, robust, and adaptive internal temperature estimation algorithms by blending physics-based modeling with machine learning, in order to address the key challenges in data collection, model parameterization, and estimator design that traditionally hinder both approaches. In this framework, a physics-based model is leveraged to generate simulation data that includes different operating scenarios by sweeping the model parameters and input profiles. Such a cheap simulation dataset can be used to pre-train the machine learning algorithm to capture the underlying mapping relationship. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap resulting from imperfect modeling, transfer learning with unsupervised domain adaptation is applied to fine-tune the pre-trained machine learning model, by using limited operational data (without internal temperature values) from target batteries. The proposed framework is validated under different operating conditions and across multiple cylindrical batteries with convective air cooling, achieving a root mean square error of 0.5 °C when relying solely on prior knowledge of battery thermal properties, and less than 0.1 °C when using thermal parameters close to the ground truth. Furthermore, the role of the simulation data quality in the proposed framework has been comprehensively investigated to identify promising ways of synthetic data generation to guarantee the performance of the machine learning model.

Title: Human Body Segment Volume Estimation with Two RGB-D Cameras
Authors: Giulia Bassani, Emilio Maoddi, Usman Asghar, Carlo Alberto Avizzano, Alessandro Filippeschi
Abstract: In the field of human biometry, accurately estimating the volume of the whole body and its individual segments is of fundamental importance. Such measurements support a wide range of applications that include assessing health, optimizing ergonomic design, and customizing biomechanical models. In this work, we presented a Body Segment Volume Estimation (BSV) system to automatically compute whole-body and segment volumes using only two RGB-D cameras, thus limiting the system complexity. However, to maintain the accuracy comparable to 3D laser scanners, we enhanced the As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) non-rigid registration techniques, disconnecting its energy from the single triangle mesh. Thus, we improved the geometrical coherence of the reconstructed mesh, especially in the lateral gap areas. We evaluated BSV starting from the RGB-D camera performances, through the results obtained with FAUST dataset human body models, and comparing with a state-of-the-art work, up to real acquisitions. It showed superior ability in accurately estimating human body volumes, and it allows evaluating volume ratios between proximal and distal body segments, which are useful indices in many clinical applications.

Title: Robust Localization in Modern Cellular Networks using Global Map Features
Authors: Junshi Chen, Xuhong Li, Russ Whiton, Erik Leitinger, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) signal-based localization using modern cellular networks has emerged as a promising solution to accurately locate objects in challenging environments. One of the most promising solutions for situations involving obstructed-line-of-sight (OLoS) and multipath propagation is multipathbased simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) that employs map features (MFs), such as virtual anchors. This paper presents an extended MP-SLAM method that is augmented with a global map feature (GMF) repository. This repository stores consistent MFs of high quality that are collected during prior traversals. We integrate these GMFs back into the MP-SLAM framework via a probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates GMF intensity functions over time. Extensive simulations, together with a challenging real-world experiment using LTE RF signals in a dense urban scenario with severe multipath propagation and inter-cell interference, demonstrate that our framework achieves robust and accurate localization, thereby showcasing its effectiveness in realistic modern cellular networks such as 5G or future 6G networks. It outperforms conventional proprioceptive sensor-based localization and conventional MP-SLAM methods, and achieves reliable localization even under adverse signal conditions.

Title: TalkPlayData 2: An Agentic Synthetic Data Pipeline for Multimodal Conversational Music Recommendation
Authors: Keunwoo Choi, Seungheon Doh, Juhan Nam
Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In TalkPlayData 2 pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: Glorbit: A Modular, Web-Based Platform for AI Based Periorbital Measurement in Low-Resource Settings
Authors: George R. Nahass, Jacob van der Ende, Sasha Hubschman, Benjamin Beltran, Bhavana Kolli, Caitlin Berek, James D. Edmonds, R.V. Paul Chan, Pete Setabutr, James W. Larrick, Darvin Yi, Ann Q. Tran
Abstract: Periorbital measurements such as margin reflex distances (MRD1/2), palpebral fissure height, and scleral show are essential in diagnosing and managing conditions like ptosis and eyelid disorders. We developed Glorbit, a lightweight, browser-based application for automated periorbital distance measurement using artificial intelligence, designed for use in low-resource clinical settings. The app integrates a DeepLabV3 segmentation model into a modular pipeline with secure, site-specific Google Cloud storage. Glorbit supports offline mode, local preprocessing, and cloud upload via Firebase-authenticated logins. We evaluated usability, cross-platform compatibility, and deployment readiness through a simulated enrollment study of 15 volunteers. The app completed the full workflow -- metadata entry, image capture, segmentation, and upload -- on all tested sessions without error. Glorbit successfully ran on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones across major browsers. The segmentation model succeeded on all images. Average session time was 101.7 seconds (standard deviation: 17.5). Usability survey scores (1-5 scale) were uniformly high: intuitiveness and efficiency (5.0), workflow clarity (4.8), output confidence (4.9), and clinical utility (4.9). Glorbit provides a functional, scalable solution for standardized periorbital measurement in diverse environments. It supports secure data collection and may enable future development of real-time triage tools and multimodal AI-driven oculoplastics. Tool available at: this https URL

Title: VStyle: A Benchmark for Voice Style Adaptation with Spoken Instructions
Authors: Jun Zhan, Mingyang Han, Yuxuan Xie, Chen Wang, Dong Zhang, Kexin Huang, Haoxiang Shi, DongXiao Wang, Tengtao Song, Qinyuan Cheng, Shimin Li, Jun Song, Xipeng Qiu, Bo Zheng
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have emerged as a unified paradigm for speech understanding and generation, enabling natural human machine interaction. However, while most progress has focused on semantic accuracy and instruction following, the ability of SLMs to adapt their speaking style based on spoken instructions has received limited attention. We introduce Voice Style Adaptation (VSA), a new task that examines whether SLMs can modify their speaking style, such as timbre, prosody, or persona following natural language spoken commands. To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese & English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge) framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness, style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task. By releasing VStyle and its evaluation toolkit, we aim to provide the community with a foundation for advancing human centered spoken interaction. The dataset and code are publicly available at \href{this https URL}{project's homepage}.

Title: Testing chatbots on the creation of encoders for audio conditioned image generation
Authors: Jorge E. León, Miguel Carrasco
Abstract: On one hand, recent advances in chatbots has led to a rising popularity in using these models for coding tasks. On the other hand, modern generative image models primarily rely on text encoders to translate semantic concepts into visual representations, even when there is clear evidence that audio can be employed as input as well. Given the previous, in this work, we explore whether state-of-the-art conversational agents can design effective audio encoders to replace the CLIP text encoder from Stable Diffusion 1.5, enabling image synthesis directly from sound. We prompted five publicly available chatbots to propose neural architectures to work as these audio encoders, with a set of well-explained shared conditions. Each valid suggested encoder was trained on over two million context related audio-image-text observations, and evaluated on held-out validation and test sets using various metrics, together with a qualitative analysis of their generated images. Although almost all chatbots generated valid model designs, none achieved satisfactory results, indicating that their audio embeddings failed to align reliably with those of the original text encoder. Among the proposals, the Gemini audio encoder showed the best quantitative metrics, while the Grok audio encoder produced more coherent images (particularly, when paired with the text encoder). Our findings reveal a shared architectural bias across chatbots and underscore the remaining coding gap that needs to be bridged in future versions of these models. We also created a public demo so everyone could study and try out these audio encoders. Finally, we propose research questions that should be tackled in the future, and encourage other researchers to perform more focused and highly specialized tasks like this one, so the respective chatbots cannot make use of well-known solutions and their creativity/reasoning is fully tested.

Title: A Comprehensive Pipeline for Aortic Segmentation and Shape Analysis
Authors: Nairouz Shehata, Amr Elsawy, Mohamed Nagy, Muhammad ElMahdy, Mariam Ali, Soha Romeih, Heba Aguib, Magdi Yacoub, Ben Glocker
Abstract: Aortic shape analysis plays a key role in cardiovascular diagnostics, treatment planning, and understanding disease progression. We present a robust, fully automated pipeline for aortic shape analysis from cardiac MRI, combining deep learning and statistical techniques across segmentation, 3D surface reconstruction, and mesh registration. We benchmark leading segmentation models including nnUNet, TotalSegmentator, and MedSAM2 highlighting the effectiveness of domain specific training and transfer learning on a curated dataset. Following segmentation, we reconstruct high quality 3D meshes and introduce a DL based mesh registration method that directly optimises vertex displacements. This approach significantly outperforms classical rigid and nonrigid methods in geometric accuracy and anatomical consistency. Using the registered meshes, we perform statistical shape analysis on a cohort of 599 healthy subjects. Principal Component Analysis reveals dominant modes of aortic shape variation, capturing both global morphology and local structural differences under rigid and similarity transformations. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of integrating traditional geometry processing with learning based models for anatomically precise and scalable aortic analysis. This work lays the groundwork for future studies into pathological shape deviations and supports the development of personalised diagnostics in cardiovascular medicine.

Authors: Akansel Cosgun, Lachlan Chumbley, Benjamin J. Meyer
Abstract: This paper introduces the Australian Supermarket Object Set (ASOS), a comprehensive dataset comprising 50 readily available supermarket items with high-quality 3D textured meshes designed for benchmarking in robotics and computer vision applications. Unlike existing datasets that rely on synthetic models or specialized objects with limited accessibility, ASOS provides a cost-effective collection of common household items that can be sourced from a major Australian supermarket chain. The dataset spans 10 distinct categories with diverse shapes, sizes, and weights. 3D meshes are acquired by a structure-from-motion techniques with high-resolution imaging to generate watertight meshes. The dataset's emphasis on accessibility and real-world applicability makes it valuable for benchmarking object detection, pose estimation, and robotics applications.

Title: AI-enabled tuberculosis screening in a high-burden setting using cough sound analysis and speech foundation models
Authors: Ning Ma, Bahman Mirheidari, Guy J. Brown, Minyoi M. Maimbolwa, Nsala Sanjase, Solomon Chifwamba, Seke Muzazu, Monde Muyoyeta, Mary Kagujje
Abstract: Background Artificial intelligence (AI) can detect disease-related acoustic patterns in cough sounds, offering a scalable approach to tuberculosis (TB) screening in high-burden, low-resource settings. Previous studies have been limited by small datasets, under-representation of symptomatic non-TB patients, reliance on simple models, and recordings collected under idealised conditions. Methods We enrolled 512 participants at two hospitals in Zambia, grouped as bacteriologically confirmed TB (TB+), symptomatic patients with other respiratory diseases (OR), and healthy controls (HC). Usable cough recordings plus demographic and clinical data were obtained from 500 participants. Deep learning classifiers based on speech foundation models were trained on cough recordings. The best-performing model, trained on 3-second segments, was further evaluated with demographic and clinical features. Findings The best audio-only classifier achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing TB+ from all others (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus OR. Adding demographic and clinical features improved performance to 92.1% (TB+/Rest) and 84.2% (TB+/OR). At a threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3% sensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, and 80.6% and 73.1% for TB+/OR. Interpretation Cough analysis using speech foundation models, especially when combined with demographic and clinical data, showed strong potential as a TB triage tool, meeting WHO target product profile benchmarks. The model was robust to confounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device variability, indicating detection of genuine disease-related acoustic patterns. Further validation across diverse regions and case definitions, including subclinical TB, is required before clinical use.

Title: DiTReducio: A Training-Free Acceleration for DiT-Based TTS via Progressive Calibration
Authors: Yanru Huo, Ziyue Jiang, Zuoli Tang, Qingyang Hong, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have advanced non-autoregressive (NAR) speech synthesis, their high computational demands remain an limitation. Existing DiT-based text-to-speech (TTS) model acceleration approaches mainly focus on reducing sampling steps through distillation techniques, yet they remain constrained by training costs. We introduce DiTReducio, a training-free acceleration framework that compresses computations in DiT-based TTS models via progressive calibration. We propose two compression methods, Temporal Skipping and Branch Skipping, to eliminate redundant computations during inference. Moreover, based on two characteristic attention patterns identified within DiT layers, we devise a pattern-guided strategy to selectively apply the compression methods. Our method allows flexible modulation between generation quality and computational efficiency through adjustable compression thresholds. Experimental evaluations conducted on F5-TTS and MegaTTS 3 demonstrate that DiTReducio achieves a 75.4% reduction in FLOPs and improves the Real-Time Factor (RTF) by 37.1%, while preserving generation quality.

Title: Combining Textual and Spectral Features for Robust Classification of Pilot Communications
Authors: Abdullah All Tanvir, Chenyu Huang, Moe Alahmad, Chuyang Yang, Xin Zhong
Abstract: Accurate estimation of aircraft operations, such as takeoffs and landings, is critical for effective airport management, yet remains challenging, especially at non-towered facilities lacking dedicated surveillance infrastructure. This paper presents a novel dual pipeline machine learning framework that classifies pilot radio communications using both textual and spectral features. Audio data collected from a non-towered U.S. airport was annotated by certified pilots with operational intent labels and preprocessed through automatic speech recognition and Mel-spectrogram extraction. We evaluate a wide range of traditional classifiers and deep learning models, including ensemble methods, LSTM, and CNN across both pipelines. To our knowledge, this is the first system to classify operational aircraft intent using a dual-pipeline ML framework on real-world air traffic audio. Our results demonstrate that spectral features combined with deep architectures consistently yield superior classification performance, with F1-scores exceeding 91%. Data augmentation further improves robustness to real-world audio variability. The proposed approach is scalable, cost-effective, and deployable without additional infrastructure, offering a practical solution for air traffic monitoring at general aviation airports.

Title: SoilSound: Smartphone-based Soil Moisture Estimation
Authors: Yixuan Gao, Tanvir Ahmed, Shuang He, Zhongqi Cheng, Rajalakshmi Nandakumar
Abstract: Soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and environmental management, yet existing methods require either invasive probes disturbing the soil or specialized equipment, limiting access to the public. We present SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan, which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.

Title: CoDiCodec: Unifying Continuous and Discrete Compressed Representations of Audio
Authors: Marco Pasini, Stefan Lattner, George Fazekas
Abstract: Efficiently representing audio signals in a compressed latent space is critical for latent generative modelling. However, existing autoencoders often force a choice between continuous embeddings and discrete tokens. Furthermore, achieving high compression ratios while maintaining audio fidelity remains a challenge. We introduce CoDiCodec, a novel audio autoencoder that overcomes these limitations by both efficiently encoding global features via summary embeddings, and by producing both compressed continuous embeddings at ~ 11 Hz and discrete tokens at a rate of 2.38 kbps from the same trained model, offering unprecedented flexibility for different downstream generative tasks. This is achieved through Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a novel FSQ-dropout technique, and does not require additional loss terms beyond the single consistency loss used for end-to-end training. CoDiCodec supports both autoregressive decoding and a novel parallel decoding strategy, with the latter achieving superior audio quality and faster decoding. CoDiCodec outperforms existing continuous and discrete autoencoders at similar bitrates in terms of reconstruction audio quality. Our work enables a unified approach to audio compression, bridging the gap between continuous and discrete generative modelling paradigms.

Title: Adaptive Token Merging for Efficient Transformer Semantic Communication at the Edge
Authors: Omar Erak, Omar Alhussein, Hatem Abou-Zeid, Mehdi Bennis, Sami Muhaidat
Abstract: Large-scale transformers are central to modern semantic communication, yet their high computational and communication costs hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper introduces a training-free framework for adaptive token merging, a novel mechanism that compresses transformer representations at runtime by selectively merging semantically redundant tokens under per-layer similarity thresholds. Unlike prior fixed-ratio reduction, our approach couples merging directly to input redundancy, enabling data-dependent adaptation that balances efficiency and task relevance without retraining. We cast the discovery of merging strategies as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverage Bayesian optimization to obtain Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, inference cost, and communication cost. On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the unmodified transformer with 30\% fewer floating-point operations per second and under 20\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question answering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model at less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth. Finally, we show that our adaptive merging is robust across varying channel conditions and provides inherent privacy benefits, substantially degrading the efficacy of model inversion attacks. Our framework provides a practical and versatile solution for deploying powerful transformer models in resource-limited edge intelligence scenarios.

Title: Efficient and Accurate Downfacing Visual Inertial Odometry
Authors: Jonas Kühne, Christian Vogt, Michele Magno, Luca Benini
Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips (SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods, was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24 pixels/frame.

Title: Semantic Rate-Distortion Theory with Applications
Authors: Yi-Qun Zhao, Zhi-Ming Ma, Geoffrey Ye Li, Shuai Yuan, Tong Ye, Chuan Zhou
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era for communication. As a result, the establishment of a semantic communication framework is putting on the agenda. Based on a realistic semantic communication model, this paper develops a rate-distortion framework for semantic compression. Different from the existing works primarily focusing on decoder-side estimation of intrinsic meaning and ignoring its inherent issues, such as ambiguity and polysemy, we exploit a constraint of conditional semantic probability distortion to effectively capture the essential features of practical semantic exchanges in an AI-assisted communication system. With the help of the methods in rate-distortion-perception theory, we establish a theorem specifying the minimum achievable rate under this semantic constraint and a traditional symbolic constraint and obtain its closed-form limit for a particular semantic scenario. From the experiments in this paper, bounding conditional semantic probability distortion can effectively improve both semantic transmission accuracy and bit-rate efficiency. Our framework bridges information theory and AI, enabling potential applications in bandwidth-efficient semantic-aware networks, enhanced transceiver understanding, and optimized semantic transmission for AI-driven systems.

Title: Maximising Energy Efficiency in Large-Scale Open RAN: Hybrid xApps and Digital Twin Integration
Authors: Ahmed Al-Tahmeesschi, Yi Chu, Gurdeep Singh, Charles Turyagyenda, Dritan Kaleshi, David Grace, Hamed Ahmadi
Abstract: The growing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications in 5G and beyond networks has significantly driven up power consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This surge in energy demand poses critical operational and sustainability challenges for mobile network operators, necessitating innovative solutions that enhance energy efficiency without compromising Quality of Service (QoS). Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, offers disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, promoting flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this disaggregated approach adds complexity, particularly in managing power consumption across diverse network components such as Open Radio Units (RUs). In this paper, we propose a hybrid xApp leveraging heuristic methods and unsupervised machine learning, integrated with digital twin technology through the TeraVM AI RAN Scenario Generator (AI-RSG). This approach dynamically manages RU sleep modes to effectively reduce energy consumption. Our experimental evaluation in a realistic, large-scale emulated Open RAN scenario demonstrates that the hybrid xApp achieves approximately 13% energy savings, highlighting its practicality and significant potential for real-world deployments without compromising user QoS.

Title: Prominence-aware automatic speech recognition for conversational speech
Authors: Julian Linke, Barbara Schuppler
Abstract: This paper investigates prominence-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR) by combining prominence detection and speech recognition for conversational Austrian German. First, prominence detectors were developed by fine-tuning wav2vec2 models to classify word-level prominence. The detector was then used to automatically annotate prosodic prominence in a large corpus. Based on those annotations, we trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that simultaneously transcribe words and their prominence levels. The integration of prominence information did not change performance compared to our baseline ASR system, while reaching a prominence detection accuracy of 85.53% for utterances where the recognized word sequence was correct. This paper shows that transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information and represents a novel contribution to prosody-enhanced ASR, with potential applications for linguistic research and prosody-informed dialogue systems.

Title: Constrained Variational Inference via Safe Particle Flow
Authors: Yinzhuang Yi, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: We propose a control barrier function (CBF) formulation for enforcing equality and inequality constraints in variational inference. The key idea is to define a barrier functional on the space of probability density functions that encode the desired constraints imposed on the variational density. By leveraging the Liouville equation, we establish a connection between the time derivative of the variational density and the particle drift, which enables the systematic construction of corresponding CBFs associated to the particle drift. Enforcing these CBFs gives rise to the safe particle flow and ensures that the variational density satisfies the original constraints imposed by the barrier functional. This formulation provides a principled and computationally tractable solution to constrained variational inference, with theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical simulations.

Title: Data distribution impacts the performance and generalisability of contrastive learning-based foundation models of electrocardiograms
Authors: Gul Rukh Khattak, Konstantinos Patlatzoglou, Joseph Barker, Libor Pastika, Boroumand Zeidaabadi, Ahmed El-Medany, Hesham Aggour, Yixiu Liang, Antonio H. Ribeiro, Jeffrey Annis, Antonio Luiz Pinho Ribeiro, Junbo Ge, Daniel B. Kramer, Jonathan W. Waks, Evan Brittain, Nicholas Peters, Fu Siong Ng, Arunashis Sau
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.

Title: PL-Net: Progressive Learning Network for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Kunpeng Mao, Ruoyu Li, Junlong Cheng, Danmei Huang, Zhiping Song, ZeKui Liu
Abstract: In recent years, deep convolutional neural network-based segmentation methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many medical analysis tasks. However, most of these approaches rely on optimizing the U-Net structure or adding new functional modules, which overlooks the complementation and fusion of coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic information. To address these issues, we propose a 2D medical image segmentation framework called Progressive Learning Network (PL-Net), which comprises Internal Progressive Learning (IPL) and External Progressive Learning (EPL). PL-Net offers the following advantages: (1) IPL divides feature extraction into two steps, allowing for the mixing of different size receptive fields and capturing semantic information from coarse to fine granularity without introducing additional parameters; (2) EPL divides the training process into two stages to optimize parameters and facilitate the fusion of coarse-grained information in the first stage and fine-grained information in the second stage. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our proposed method on five medical image segmentation datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that PL-Net achieves competitive segmentation performance. It is worth noting that PL-Net does not introduce any additional learnable parameters compared to other U-Net variants.

Title: Integrative Variational Autoencoders for Generative Modeling of an Image Outcome with Multiple Input Images
Authors: Bowen Lei, Yeseul Jeon, Rajarshi Guhaniyogi, Aaron Scheffler, Bani Mallick, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiatives
Abstract: Understanding relationships across multiple imaging modalities is central to neuroimaging research. We introduce the Integrative Variational Autoencoder (InVA), the first hierarchical VAE framework for image-on-image regression in multimodal neuroimaging. Unlike standard VAEs, which are not designed for predictive integration across modalities, InVA models outcome images as functions of both shared and modality-specific features. This flexible, data-driven approach avoids rigid assumptions of classical tensor regression and outperforms conventional VAEs and nonlinear models such as BART. As a key application, InVA accurately predicts costly PET scans from structural MRI, offering an efficient and powerful tool for multimodal neuroimaging.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Identification of Linear Models with Integrating Disturbances for Offset-Free Control
Authors: Steven J. Kuntz, James B. Rawlings
Abstract: This report addresses the maximum likelihood identification of models for offset-free model predictive control, where linear time-invariant models are augmented with (fictitious) uncontrollable integrating modes, called integrating disturbances. The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical's plant in Kingsport, TN.

Title: Modelling the 5G Energy Consumption using Real-world Data: Energy Fingerprint is All You Need
Authors: Tingwei Chen, Yantao Wang, Hanzhi Chen, Zijian Zhao, Xinhao Li, Nicola Piovesan, Guangxu Zhu, Qingjiang Shi
Abstract: The introduction of 5G technology has revolutionized communications, enabling unprecedented capacity, connectivity, and ultra-fast, reliable communications. However, this leap has led to a substantial increase in energy consumption, presenting a critical challenge for network sustainability. Accurate energy consumption modeling is essential for developing energy-efficient strategies, enabling operators to optimize resource utilization while maintaining network performance. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning model for 5G base station energy consumption estimation based on a real-world dataset. Unlike existing methods, our approach integrates the Base Station Identifier (BSID) as an input feature through an embedding layer, capturing unique energy patterns across different base stations. We further introduce a masked training method and an attention mechanism to enhance generalization and accuracy. Experimental results show significant improvements, reducing Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) from 12.75% to 4.98%, achieving over 60% performance gain compared to existing models. The source code for our model is available at this https URL.

Title: Deep Survival Analysis from Adult and Pediatric Electrocardiograms: A Multi-center Benchmark Study
Authors: Platon Lukyanenko, Joshua Mayourian, Mingxuan Liu, John K. Triedman, Sunil J. Ghelani, William G. La Cava
Abstract: Artificial intelligence applied to electrocardiography (AI-ECG) shows potential for mortality prediction, but heterogeneous approaches and private datasets have limited generalizable insights. To address this, we systematically evaluated model design choices across three large cohorts: Beth Israel Deaconess (MIMIC-IV: n = 795,546 ECGs, United States), Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (Code-15: n = 345,779, Brazil), and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH: n = 255,379, United States). We evaluated models predicting all-cause mortality, comparing horizon-based classification and deep survival methods with neural architectures including convolutional networks and transformers, benchmarking against demographic-only and gradient boosting baselines. Top models performed well (median concordance: Code-15, 0.83; MIMIC-IV, 0.78; BCH, 0.81). Incorporating age and sex improved performance across all datasets. Classifier-Cox models showed site-dependent sensitivity to horizon choice (median Pearson's R: Code-15, 0.35; MIMIC-IV, -0.71; BCH, 0.37). External validation reduced concordance, and in some cases demographic-only models outperformed externally trained AI-ECG models on Code-15. However, models trained on multi-site data outperformed site-specific models by 5-22%. Findings highlight factors for robust AI-ECG deployment: deep survival methods outperformed horizon-based classifiers, demographic covariates improved predictive performance, classifier-based models required site-specific calibration, and cross-cohort training, even between adult and pediatric cohorts, substantially improved performance. These results emphasize the importance of model type, demographics, and training diversity in developing AI-ECG models reliably applicable across populations.

Title: Improving 3D Cellular Positioning Integrity with Bayesian RAIM
Authors: Liqin Ding, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Hyowon Kim, Russ Whiton, Erik G. Ström, Jonas Sjöberg, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Ensuring positioning integrity amid faulty measurements is crucial for safety-critical applications, making receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) indispensable. This paper introduces a Bayesian RAIM algorithm with a streamlined architecture for snapshot-type 3D cellular positioning. Unlike traditional frequentist-type RAIM algorithms, it computes the exact posterior probability density function (PDF) of the position vector as a Gaussian mixture (GM) model using efficient message passing along a factor graph. This Bayesian approach retains all crucial information from the measurements, eliminates the need to discard faulty measurements, and results in tighter protection levels (PLs) in 3D space and 1D/2D subspaces that meet target integrity risk (TIR) requirements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the Bayesian RAIM algorithm significantly outperforms a baseline algorithm, achieving over $50\%$ PL reduction at a comparable computational cost.

Title: Simple controller design to achieve iso-damping robustness: Non-iterative data-driven approach based on fractional-order reference model
Authors: Ansei Yonezawa, Heisei Yonezawa, Shuichi Yahagi, Itsuro Kajiwara
Abstract: This study proposes a simple controller design approach to achieve a class of robustness, the so-called iso-damping property. The proposed approach can be executed using only one-shot input/output data. An accurate mathematical model of a controlled plant is not required. The model-reference control problem is defined to achieve the desired closed-loop specifications, including the iso-damping, and the reference model is designed on the basis of fractional-order calculus. The optimization problem for the model-reference control is formulated using the one-shot input/output data while considering the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. The iso-damping robust controller is obtained by solving the optimization problem. The representative advantages of the proposed approach over the conventional methods are the simplicity, practicality, and reliability from the viewpoint of the unnecessity of the plant model and explicit consideration of the BIBO stability from a bounded reference input to a bounded output. Numerical and experimental studies demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

Title: Sparse Actuation for LPV Systems with Full-State Feedback in $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Framework
Authors: Tanay Kumar, Raktim Bhattacharya
Abstract: This paper addresses the sparse actuation problem for nonlinear systems represented in the Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. We propose a convex optimization framework that concurrently determines actuator magnitude limits and the state-feedback law that guarantees a user-specified closed-loop performance in the $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense. We also demonstrate that sparse actuation is achieved when the actuator magnitude-limits are minimized in the $l_1$ sense. This is the first paper that addresses this problem for LPV systems. The formulation is demonstrated in a vibration control problem for a flexible wing.

Title: Spatiotemporal Tubes for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks in Unknown Systems
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Ahan Basu, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: The paper considers the controller synthesis problem for general MIMO systems with unknown dynamics, aiming to fulfill the temporal reach-avoid-stay task, where the unsafe regions are time-dependent, and the target must be reached within a specified time frame. The primary aim of the paper is to construct the spatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a closed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system trajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets. The proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide controllers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our sampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust optimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by infinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization program (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and closed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal reach-avoid-stay specification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three case studies: an omnidirectional robot, a SCARA manipulator, and a magnetic levitation system.

Title: Nuisance-free Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System Design: Merging Exponential-CBF and Adaptive Sliding Manifolds
Authors: Ege C. Altunkaya, Ibrahim Ozkol
Abstract: The significance of the automatic ground collision avoidance system (Auto-GCAS) has been proven by considering the fatal crashes that have occurred over decades. Even though extensive efforts have been put forth to address the ground collision avoidance in the literature, the notion of being nuisance-free has not been sufficiently addressed. At this point, in this study, the Auto-GCAS design is formulated by merging exponential control barrier functions with sliding manifolds to manipulate the barrier function dynamics. The adaptive properties of the sliding manifolds are tailored to the key and governing flight parameters, ensuring that the nuisance-free requirement is satisfied. Furthermore, to ensure all safety requirements are met, a flight envelope protection algorithm is designed using control barrier functions to assess the commands generated by the Auto-GCAS. Eventually, the performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, focusing on authority-sharing, collision avoidance capability, and nuisance-free operation through various scenarios and Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Superimposed Pilot-Based OTFS -- Will It Work?
Authors: Yuta Kanazawa, Hiroki Iimori, Chandan Pradhan, Szabolcs Malomsoky, Naoki Ishikawa
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a promising solution to handle doubly-selective fading, but its channel estimation is a nontrivial task in terms of maximizing spectral efficiency. Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.

Title: Enhancing Speech Large Language Models with Prompt-Aware Mixture of Audio Encoders
Authors: Weiqiao Shan, Yuang Li, Yuhao Zhang, Yingfeng Luo, Chen Xu, Xiaofeng Zhao, Long Meng, Yunfei Lu, Min Zhang, Hao Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu
Abstract: Connecting audio encoders with large language models (LLMs) allows the LLM to perform various audio understanding tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio captioning (AC). Most research focuses on training an adapter layer to generate a unified audio feature for the LLM. However, different tasks may require distinct features that emphasize either semantic or acoustic aspects, making task-specific audio features more desirable. In this paper, we propose Prompt-aware Mixture (PaM) to enhance the Speech LLM that uses multiple audio encoders. Our approach involves using different experts to extract different features based on the prompt that indicates different tasks. Experiments demonstrate that with PaM, only one Speech LLM surpasses the best performances achieved by all single-encoder Speech LLMs on ASR, Speaker Number Verification, and AC tasks. PaM also outperforms other feature fusion baselines, such as concatenation and averaging. Our code would be available at: this https URL

Title: Generalized Ray Tracing with Basis functions for Tomographic Projections
Authors: Youssef Haouchat, Sepand Kashani, Philippe Thévenaz, Michael Unser
Abstract: This work aims at the precise and efficient computation of the x-ray projection of an image represented by a linear combination of general shifted basis functions that typically overlap. We achieve this with a suitable adaptation of ray tracing, which is one of the most efficient methods to compute line integrals. In our work, the cases in which the image is expressed as a spline are of particular relevance. The proposed implementation is applicable to any projection geometry as it computes the forward and backward operators over a collection of arbitrary lines. We validate our work with experiments in the context of inverse problems for image reconstruction and maximize the image quality for a given resolution of the reconstruction grid.

Authors: Di Zhang, Yuanhao Cui, Xiaowen Cao, Nanchi Su, Yi Gong, Fan Liu, Weijie Yuan, Xiaojun Jing, J. Andrew Zhang, Jie Xu, Christos Masouros, Dusit Niyato, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables efficient spectrum utilization and reduces hardware costs for beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, facilitating intelligent applications that require both high-performance communication and precise sensing capabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of ISAC over the years. We examine the expansion of the spectrum across RF and optical ISAC, highlighting the role of advanced technologies, along with key challenges and synergies. We further discuss the advancements in network architecture from single-cell to multi-cell systems, emphasizing the integration of collaborative sensing and interference mitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyze the progress from single-modal to multi-modal sensing, with a focus on the integration of edge intelligence to enable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance decision-making. Finally, we extensively review standardization efforts by 3GPP, IEEE, and ITU, examining the transition of ISAC-related technologies and their implications for the deployment of 6G networks.

Title: Diffusion Buffer: Online Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement with Sub-Second Latency
Authors: Bunlong Lay, Rostislav Makarov, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.

Abstract: We present Quanta Diffusion (QuDi), a powerful generative video reconstruction method for single-photon imaging. QuDi is an algorithm supporting the latest Quanta Image Sensors (QIS) and Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) for extremely low-light imaging conditions. Compared to existing methods, QuDi overcomes the difficulties of simultaneously managing the motion and the strong shot noise. The core innovation of QuDi is to inject a physics-based forward model into the diffusion algorithm, while keeping the motion estimation in the loop. QuDi demonstrates an average of 2.4 dB PSNR improvement over the best existing methods.

Title: Model Predictive Control-Based Optimal Energy Management of Autonomous Electric Vehicles Under Cold Temperatures
Authors: Shanthan Kumar Padisala, Satadru Dey
Abstract: In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.

Title: General Reference Frame Identification and Transformation in Unbalanced Power Systems
Authors: Francisco G. Montoya, Santiago Sánchez Acevedo
Abstract: Coordinate transformations provide dimensional reduction benefits across power system analysis, electric machine modeling, and power electronic converter control. This paper introduces a novel transformation based on Geometric Algebra that directly identifies the plane containing unbalanced quantity loci through bivector analysis. The method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems, requiring only two voltage or current measurements at different time instants. Through pure geometric reasoning, we demonstrate that our approach generalizes existing techniques while extending naturally to multi-dimensional systems. Experimental validation using real-time digital simulation and physical laboratory testing confirms the method's effectiveness under realistic conditions. Power electronics converter control implementation demonstrates significant practical advantages, eliminating zero component oscillations present in Clarke transformation under unbalanced conditions and enabling more effective control architectures. The combination of computational efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability represents a significant advancement for power system control applications.

Title: Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES) with Bias-Switchable Row-Column Arrays
Authors: Darren Olufemi Dahunsi, Randy Palmar, Tyler Henry, Mohammad Rahim Sobhani, Negar Majidi, Joy Wang, Afshin Kashani Ilkhechi, Jeremy Brown, Roger Zemp
Abstract: Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays, also known as bias-switchable row-column arrays (RCAs), allow for imaging techniques otherwise impossible for non-bias-switachable RCAs. Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES) is a novel imaging technique that allows for expansive 3D scanning by transmitting plane or cylindrical wavefronts and receiving using Hadamard-Encoded-Read-Out (HERO) to perform beamforming on what is effectively a full 2D synthetic receive aperture. This allows imaging beyond the shadow of the aperture of the RCA array, potentially allows for whole organ imaging and 3D visualization of tissue morphology. It additionally enables view large volumes through limited windows. In this work we demonstrated with simulation that we are able to image at comparable resolution to existing RCA imaging methods at tens to hundreds of volumes per second. We validated these simulations by demonstrating an experimental implementation of HERCULES using a custom fabricated TOBE array, custom biasing electronics, and a research ultrasound system. Furthermore, we assess our imaging capabilities by imaging a commercial phantom, and comparing our results to those taken with traditional RCA imaging methods. Finally, we verified our ability to image real tissue by imaging a xenograft mouse model.

Title: Uncovering Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Brain Tumor Surgery with AI-Driven Methods
Authors: Carmen Jimenez-Mesa, Yizhou Wan, Guilio Sansone, Francisco J. Martinez-Murcia, Javier Ramirez, Pietro Lio, Juan M. Gorriz, Stephen J. Price, John Suckling, Michail Mamalakis
Abstract: Brain tumor resection is a highly complex procedure with profound implications for survival and quality of life. Predicting patient outcomes is crucial to guide clinicians in balancing oncological control with preservation of neurological function. However, building reliable prediction models is severely limited by the rarity of curated datasets that include both pre- and post-surgery imaging, given the clinical, logistical and ethical challenges of collecting such data. In this study, we develop a novel framework that integrates explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with neuroimaging-based feature engineering for survival assessment in brain tumor patients. We curated structural MRI data from 49 patients scanned pre- and post-surgery, providing a rare resource for identifying survival-related biomarkers. A key methodological contribution is the development of a global explanation optimizer, which refines survival-related feature attribution in deep learning models, thereby improving both the interpretability and reliability of predictions. From a clinical perspective, our findings provide important evidence that survival after oncological surgery is influenced by alterations in regions related to cognitive and sensory functions. These results highlight the importance of preserving areas involved in decision-making and emotional regulation to improve long-term outcomes. From a technical perspective, the proposed optimizer advances beyond state-of-the-art XAI methods by enhancing both the fidelity and comprehensibility of model explanations, thus reinforcing trust in the recognition patterns driving survival prediction. This work demonstrates the utility of XAI-driven neuroimaging analysis in identifying survival-related variability and underscores its potential to inform precision medicine strategies in brain tumor treatment.

Title: Comprehensive Analysis and Exclusion Hypothesis of $α$-Approximation Method for Discretizing Analog Systems
Authors: Shen Chen, Jisong Wang, Dejun Liu, Jiaxi Ying, Shuai Wang
Abstract: A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain) into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range. This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing amplitude and phase distortion.

Title: IS${}^3$ : Generic Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation in Acoustic Scenes using Deep Filtering
Authors: Clémentine Berger (S2A, IDS), Paraskevas Stamatiadis (S2A, IDS), Roland Badeau (S2A, IDS), Slim Essid (S2A, IDS)
Abstract: We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet filtering on objective separation metrics.

Title: Tangential Action Spaces: Geometry, Memory and Cost in Holonomic and Nonholonomic Agents
Authors: Marcel Blattner
Abstract: Living systems balance energetic efficiency with the capacity for path-dependent effects. We introduce Tangential Action Spaces (TAS), a geometric framework that models embodied agents as hierarchies of manifolds linked by projections from physical states to cognitive representations and onward to intentions. Lifts from intentions back to actions may follow multiple routes that differ in energy cost and in whether they leave memory-like traces. Under explicit assumptions, we prove: (i) if the physical-to-cognitive map is locally invertible, there is a unique lift that minimises instantaneous energy and yields no path-dependent memory; any memory requires strictly positive excess energy. (ii) If multiple physical states map to a cognitive state (a fibration), the energy-minimising lift is the metric-weighted pseudoinverse of the projection. (iii) In systems with holonomy, excess energy grows quadratically with the size of the induced memory for sufficiently small loops, establishing a local cost-memory law. These results motivate a classification of embodied systems by the origin of path dependence: intrinsically conservative, conditionally conservative, geometrically nonconservative, and dynamically nonconservative. Numerical examples illustrate each case. We also present a reflective extension (rTAS) in which perception depends on a learnable model state; a block metric formalises an effort-learning trade-off, and cross-curvature terms couple physical and model holonomy. Simulations of single- and two-agent settings show role asymmetries and sensitivity to coupling. TAS provides a geometric language linking embodiment, memory, and energetic cost, yielding testable predictions and design guidelines for biological and robotic systems.

Title: Power-Measurement-Based Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS
Authors: Yijie Liu, Weidong Mei, He Sun, Dong Wang, Peilan Wang
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI. This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation, based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of training reflections is large.

Title: Out-Of-Distribution Detection for Audio-visual Generalized Zero-Shot Learning: A General Framework
Authors: Liuyuan Wen
Abstract: Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is a challenging task requiring accurate classification of both seen and unseen classes. Within this domain, Audio-visual GZSL emerges as an extremely exciting yet difficult task, given the inclusion of both visual and acoustic features as multi-modal inputs. Existing efforts in this field mostly utilize either embedding-based or generative-based methods. However, generative training is difficult and unstable, while embedding-based methods often encounter domain shift problem. Thus, we find it promising to integrate both methods into a unified framework to leverage their advantages while mitigating their respective disadvantages. Our study introduces a general framework employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to harness the strengths of both approaches. We first employ generative adversarial networks to synthesize unseen features, enabling the training of an OOD detector alongside classifiers for seen and unseen classes. This detector determines whether a test feature belongs to seen or unseen classes, followed by classification utilizing separate classifiers for each feature type. We test our framework on three popular audio-visual datasets and observe a significant improvement comparing to existing state-of-the-art works. Codes can be found in this https URL.

Title: A Conflicts-free, Speed-lossless KAN-based Reinforcement Learning Decision System for Interactive Driving in Roundabouts
Authors: Zhihao Lin, Zhen Tian, Jianglin Lan, Qi Zhang, Ziyang Ye, Hanyang Zhuang, Xianxian Zhao
Abstract: Safety and efficiency are crucial for autonomous driving in roundabouts, especially mixed traffic with both autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles. This paper presents a learning-based algorithm that promotes safe and efficient driving across varying roundabout traffic conditions. A deep Q-learning network is used to learn optimal strategies in complex multi-vehicle roundabout scenarios, while a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) improves the AVs' environmental understanding. To further enhance safety, an action inspector filters unsafe actions, and a route planner optimizes driving efficiency. Moreover, model predictive control ensures stability and precision in execution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving fewer collisions, reduced travel time, and stable training with smooth reward convergence.

Title: LoFi: Vision-Aided Label Generator for Wi-Fi Localization and Tracking
Authors: Zijian Zhao, Tingwei Chen, Fanyi Meng, Zhijie Cai, Hang Li, Xiaoyang Li, Guangxu Zhu
Abstract: Data-driven Wi-Fi localization and tracking have shown great promise due to their lower reliance on specialized hardware compared to model-based methods. However, most existing data collection techniques provide only coarse-grained ground truth or a limited number of labeled points, significantly hindering the advancement of data-driven approaches. While systems like lidar can deliver precise ground truth, their high costs make them inaccessible to many users. To address these challenges, we propose LoFi, a vision-aided label generator for Wi-Fi localization and tracking. LoFi can generate ground truth position coordinates solely from 2D images, offering high precision, low cost, and ease of use. Utilizing our method, we have compiled a Wi-Fi tracking and localization dataset using the ESP32-S3 and a webcam. The code and dataset of this paper are available at this https URL.

Title: Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: Advances, Expert Insights, and A Conceptual Framework
Authors: Yongqi Dong, Bart van Arem, Haneen Farah
Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the literature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.

Title: QuantX: A Framework for Hardware-Aware Quantization of Generative AI Workloads
Authors: Muhammad Ahmad, Khurram Mazher, Saqib Akram, Ahmad Tameem, Saad Bin Nasir
Abstract: We present QuantX: a tailored suite of recipes for LLM and VLM quantization. It is capable of quantizing down to 3-bit resolutions with minimal loss in performance. The quantization strategies in QuantX take into account hardware-specific constraints to achieve efficient dequantization during inference ensuring flexible trade-off between runtime speed, memory requirement and model accuracy. Our results demonstrate that QuantX achieves performance within 6% of the unquantized model for LlaVa-v1.6 quantized down to 3-bits for multiple end user tasks and outperforms recently published state-of-the-art quantization techniques. We further integrate one particular technique from QuantX into the popular this http URL framework and show its feasibility in terms of runtime compared to the mainstream quantization techniques from this http URL. Lastly, this manuscript provides insights into the LLM quantization process that motivated the range of recipes and options that are incorporated in QuantX.

Title: Towards Reliable Audio Deepfake Attribution and Model Recognition: A Multi-Level Autoencoder-Based Framework
Authors: Andrea Di Pierno (1), Luca Guarnera (2), Dario Allegra (2), Sebastiano Battiato (2) ((1) IMT School of Advanced Studies, (2) University of Catania)
Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code.

Title: Per-antenna power constraints: constructing Pareto-optimal precoders with cubic complexity under non-negligible noise conditions
Authors: Sergey Petrov, Samson Lasaulce, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: Precoding matrix construction is a key element of the wireless signal processing using the multiple-input and multiple-output model. It is established that the problem of global throughput optimization under per-antenna power constraints belongs, in general, to the class of monotonic optimization problems, and is unsolvable in real-time. The most widely used real-time baseline is the suboptimal solution of Zero-Forcing, which achieves a cubic complexity by discarding the background noise coefficients. This baseline, however, is not readily adapted to per-antenna power constraints, and performs poorly if background noise coefficients are not negligible. In this paper, we are going to present a computational algorithm which constructs a precoder that is SINR multiobjective Pareto-optimal under per-antenna power constraints - with a complexity that differs from that of Zero-Forcing only by a constant factor. The algorithm has a set of input parameters, changing which skews the importance of particular user throughputs: these parameters make up an efficient parameterization of the entire Pareto boundary.
