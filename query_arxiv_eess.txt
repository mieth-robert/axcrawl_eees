Title: Signals vs. Videos: Advancing Motion Intention Recognition for Human-Robot Collaboration in Construction
Authors: Charan Gajjala Chenchu, Kinam Kim, Gao Lu, Zia Ud Din
Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the construction industry depends on precise and prompt recognition of human motion intentions and actions by robots to maximize safety and workflow efficiency. There is a research gap in comparing data modalities, specifically signals and videos, for motion intention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to assess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the early stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average time of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the pre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed video sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy of 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction. This study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats, directing their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world construction projects.

Title: STROKEVISION-BENCH: A Multimodal Video And 2D Pose Benchmark For Tracking Stroke Recovery
Authors: David Robinson, Animesh Gupta, Rizwan Quershi, Qiushi Fu, Mubarak Shah
Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of upper extremity (UE) function after stroke largely remains subjective, relying heavily on therapist observation and coarse scoring systems. This subjectivity limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements, which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative, and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks. Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility. To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

Title: BodyWave: Egocentric Body Tracking using mmWave Radars on an MR Headset
Authors: Yin Li, Sean Korphi, Sam Shiu, Yasuo Morimoto, Jiang Zhu, Rajalakshimi Nandakumar
Abstract: Egocentric body tracking, also known as inside-out body tracking (IOBT), is an essential technology for applications like gesture control and codec avatar in mixed reality (MR), including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). However, it is more challenging than exocentric body tracking due to the limited view angles of camera-based solutions, which provide only sparse and self-occluded input from head-mounted cameras, especially for lower-body parts. To address these challenges, we propose, BodyWave, an IOBT system based on millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, which can detect non-line-of-sight. It offers low SWAP+C (size, weight, and power consumption), robustness to environmental and user factors, and enhanced privacy over camera-based solutions. Our prototype, modeled after the Meta Quest 3 form factor, places radars just 4cm away from the face, which significantly advances the practicality of radar-based IOBT. We tackle the sparsity issue of mmWave radar by processing the raw signal into high-resolution range profiles to predict fine-grained 3D coordinates of body keypoints. In a user study with 14 participants and around 500,000 frames of collected data, we achieved a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 9.85 cm on unseen users, 4.94 cm with a few minutes of user calibration, and 3.86 cm in a fully-adapted user-dependent setting. This is comparable to state-of-the-art camera-based IOBT systems, introducing a robust and privacy-preserving alternative for MR applications.

Title: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning for Medical Image Diagnosis
Authors: Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin, Longwei Wang, KC Santosh
Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from 77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical image diagnosis.

Title: Validation of a CT-brain analysis tool for measuring global cortical atrophy in older patient cohorts
Authors: Sukhdeep Bal, Emma Colbourne, Jasmine Gan, Ludovica Griffanti, Taylor Hanayik, Nele Demeyere, Jim Davies, Sarah T Pendlebury, Mark Jenkinson
Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke (OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans (ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6 for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2. Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41 between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18) or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

Title: CardioComposer: Flexible and Compositional Anatomical Structure Generation with Disentangled Geometric Guidance
Authors: Karim Kadry, Shoaib Goraya, Ajay Manicka, Abdalla Abdelwahed, Farhad Nezami, Elazer Edelman
Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators, enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component constraints during inference.

Title: Enhancing Privacy Preservation and Reducing Analysis Time with Federated Transfer Learning in Digital Twins-based Computed Tomography Scan Analysis
Authors: Avais Jan, Qasim Zia, Murray Patterson
Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL) has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis, particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm. FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed (non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

Title: Planar Juggling of a Devil-Stick using Discrete VHCs
Authors: Aakash Khandelwal, Ranjan Mukherjee
Abstract: Planar juggling of a devil-stick using impulsive inputs is addressed using the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC). The location of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation at the discrete instants when impulsive control inputs are applied. The discrete zero dynamics (DZD) resulting from the choice of DVHC provides conditions for stable juggling. A control design that enforces the DVHC and an orbit stabilizing controller are presented. The approach is validated in simulation.

Title: Admission Control for Inelastic Traffic on a Link Shared by Deadline-Driven Elastic Traffic
Authors: Patrick Kreidl
Abstract: Consider a (logical) link between two distributed data centers with available bandwidth designated for both deadline-driven elastic traffic, such as for scheduled synchronization services, and profitable inelastic traffic, such as for real-time streaming services. Admission control in this setting is cast as a stochastic shortest path problem, with state space derived from (discretization of) the elastic flow's size/deadline and action space corresponding to alternative subsets of admitted inelastic flows: the probabilistic model expresses uncertainty in both the link's available bandwidth and the inelastic flows' offered loads, while the objective function captures both congestion avoidance and the option to specify a desired minimum elastic rate. Its solution is shown to (i) balance the accumulation of instantaneous inelastic reward with the risk of missing the elastic deadline and (ii) exhibit a degree of robustness to link & flow modeling errors that is tunable via choice of the desired minimum elastic rate. Also discussed are state augmentations that befit urgent or non-interruptible inelastic traffic.

Title: Privacy Preserving Semantic Communications Using Vision Language Models: A Segmentation and Generation Approach
Authors: Haoran Chang, Mingzhe Chen, Huaxia Wang, Qianqian Zhang
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems, improving the communication efficiency by transmitting high-level semantic features. However, reliance on unimodal representations can degrade reconstruction under poor channel conditions, and privacy concerns of the semantic information attack also gain increasing attention. In this work, a privacy-preserving semantic communication framework is proposed to protect sensitive content of the image data. Leveraging a vision-language model (VLM), the proposed framework identifies and removes private content regions from input images prior to transmission. A shared privacy database enables semantic alignment between the transmitter and receiver to ensure consistent identification of sensitive entities. At the receiver, a generative module reconstructs the masked regions using learned semantic priors and conditioned on the received text embedding. Simulation results show that generalizes well to unseen image processing tasks, improves reconstruction quality at the authorized receiver by over 10% using text embedding, and reduces identity leakage to the eavesdropper by more than 50%.

Title: EnergyNet Explained: Internetification of Energy Distribution
Authors: Jonas Birgersson, Marc A. Weiss, Jimmy Chen, Daniel Kammen, Tomas Kåberger, Franklin Carrero-Martínez, Joakim Wernberg, Michael Menser, Newsha K. Ajami
Abstract: In developing EnergyNet we have leveraged and are extending lessons from telecom's shift from a centralized, circuit-switched phone system to decentralized, packet-switched data networks. EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths. The contribution is a coherent, open, and testable blueprint for software-defined, decentralized energy distribution, aligning power-systems engineering with networking principles and offering a practical route from legacy, synchronous grids to resilient, digitally routed energy distribution systems.

Title: A Linear Pricing Mechanism for Load Management in Day-Ahead Retail Energy Markets
Authors: Phillippe K. Phanivong, Duncan S. Callaway
Abstract: Regulators and utilities have been exploring hourly retail electricity pricing, with several existing programs providing day-ahead hourly pricing schedules. At the same time, customers are deploying distributed energy resources and smart energy management systems that have significant flexibility and can optimally follow price signals. In aggregate, these optimally controlled loads can create congestion management issues for distribution system operators (DSOs). In this paper, we describe a new linear pricing mechanism for day-ahead retail electricity pricing that provides a signal for customers to follow to mitigate over-consumption while still consuming energy at hours that are preferential for system performance. We show that by broadcasting a linear price designed for price-signal control of cost-optimizing loads, we can shape customer load profiles to provide congestion management without the need for bi-directional communication or customer bidding programs.

Title: A Bottom-up Framework with Language-universal Speech Attribute Modeling for Syllable-based ASR
Authors: Hao Yen, Pin-Jui Ku, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Chin-Hui Lee
Abstract: We propose a bottom-up framework for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in syllable-based languages by unifying language-universal articulatory attribute modeling with syllable-level prediction. The system first recognizes sequences or lattices of articulatory attributes that serve as a language-universal, interpretable representation of pronunciation, and then transforms them into syllables through a structured knowledge integration process. We introduce two evaluation metrics, namely Pronunciation Error Rate (PrER) and Syllable Homonym Error Rate (SHER), to evaluate the model's ability to capture pronunciation and handle syllable ambiguities. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin corpus demonstrate that the proposed bottom-up framework achieves competitive performance and exhibits better robustness under low-resource conditions compared to the direct syllable prediction model. Furthermore, we investigate the zero-shot cross-lingual transferability on Japanese and demonstrate significant improvements over character- and phoneme-based baselines by 40% error rate reduction.

Title: Multivariable Current Controller for Enhancing Dynamic Response and Grid Synchronization Stability of IBRs
Authors: Hassan Yazdani, Ali Maleki, Saeed Lotfifard, Ali Saberi
Abstract: This paper develops a multivariable current control strategy for inverter-based resources (IBRs) based on optimal control theory to enhance their dynamic performance and grid synchronization stability. The structure of the implemented multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) controller closely resembles that of the commonly used conventional single-input, single-output (SISO) PI controllers for IBRs. As a result, it requires only minor adjustments to conventional vector current control schemes, thereby facilitating its straightforward adoption. Time-domain simulations and analytical analysis demonstrate the superior performance of the developed method under various conditions and use case scenarios, such as weak power systems and uncertain parameters.

Title: Joint Optimization of Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in ISAC-assisted SAGIN-based IoT
Authors: Sooyeob Jung, Seongah Jeong, Jinkyu Kang
Abstract: In this letters, an energy-efficient integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN)-based Internet of Things (IoT) systems is proposed to facilitate wide coverage and real-time 6G services. For processing a sizable data collected at a IoT device, a hybrid edge computing scheme is applied with the cloudlets mounted at autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite, where the AAV with multiple antennas performs uplink sensing of the nearby target. With the aim of minimizing the total AAV's energy consumption, we optimize the duration of training and data phase and the bit allocation coupled with the offloading ratio under the constraints for offloading and sensing. Via simulations, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is verified to be pronounced with the sufficient mission time and the high sensing performance constraint.

Title: RTR: A Transformer-Based Lossless Crossover with Perfect Phase Alignment
Authors: Xiangying Li, Jiankuan Li, Yong Tang
Abstract: This paper proposes a transformer-based lossless crossover method, termed Resonant Transformer Router (RTR), which achieves frequency separation while ensuring perfect phase alignment between low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) channels at the crossover frequency. The core property of RTR is that its frequency responses satisfy a linear complementary relation HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1. so that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed by linear summation of the two channels. Theoretical derivation and circuit simulations demonstrate that RTR provides superior energy efficiency, phase consistency, and robustness against component tolerances. Compared with conventional LC crossovers and digital FIR/IIR filters, RTR offers a low-loss, low-latency hardware-assisted filtering solution suitable for high-fidelity audio and communication front-ends. The core theory behind this paper's work, lossless crossover, is based on a Chinese patent [CN116318117A] developed from the previous research of one of the authors, Jianluan Li. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation of this theory and propose a new extension.

Title: Context-Aware Query Refinement for Target Sound Extraction: Handling Partially Matched Queries
Authors: Ryo Sato, Chiho Haruta, Nobuhiko Hiruma, Keisuke Imoto
Abstract: Target sound extraction (TSE) is the task of extracting a target sound specified by a query from an audio mixture. Much prior research has focused on the problem setting under the Fully Matched Query (FMQ) condition, where the query specifies only active sounds present in the mixture. However, in real-world scenarios, queries may include inactive sounds that are not present in the mixture. This leads to scenarios such as the Fully Unmatched Query (FUQ) condition, where only inactive sounds are specified in the query, and the Partially Matched Query (PMQ) condition, where both active and inactive sounds are specified. Among these conditions, the performance degradation under the PMQ condition has been largely overlooked. To achieve robust TSE under the PMQ condition, we propose context-aware query refinement. This method eliminates inactive classes from the query during inference based on the estimated sound class activity. Experimental results demonstrate that while conventional methods suffer from performance degradation under the PMQ condition, the proposed method effectively mitigates this degradation and achieves high robustness under diverse query conditions.

Title: Fundamental Trade-off in Wideband Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Assisted OFDMA Systems
Authors: Zheao Li, Jiancheng An, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Conventional digital beamforming for wideband multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) demands numerous power-hungry components, increasing hardware costs and complexity. By contrast, the stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) can perform wave-based precoding at near-light speed, drastically reducing baseband overhead. However, realizing SIM-enhanced fully-analog beamforming for wideband multiuser transmissions remains challenging, as the SIM configuration has to handle interference across all subcarriers. To address this, this paper proposes a flexible subcarrier allocation strategy to fully reap the SIM-assisted fully-analog beamforming capability in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system, where each subcarrier selectively serves one or more users to balance interference mitigation and resource utilization of SIM. We propose an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment matrix and SIM transmission coefficients, approximating an interference-free channel for those selected subcarriers. Results show that the proposed system has low fitting errors yet allows each user to exploit more subcarriers. Further comparisons highlight a fundamental trade-off: our system achieves near-zero interference and robust data reliability without incurring the hardware burdens of digital precoding.

Title: Game-Theoretic Resilience Framework for Cyber-Physical Microgrids using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: S Krishna Niketh, Sagar Babu Mitikiri, V Vignesh, Vedantham Lakshmi Srinivas, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: The increasing reliance on cyber physical infrastructure in modern power systems has amplified the risk of targeted cyber attacks, necessitating robust and adaptive resilience strategies. This paper presents a mathematically rigorous game theoretic framework to evaluate and enhance microgrid resilience using a combination of quantitative resilience metrics Load Served Ratio LSR, Critical Load Resilience CLR, Topological Survivability Score TSS, and DER Resilience Score DRS. These are integrated into a unified payoff matrix using the Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP to assess attack defense interactions. The framework is formalized as a finite horizon Markov Decision Process MDP with formal convergence guarantees and computational complexity bounds. Three case studies are developed 1. static attacks analyzed via Nash equilibrium, 2. severe attacks incorporating high impact strategies, and 3. adaptive attacks using Stackelberg games, regret matching, softmax heuristics, and Multi Agent Q Learning. Rigorous theoretical analysis provides convergence proofs with explicit rates , PAC learning sample complexity bounds, and computational complexity analysis. The framework is tested on an enhanced IEEE 33bus distribution system with DERs and control switches, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive and strategic defenses in improving cyber physical resilience with statistically significant improvements of 18.7% 2.1% over static approaches.

Title: Resilient Global Practical Fixed-Time Cooperative Output Regulation of Uncertain Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems Subject to Denial-of-Service Attacks
Authors: Wenji Cao, Lu Liu, Zehua Ye, Dan Zhang, Gang Feng
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of resilient global practical fixed-time cooperative output regulation of uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to denial-of-service attacks. A novel distributed resilient adaptive fixed-time control strategy is proposed, which consists of a novel distributed resilient fixed-time observer with a chain of nonlinear filters and a novel distributed resilient adaptive fixed-time controller. It is shown that the problem of resilient global practical fixed-time cooperative output regulation can be solved by the proposed control strategy. More specifically, the proposed {distributed} control strategy ensures the global boundedness of all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system and the global convergence of the regulated outputs to a {tunable} residual set in a fixed time. A simulation example is finally provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.

Title: Physics-Guided Rectified Flow for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement
Authors: Juntai Zeng
Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image enhancement.

Title: AP-observation Automata for Abstraction-based Verification of Continuous-time Systems (Extended Version)
Authors: Sasinee Pruekprasert, Clovis Eberhart
Abstract: A key challenge in abstraction-based verification and control under complex specifications such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is that abstract models retain significantly less information than their original systems. This issue is especially true for continuous-time systems, where the system state trajectories are split into intervals of discrete actions, and satisfaction of atomic propositions is abstracted to a whole time interval. To tackle this challenge, this work introduces a novel translation from LTL specifications to AP-observation automata, a particular type of Büchi automata specifically designed for abstraction-based verification. Based on this automaton, we present a game-based verification algorithm played between the system and the environment, and an illustrative example for abstraction-based system verification under several LTL specifications.

Title: Few-shot Personalization via In-Context Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition based on Speech-Language Model
Authors: Mana Ihori, Taiga Yamane, Naotaka Kawata, Naoki Makishima, Tomohiro Tanaka, Satoshi Suzuki, Shota Orihashi, Ryo Masumura
Abstract: This paper proposes a personalization method for speech emotion recognition (SER) through in-context learning (ICL). Since the expression of emotions varies from person to person, speaker-specific adaptation is crucial for improving the SER performance. Conventional SER methods have been personalized using emotional utterances of a target speaker, but it is often difficult to prepare utterances corresponding to all emotion labels in advance. Our idea to overcome this difficulty is to obtain speaker characteristics by conditioning a few emotional utterances of the target speaker in ICL-based inference. ICL is a method to perform unseen tasks by conditioning a few input-output examples through inference in large language models (LLMs). We meta-train a speech-language model extended from the LLM to learn how to perform personalized SER via ICL. Experimental results using our newly collected SER dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods.

Title: A Planning Strategy for Building a Heterogeneous Smart EM Environment
Authors: Arianna Benoni, Marco Salucci, Baozhu Li, Andrea Massa
Abstract: This paper presents a planning strategy for the deployment of smart electromagnetic entities (SEEs) to enhance the wireless coverage and the Quality-of-Service (QoS) in large urban areas. The integration of different technological solutions such as integrated access-and-backhaul nodes (IABs), smart repeaters (SRs), and electromagnetic skins (EMSs) is here addressed to enable an effective and efficient implementation of the concept of Smart Electromagnetic Environment (SEME). By combining the features of such heterogeneous SEEs and optimizing their number, positions, orientations, and configuration, the electromagnetic (EM) coverage in a set of Regions-of-Interest (RoIs) of outdoor scenarios is recovered and/or enhanced subject to installation costs and energy consumption requirements. Numerical validations from real-world scenarios are reported to assess the effectiveness of the proposed planning scheme as well as to show the potentialities of an heterogeneous deployment of SEMEs.

Title: Fluid-Antenna-aided AAV Secure Communications in Eavesdropper Uncertain Location
Authors: Yingjie Wu, Junshan Luo, Weiyu Chen, Shilian Wang, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding
Abstract: For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.

Title: Information and Communication Theoretical Foundations of the Internet of Plants, Principles, Challenges, and Future Directions
Authors: Ahmet B. Kilic, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Plants exchange information through multiple modalities, including chemical, electrical, mycorrhizal, and acoustic signaling, which collectively support survival, defense, and adaptation. While these processes are well documented in biology, their systematic analysis from an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) perspective remains limited. To address this gap, this article is presented as a tutorial with survey elements. It provides the necessary biological background, reformulates inter-plant signaling within ICT frameworks, and surveys empirical studies to guide future research and applications. First, the paper introduces the fundamental biological processes to establish a foundation for readers in communications and networking. Building on this foundation, existing models of emission, propagation, and reception are synthesized for each modality and reformulated in terms of transmitter, channel, and receiver blocks. To complement theory, empirical studies and state-of-the-art sensing approaches are critically examined. Looking forward, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, with particular emphasis on the emerging vision of the Internet of Plants (IoP). This paradigm frames plants as interconnected nodes within ecological and technological networks, offering new opportunities for applications in precision agriculture, ecosystem monitoring, climate resilience, and bio-inspired communication systems. By integrating biological insights with ICT frameworks and projecting toward the IoP, this article provides a comprehensive tutorial on plant communication for the communications research community and establishes a foundation for interdisciplinary advances.

Title: Joint Learning using Mixture-of-Expert-Based Representation for Enhanced Speech Generation and Robust Emotion Recognition
Authors: Jing-Tong Tzeng, Carlos Busso, Chi-Chun Lee
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a critical role in building emotion-aware speech systems, but its performance degrades significantly under noisy conditions. Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.

Title: Audio Deepfake Verification
Authors: Li Wang, Junyi Ao, Linyong Gan, Yuancheng Wang, Xueyao Zhang, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: With the rapid development of deepfake technology, simply making a binary judgment of true or false on audio is no longer sufficient to meet practical needs. Accurately determining the specific deepfake method has become crucial. This paper introduces the Audio Deepfake Verification (ADV) task, effectively addressing the limitations of existing deepfake source tracing methods in closed-set scenarios, aiming to achieve open-set deepfake source tracing. Meanwhile, the Audity dual-branch architecture is proposed, extracting deepfake features from two dimensions: audio structure and generation artifacts. Experimental results show that the dual-branch Audity architecture outperforms any single-branch configuration, and it can simultaneously achieve excellent performance in both deepfake detection and verification tasks.

Title: On the Performance of ISAC over the D-Band in a Phase-Noise Aware OFDM Systems
Authors: Didem Aydogan, Mohaned Chraiti, Korkut Kaan Tokgöz
Abstract: Phase noise (PN) is a critical impairment at D-band frequencies (110 to 170 GHz), which are widely investigated as promising candidates for beyond 5G/6G ISAC systems. This paper evaluates OFDM based ISAC sensing performance under realistic oscillator impairments using a hardware-tuned 3GPP PN model at 130 GHz and FFT based radar processing. With a numerology of 480 kHz, results show that PN introduces range RMSE floors of 0.04 to 0.05 m and velocity RMSE floors of 0.12 to 0.18 m/s. Doppler sidelobe metrics also saturate, with PSLR around minus 6 dB and ISLR around minus 4 dB. These findings confirm that range accuracy remains bandwidth limited, while velocity estimation and sidelobe suppression are strongly PN-sensitive. The study highlights the importance of PN-aware waveform and numerology design for sub-THz ISAC and provides insights for future multi-band transceivers. Communication metrics and PN mitigation strategies such as PTRS and CPE tracking are left for future work.

Title: Multispectral CT Denoising via Simulation-Trained Deep Learning: Experimental Results at the ESRF BM18
Authors: Peter Gänz, Steffen Kieß, Guangpu Yang, Jajnabalkya Guhathakurta, Tanja Pienkny, Charls Clark, Paul Tafforeau, Andreas Balles, Astrid Hölzing, Simon Zabler, Sven Simon
Abstract: Multispectral computed tomography (CT) enables advanced material characterization by acquiring energy-resolved projection data. However, since the incoming X-ray flux is be distributed across multiple narrow energy bins, the photon count per bin is greatly reduced compared to standard energy-integrated imaging. This inevitably introduces substantial noise, which can either prolong acquisition times and make scan durations infeasible or degrade image quality with strong noise artifacts. To address this challenge, we present a dedicated neural network-based denoising approach tailored for multispectral CT projections acquired at the BM18 beamline of the ESRF. The method exploits redundancies across angular, spatial, and spectral domains through specialized sub-networks combined via stacked generalization and an attention mechanism. Non-local similarities in the angular-spatial domain are leveraged alongside correlations between adjacent energy bands in the spectral domain, enabling robust noise suppression while preserving fine structural details. Training was performed exclusively on simulated data replicating the physical and noise characteristics of the BM18 setup, with validation conducted on CT scans of custom-designed phantoms containing both high-Z and low-Z materials. The denoised projections and reconstructions demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality compared to classical denoising methods and baseline CNN models. Quantitative evaluations confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance across a broad spectral range, generalizing effectively to real-world experimental data while significantly reducing noise without compromising structural fidelity.

Title: Phase-Coordinated Multi-Agent Circular Formation Control with Non-Concentric Boundary Constraints
Authors: Shubham Singh, Anoop Jain
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collective circular motion control for unicycle agents, with the objective of achieving phase coordination of their velocity vectors while ensuring that their trajectories remain confined within a prescribed non-concentric circular boundary. To accommodate such nonuniform motion constraints, we build upon our earlier work and extend the use of Mobius transformation to a multi-agent framework. The Mobius transformation maps two nonconcentric circles to concentric ones, thereby converting spatially nonuniform constraints into uniform ones in the transformed plane. Leveraging this property, we introduce the notion of a phase-shifted order parameter, along with the associated concepts of Mobius phase-shift coupled synchronization and balancing, which characterize the phase-coordinated patterns studied in this paper. We establish an equivalence between the unicycle dynamics in the original and transformed planes under the Mobius transformation and its inverse, and show that synchronization is preserved across both planes, whereas balancing is generally not. Distributed control laws are then designed in the transformed plane using barrier Lyapunov functions, under the assumption of an undirected and connected communication topology among agents. These controllers are subsequently mapped back to the original plane to obtain the linear acceleration and turn-rate control inputs applied to the actual agents. Both simulations and experimental results are provided to illustrate the proposed framework.

Title: How can a geothermal storage system be optimally integrated into a local district? A case study
Authors: Ueli Schilt, Somesh Vijayananda, Sarah Schneeberger, Manuel Meyer, Santhosh Iyyakkunnel, Pascal Marc Vecsei, Philipp Schuetz
Abstract: Achieving net-zero targets requires the phase-out of fossil-based heating. A major challenge is the seasonal mismatch between renewable heat supply and demand. District heating networks often dispose of excess heat in summer and rely on fossil backups in winter. Large-scale thermal energy storage offers a solution by storing surplus summer heat for use during winter, thus reducing the need for fossil fuels. This study investigates the feasibility of a large-scale thermal storage system at a power production site that supplies a large district heating network in the city of Bern, Switzerland. Specifically, the study examines the potential of a geothermal storage system to offset fossil fuel heat generation in winter by utilising heat stored during the summer months. Using a Python-based multi-energy system model, we simulate the optimal operation of the geothermal storage system with respect to cost and emissions, considering both supply and demand on an hourly basis over one year. Multi-objective optimisation is applied to generate a Pareto-optimal front. The results show that the geothermal storage system eliminates the requirement of 8 GWh of gas-powered heat supply and increases the waste heat utilisation by 20%, therefore lowering emissions. This effect is further increased when combined with an expansion of the district heating network, as individual, emission-heavy heaters are replaced by low-emission heat from the district heating network. The findings presented in this study can prove useful when evaluating similar systems across Switzerland.

Title: CNN-ViT Hybrid for Pneumonia Detection: Theory and Empiric on Limited Data without Pretraining
Authors: Prashant Singh Basnet, Roshan Chitrakar
Abstract: This research explored the hybridization of CNN and ViT within a training dataset of limited size, and introduced a distinct class imbalance. The training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model, complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of 0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85, suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all data fractions.

Title: Modular PE-Structured Learning for Cross-Task Wireless Communications
Authors: Yuxuan Duan, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: Recent trends in learning wireless policies attempt to develop deep neural networks (DNNs) for handling multiple tasks with a single model. Existing approaches often rely on large models, which are hard to pre-train and fine-tune at the wireless edge. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by leveraging the structured knowledge of wireless problems -- specifically, permutation equivariant (PE) properties. We design three types of PE-aware modules, two of which are Transformer-style sub-layers. These modules can serve as building blocks to assemble compact DNNs applicable to the wireless policies with various PE properties. To guide the design, we analyze the hypothesis space associated with each PE property, and show that the PE-structured module assembly can boost the learning efficiency. Inspired by the reusability of the modules, we propose PE-MoFormer, a compositional DNN capable of learning a wide range of wireless policies -- including but not limited to precoding, coordinated beamforming, power allocation, and channel estimation -- with strong generalizability, low sample and space complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed modular PE-based framework outperforms relevant large model in both learning efficiency and inference time, offering a new direction for structured cross-task learning for wireless communications.

Title: RoentMod: A Synthetic Chest X-Ray Modification Model to Identify and Correct Image Interpretation Model Shortcuts
Authors: Lauren H. Cooke, Matthias Jung, Jan M. Brendel, Nora M. Kerkovits, Borek Foldyna, Michael T. Lu, Vineet K. Raghu
Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine. Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts, limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

Title: RIS-Assisted Near-Field ISAC for Multi-Target Indication in NLoS Scenarios
Authors: Hang Ruan (1), Homa Nikbakht (1 and 2), Ruizhi Zhang (1 and 3), Honglei Chen (4), Yonina C. Eldar (1) ((1) Weizmann Institute of Science, (2) Princeton University, (3) University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, (4) MathWorks, Inc.)
Abstract: Enabling multi-target sensing in near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems is a key challenge, particularly when line-of-sight paths are blocked. This paper proposes a beamforming framework that leverages a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve multi-target indication. Our contribution is the extension of classic beampattern gain and inter-target cross-correlation metrics to the near-field, leveraging both angle and distance information to discriminate between multiple users and targets. We formulate a problem to maximize the worst-case sensing performance by jointly designing the beamforming at the base station and the phase shifts at the RIS, while guaranteeing communication rates. The non-convex problem is solved via an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that utilizes semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulations demonstrate that our RIS-assisted framework enables high-resolution sensing of co-angle targets in blocked scenarios.

Title: Analysis and Control of Acoustic Emissions from Marine Energy Converters
Authors: Jiaqin He, Max Malyi, Jonathan Shek
Abstract: This study investigates the mitigation of acoustic emissions from tidal current converters (TCCs) through optimized control strategies to enhance power generation efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts on marine life. A MATLAB/Simulink-based model of a Tidal Current Conversion System (TCCS) was developed to simulate the effects of variable control parameters, including switching frequencies, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) coefficients, and the elimination of the gearbox, on underwater noise levels. Acoustic emissions were quantified in terms of sound pressure levels (SPLs), and their potential impacts on marine mammals and fish were evaluated against species-specific auditory thresholds for temporary and permanent hearing threshold shifts. The results indicate that adjusting control parameters can significantly reduce SPLs, with the removal of the gearbox yielding the greatest noise reduction. The study identifies operational conditions under which marine species are at risk of auditory damage and proposes control strategies to mitigate these risks without compromising energy output. These findings contribute to the understanding of how control system modifications can balance the efficiency of marine energy systems with ecological considerations, offering guidance for the design and operation of environmentally compliant TCCs.

Title: Universal Graph Learning for Power System Reconfigurations: Transfer Across Topology Variations
Authors: Tong Wu, Anna Scaglione, Sandy Miguel, Daniel Arnold
Abstract: This work addresses a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to power systems: developing neural network models that transfer across significant system changes, including networks with entirely different topologies and dimensionalities, without requiring training data from unseen reconfigurations. Despite extensive research, most ML-based approaches remain system-specific, limiting real-world deployment. This limitation stems from a dual barrier. First, topology changes shift feature distributions and alter input dimensions due to power flow physics. Second, reconfigurations redefine output semantics and dimensionality, requiring models to handle configuration-specific outputs while maintaining transferable feature extraction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Universal Graph Convolutional Network (UGCN) that achieves transferability to any reconfiguration or variation of existing power systems without any prior knowledge of new grid topologies or retraining during implementation. Our approach applies to both transmission and distribution networks and demonstrates generalization capability to completely unseen system reconfigurations, such as network restructuring and major grid expansions. Experimental results across power system applications, including false data injection detection and state forecasting, show that UGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-system zero-shot transferability of new reconfigurations.

Title: Deep Unrolling of Sparsity-Induced RDO for 3D Point Cloud Attribute Coding
Authors: Tam Thuc Do, Philip A. Chou, Gene Cheung
Abstract: Given encoded 3D point cloud geometry available at the decoder, we study the problem of lossy attribute compression in a multi-resolution B-spline projection framework. A target continuous 3D attribute function is first projected onto a sequence of nested subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{L}$, where $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l}$ is a family of functions spanned by a B-spline basis function of order $p$ at a chosen scale and its integer shifts. The projected low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$ are computed by variable-complexity unrolling of a rate-distortion (RD) optimization algorithm into a feed-forward network, where the rate term is the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm. Thus, the projection operation is end-to-end differentiable. For a chosen coarse-to-fine predictor, the coefficients are then adjusted to account for the prediction from a lower-resolution to a higher-resolution, which is also optimized in a data-driven manner.

Title: Spatial-Spectral Chromatic Coding of Interference Signatures in SAR Imagery: Signal Modeling and Physical-Visual Interpretation
Authors: Huizhang Yang, Chengzhi Chen, Liyuan Chen, Zhongling Huang, Zhong Liu, Jian Yang
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are conventionally visualized as grayscale amplitude representations, which often fail to explicitly reveal interference characteristics caused by external radio emitters and unfocused signals. This paper proposes a novel spatial-spectral chromatic coding method for visual analysis of interference patterns in single-look complex (SLC) SAR imagery. The method first generates a series of spatial-spectral images via spectral subband decomposition that preserve both spatial structures and spectral signatures. These images are subsequently chromatically coded into a color representation using RGB/HSV dual-space coding, using a set of specifically designed color palette. This method intrinsically encodes the spatial-spectral properties of interference into visually discernible patterns, enabling rapid visual interpretation without additional processing. To facilitate physical interpretation, mathematical models are established to theoretically analyze the physical mechanisms of responses to various interference types. Experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the method effectively highlights interference regions and unfocused echo or signal responses (e.g., blurring, ambiguities, and moving target effects), providing analysts with a practical tool for visual interpretation, quality assessment, and data diagnosis in SAR imagery.

Title: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer Layer Caching
Authors: Siratish Sakpiboonchit
Abstract: This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining.

Title: CSI Compression Beyond Latents: End-to-End Hybrid Attention-CNN Networks with Entropy Regularization
Authors: Maryam Ansarifard, Mostafa Rahmani, Mohit K. Sharma, Kishor C. Joshi, George Exarchakos, Alister Burr
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems rely on accurate Channel State Information (CSI) feedback to enable high-gain beam- forming. However, the feedback overhead scales linearly with the number of antennas, presenting a major bottleneck. While recent deep learning methods have improved CSI compres- sion, most overlook the impact of quantization and entropy coding, limiting their practical deployability. In this work, we propose an end-to-end CSI compression framework that inte- grates a Spatial Correlation-Guided Attention Mechanism with quantization and entropy-aware training. Our model effectively exploits the spatial correlation among the antennas, thereby learning compact, entropy-optimized latent representations for efficient coding. This reduces the required feedback bitrates without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy, thereby yielding a superior rate-distortion trade-off. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing end-to-end CSI compression schemes, exceeding benchmark performance by an average of 21.5% on indoor datasets and 18.9% on outdoor datasets. The proposed framework results in a practical and efficient CSI feedback scheme.

Title: Recursive Aperture Decoded Ultrasound Imaging (READI) With Estimated Motion-Compensated Compounding (EMC2)
Authors: Tyler Keith Henry, Darren Dahunsi, Randy Palamar, Negar Majidi, Mohammad Rahim Sobhani, Roger Zemp
Abstract: Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) is a Hadamard-encoded Synthetic Transmit Aperture (STA) imaging sequence using bias-sensitive Top-Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) arrays. It produces images with a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and improved penetration depth compared to traditional STA techniques, but suffers from motion sensitivity due to ensemble size and aperture encoding. This work presents Recursive Aperture Decoded Ultrasound Imaging (READI), a novel decoding and beamforming technique for FORCES that produces multiple low-resolution images out of subsets of the FORCES sequence that are less susceptible to motion, but sum to form the complete FORCES image. Estimated Motion-Compensated Compounding (EMC2) describes the process of comparing these low-resolution images to estimate the underlying motion, then warping them to align before coherent compounding. READI with EMC2 is shown to fully recover images corrupted by probe motion, and restore tissue speckle and sharpness to an image of a beating heart. READI low-resolution images by themselves are demonstrated to be a marked improvement over sparse STA schemes with the same transmit count, and are shown to recover blood speckle at a flow rate of 42 cm/s.

Title: Distributed Unknown Input Observer Design with Relaxed Conditions: Theory and Application to Vehicle Platooning
Authors: Ruixuan Zhao, Guitao Yang, Thomas Parisini, Boli Chen
Abstract: Designing observers for linear systems with both known and unknown inputs is an important problem in several research contexts, for example, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control, and cyber-secure control systems, and presents significant challenges in distributed state estimation due to the limited sensing capabilities of individual nodes. Existing methods typically impose an individual input-to-output rank condition on each estimator node, which severely restricts applicability in practical applications. This paper presents a novel distributed unknown-input observer design scheme based on a geometric approach under much weaker assumptions than the ones available in the literature. By leveraging the properties of the $(C, A)$-invariant (conditioned invariant) subspace at each node, our methodology aims at reconstructing portions of the system state that remain unaffected by local unknown inputs, while integrating these estimates via a network-based information exchange. A case study on vehicle platoon control shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Low-Cost and Detunable Wireless Resonator Glasses for Enhanced Eye MRI with Concurrent High-Quality Whole Brain MRI
Authors: Ming Lu, Xiaoyue Yang, Jason Moore, Pingping Li, Adam W. Anderson, John C. Gore, Seth A. Smith, Xinqiang Yan
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a wearable wireless resonator glasses design that enhances eye MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without compromising whole-brain image quality at 7 T. Methods: The device integrates two detunable LC loop resonators into a lightweight, 3D-printed frame positioned near the eyes. The resonators passively couple to a standard 2Tx/32Rx head coil without hardware modifications. Bench tests assessed tuning, isolation, and detuning performance. B1$^+$ maps were measured in a head/shoulder phantom, and SNR maps were obtained in both phantom and in vivo experiments. Results: Bench measurements confirmed accurate tuning, strong inter-element isolation, and effective passive detuning. Phantom B1$^+$ mapping showed negligible differences between configurations with and without the resonators. Phantom and in vivo imaging demonstrated up to about a 3-fold SNR gain in the eye region, with no measurable SNR loss in the brain. Conclusion: The wireless resonator glasses provide a low-cost, easy-to-use solution that improves ocular SNR while preserving whole-brain image quality, enabling both dedicated eye MRI and simultaneous eye-brain imaging at ultrahigh field.

Title: LALM-Eval: An Open-Source Toolkit for Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Sidharth Surapaneni, Hoang Nguyen, Jash Mehta, Aman Tiwari, Oluwanifemi Bamgbose, Akshay Kalkunte, Sai Rajeswar, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are rapidly advancing, but evaluating them remains challenging due to inefficient toolkits that limit fair comparison and systematic assessment. Current frameworks suffer from three critical issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM development.

Title: Online Learning and Coverage of Unknown Fields Using Random-Feature Gaussian Processes
Authors: Ruijie Du, Ruoyu Lin, Yanning Shen, Magnus Egerstedt
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform simultaneous learning and coverage of the domain of interest characterized by an unknown and potentially time-varying density function. To overcome the limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP (RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) that enables online and incremental inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient coverage. Under mild assumptions, we provide theoretical guarantees and evaluate the framework through simulations in time-invariant scenarios. Furthermore, its effectiveness in time-varying settings is demonstrated through additional simulations and a physical experiment.

Title: UTM Performance Under Stressing Scenarios
Authors: Ian Jessen
Abstract: Proliferation of new classes of airspace participants, including uncrewed and advanced aerial mobility vehicles, necessitates the development and deployment of novel airspace management solutions, such as the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) system and the Provider of Services to UAM (PSU) Network. The efficacy of such systems has been demonstrated on multiple occasions via real-world deployments in limited test environments, however exploration of system behavior under stressing conditions requires the development of appropriate modeling and simulation (M&S) environments. Autonomy Networks for Advanced Mobility at Lincoln Laboratory (ANAMLL) is a virtual Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) designed to host federated autonomy networks, such as a UTM or PSU Network, and to enable test and validation at scales not available in real-world deployments. As an example of ANAMLL's utility, we explore the performance of a representative UTM network during a stressing demand scenario. In a close examination of the demand scenario, ANAMLL demonstrates a UTM system demand point at which in-flight replanning can no longer be accomplished within an allowable time window. In a second analysis of the same scenario, ANAMLL demonstrates the impact of network connectivity performance on end-user airspace access.

Title: RAPID Quantum Detection and Demodulation of Covert Communications: Breaking the Noise Limit with Solid-State Spin Sensors
Authors: Amirhossein Taherpour, Abbas Taherpour, Tamer Khattab
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for the detection and demodulation of covert electromagnetic signals using solid-state spin sensors. Our approach, named RAPID, is a two-stage hybrid strategy that leverages nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to operate below the classical noise floor employing a robust adaptive policy via imitation and distillation. We first formulate the joint detection and estimation task as a unified stochastic optimal control problem, optimizing a composite Bayesian risk objective under realistic physical constraints. The RAPID algorithm solves this by first computing a robust, non-adaptive baseline protocol grounded in the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), and then using this baseline to warm-start an online, adaptive policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic). This method dynamically optimizes control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement bases to maximize information gain while actively suppressing non-Markovian noise and decoherence. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol achieves a significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and, when applied to sensor arrays, enables coherent quantum beamforming that achieves Heisenberg-like scaling in precision. This work establishes a theoretically rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in security-critical applications such as electronic warfare and covert surveillance.

Title: Sample-Efficient Online Control Policy Learning with Real-Time Recursive Model Updates
Authors: Zixin Zhang, James Avtges, Todd D. Murphey
Abstract: Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight, especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited -- such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis -- requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance C++ codebase is open-sourced. Website: this https URL.

Title: Behaviorally Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Exploration Using Distributed Task Allocation
Authors: Nirabhra Mandal, Aamodh Suresh, Carlos Nieto-Granda, Sonia Martínez
Abstract: We study a problem of multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous robots. Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution). For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards. We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence) in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy, and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.

Title: Real-world Music Plagiarism Detection With Music Segment Transcription System
Authors: Seonghyeon Go
Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR technologies. We developed a music segment transcription system that extracts musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP) dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are publicly available.

Title: Behind the Scenes: Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-adapted Whisper for Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yujian Ma, Jinqiu Sang, Ruizhe Li
Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition (SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment, backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable adaptation strategies in large speech models.

Title: SKYLINK: Scalable and Resilient Link Management in LEO Satellite Network
Authors: Wanja de Sombre, Arash Asadi, Debopam Bhattacherjee, Deepak Vasisht, Andrea Ortiz
Abstract: The rapid growth of space-based services has established LEO satellite networks as a promising option for global broadband connectivity. Next-generation LEO networks leverage inter-satellite links (ISLs) to provide faster and more reliable communications compared to traditional bent-pipe architectures, even in remote regions. However, the high mobility of satellites, dynamic traffic patterns, and potential link failures pose significant challenges for efficient and resilient routing. To address these challenges, we model the LEO satellite network as a time-varying graph comprising a constellation of satellites and ground stations. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of average delay and packet drop rate. Each satellite independently decides how to distribute its incoming traffic to neighboring nodes in real time. Given the infeasibility of finding optimal solutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and uncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed learning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK enables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions, ensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and resilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead and computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global scale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For 25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop rate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to Dijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99% relative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while achieving up to 46% higher throughput. At the same time, SKYLINK maintains constant computational complexity with respect to constellation size.

Title: Robustness of quantum algorithms: Worst-case fidelity bounds and implications for design
Authors: Julian Berberich, Tobias Fellner, Robert L. Kosut, Christian Holm
Abstract: Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design. In this paper, we develop an alternative, algorithm-centered framework for understanding and improving the robustness against errors. For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be explicitly computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. Numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization demonstrate the practicality of the framework.

Title: FMT$^{x}$: An Efficient and Asymptotically Optimal Extension of the Fast Marching Tree for Dynamic Replanning
Authors: Soheil Espahbodini Nia
Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics, especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree (FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation, enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path, FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable worlds.

Title: Optimal control of stochastic networks of $M/M/\infty$ queues with linear costs
Authors: Giovanni Pugliese Carratelli, Ioannis Lestas
Abstract: We consider an arbitrary network of $M/M/\infty$ queues with controlled transitions between queues. We consider optimal control problems where the costs are linear functions of the state and inputs over a finite or infinite horizon. We provide in both cases an explicit characterization of the optimal control policies. We also show that these do not involve state feedback, but they depend on the network topology and system parameters. The results are also illustrated with various examples.

Title: Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations
Authors: Ron F. Del Rosario, Klaudia Krawiecka, Christian Schroeder de Witt
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.

Title: TANGO: Traversability-Aware Navigation with Local Metric Control for Topological Goals
Authors: Stefan Podgorski, Sourav Garg, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Lachlan Mares, Feras Dayoub, Ian Reid
Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments.

Title: PianoVAM: A Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset
Authors: Yonghyun Kim, Junhyung Park, Joonhyung Bae, Kirak Kim, Taegyun Kwon, Alexander Lerch, Juhan Nam
Abstract: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR) community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels, and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions, alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos. Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential applications.

Title: MF-PAM: Accurate Pitch Estimation through Periodicity Analysis and Multi-level Feature Fusion
Authors: Woo-Jin Chung, Doyeon Kim, Soo-Whan Chung, Hong-Goo Kang
Abstract: We introduce Multi-level feature Fusion-based Periodicity Analysis Model (MF-PAM), a novel deep learning-based pitch estimation model that accurately estimates pitch trajectory in noisy and reverberant acoustic environments. Our model leverages the periodic characteristics of audio signals and involves two key steps: extracting pitch periodicity using periodic non-periodic convolution (PNP-Conv) blocks and estimating pitch by aggregating multi-level features using a modified bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN). We evaluate our model on speech and music datasets and achieve superior pitch estimation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while using fewer model parameters. Our model achieves 99.20 % accuracy in pitch estimation on a clean musical dataset. Overall, our proposed model provides a promising solution for accurate pitch estimation in challenging acoustic environments and has potential applications in audio signal processing.

Title: Downlink MIMO Channel Estimation from Bits: Recoverability and Algorithm
Authors: Rajesh Shrestha, Mingjie Shao, Mingyi Hong, Wing-Kin Ma, Xiao Fu
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, a major challenge lies in acquiring the downlink channel state information}\ (CSI) at the base station (BS) from limited feedback sent by the user equipment (UE). To tackle this fundamental task, our contribution is twofold: First, a simple feedback framework is proposed, where a compression and Gaussian dithering-based quantization strategy is adopted at the UE side, and then a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated at the BS side. Recoverability of the MIMO channel under the widely used double directional model is established. Specifically, analyses are presented for two compression schemes -- showing one being more overhead-economical and the other computationally lighter at the UE side. Second, to realize the MLE, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is carefully designed to integrate a sophisticated harmonic retrieval (HR) solver as subroutine, which turns out to be the key of effectively tackling this hard MLE this http URL numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our approach.

Title: Multi-target Range, Doppler and Angle estimation in MIMO-FMCW Radar with Limited Measurements
Authors: Chandrashekhar Rai, Himali Singh, Arpan Chattopadhyay
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar offers several performance and flexibility advantages over traditional radar arrays. However, high angular and Doppler resolutions necessitate a large number of antenna elements and the transmission of numerous chirps, leading to increased hardware and computational complexity. While compressive sensing (CS) has recently been applied to pulsed-waveform radars with sparse measurements, its application to frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for target detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CS-based multi-target localization algorithm in the range, Doppler, and angular domains for MIMO-FMCW radar, where we jointly estimate targets' velocities and angles of arrival. To this end, we present a signal model for sparse-random and uniform linear arrays based on three-dimensional spectral estimation. For range estimation, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based focusing and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based techniques, each with distinct advantages, while two-dimensional CS is used for joint Doppler-angle estimation. Leveraging the properties of structured random matrices, we establish theoretical uniform and non-uniform recovery guarantees with high probability for the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve similar detection performance and higher resolution compared to conventional DFT and MUSIC with fewer transmitted chirps and antenna elements.

Title: Convergence Guarantees of Model-free Policy Gradient Methods for LQR with Stochastic Data
Authors: Bowen Song, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are the backbone of many reinforcement learning algorithms due to their good performance in policy optimization problems. As a gradient-based approach, PG methods typically rely on knowledge of the system dynamics. If this is not available, trajectory data can be utilized to approximate first-order information. When the data are noisy, gradient estimates become inaccurate and a study that investigates uncertainty estimation and the analysis of its propagation through the algorithm is currently missing. To address this, our work focuses on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem for systems subject to additive stochastic noise. After briefly summarizing the state of the art for cases with a known model, we focus on scenarios where the system dynamics are unknown, and approximate gradient information is obtained using zeroth-order optimization techniques. We analyze the theoretical properties by computing the error in the estimated gradient and examining how this error affects the convergence of PG algorithms. Additionally, we provide global convergence guarantees for various versions of PG methods, including those employing adaptive step sizes and variance reduction techniques, which help increase the convergence rate and reduce sample complexity. This study contributed to characterizing robustness of the study of the robustness of model-free PG methods, aiming to identify their limitations in the presence of stochastic noise and proposing improvements to enhance their applicability.

Title: A New Interpretation of the Time-Interleaved ADC Mismatch Problem: A Tracking-Based Hybrid Calibration Approach
Authors: Jiwon Sung, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: Time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs) achieve high sampling rates by interleaving multiple sub-ADCs in parallel. Mismatch errors between the sub-ADCs, however, can significantly degrade the signal quality, which is a main performance bottleneck. This paper presents a hybrid calibration approach by interpreting the mismatch problem as a tracking problem, and uses the extended Kalman filter for online estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. After estimation, the desired signal is reconstructed using a truncated fractional delay filter and a high-pass filter. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms the existing hybrid calibration method in both mismatch estimation and compensation.

Title: Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents share inaccurate state information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.

Title: Modeling Micro-Doppler Signature of Multi-Propeller Drones in Distributed ISAC
Authors: Heraldo Cesar Alves Costa, Saw J. Myint, Carsten Andrich, Sebastian W. Giehl, Maximilian Engelhardt, Christian Schneider, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) will be one key feature of future 6G networks, enabling simultaneous communication and radar sensing. The radar sensing geometry of ISAC will be multistatic since that corresponds to the common distributed structure of a mobile communication network. Within this framework, micro-Doppler analysis plays a vital role in classifying targets based on their micromotions, such as rotating propellers, vibration, or moving limbs. However, research on bistatic micro-Doppler effects, particularly in ISAC systems utilizing OFDM waveforms, remains limited. Existing methods, including electromagnetic simulations, often lack scalability for generating the large datasets required to train machine learning algorithms. To address this gap, this work introduces an OFDM-based bistatic micro-Doppler model for multi-propeller drones. The proposed model adapts the classic thin-wire model to include bistatic sensing configuration with an OFDM-like signal. Then, it extends further by incorporating multiple propellers and integrating the reflectivity of the drone's static parts. Measurements were performed to collect ground truth data for verification of the proposed model. Validation results show that the model generates micro-Doppler signatures closely resembling those obtained from measurements, demonstrating its potential as a tool for data generation. In addition, it offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing bistatic micro-Doppler effects.

Title: A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech
Authors: Simon Geirnaert, Simon L. Kappel, Preben Kidmose
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.

Title: A Compact Dynamic Antenna for Physical Layer Wireless Security
Authors: Sheng Huang, Jacob R. Randall, Cory Hilton, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a $360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration. To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna system.

Title: Power-Gas Infrastructure Planning under Weather-induced Supply and Demand Uncertainties
Authors: Rahman Khorramfar, Dharik Mallapragada, Saurabh Amin
Abstract: Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.

Title: A Unified Transformer Architecture for Low-Latency and Scalable Wireless Signal Processing
Authors: Yuto Kawai, Rajeev Koodli
Abstract: We propose a unified Transformer-based architecture for wireless signal processing tasks, offering a low-latency, task-adaptive alternative to conventional receiver pipelines. Unlike traditional modular designs, our model integrates channel estimation, interpolation, and demapping into a single, compact attention-driven architecture designed for real-time deployment. The model's structure allows dynamic adaptation to diverse output formats by simply modifying the final projection layer, enabling consistent reuse across receiver subsystems. Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization to varying user counts, modulation schemes, and pilot configurations, while satisfying latency constraints imposed by practical systems. The architecture is evaluated across three core use cases: (1) an End-to-End Receiver, which replaces the entire baseband processing pipeline from pilot symbols to bit-level decisions; (2) Channel Frequency Interpolation, implemented and tested within a 3GPP-compliant OAI+Aerial system; and (3) Channel Estimation, where the model infers full-band channel responses from sparse pilot observations. In all cases, our approach outperforms classical baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work presents a deployable, data-driven alternative to hand-engineered PHY-layer blocks, and lays the foundation for intelligent, software-defined signal processing in next-generation wireless communication systems.

Title: RadHARSimulator V1: Model-Based FMCW Radar Human Activity Recognition Simulator
Authors: Weicheng Gao
Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a pivotal research area for applications requiring non-invasive monitoring. However, the acquisition of diverse and high-fidelity radar datasets for robust algorithm development remains a significant challenge. To overcome this bottleneck, a model-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar HAR simulator is developed. The simulator integrates an anthropometrically scaled $13$-scatterer kinematic model to simulate $12$ distinct activities. The FMCW radar echo model is employed, which incorporates dynamic radar cross-section (RCS), free-space or through-the-wall propagation, and a calibrated noise floor to ensure signal fidelity. The simulated raw data is then processed through a complete pipeline, including moving target indication (MTI), bulk Doppler compensation, and Savitzky-Golay denoising, culminating in the generation of high-resolution range-time map (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTMs) via both short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform (FSST). Finally, a novel neural network method is proposed to validate the effectiveness of the radar HAR. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the simulator successfully generates high-fidelity and distinct micro-Doppler signature, which provides a valuable tool for radar HAR algorithm design and validation. The installer of this simulator is released at: this https URL.

Title: Joint Optimization of Energy Consumption and Completion Time in Federated Learning
Authors: Xinyu Zhou, Jun Zhao, Huimei Han, Claude Guet
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.

Title: Using topological data analysis to compare inter-subject variability across resting state functional MRI brain representations
Authors: Ty Easley, Kevin Freese, Elizabeth Munch, Janine Bijsterbosch
Abstract: In neuroimaging, extensive post-processing of resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data is necessary for its application and investigation in relation to brain-behavior associations. Such post-processing is used to derive brain representations, lower dimensional feature sets used for brain-behavior association studies. A brain representation involves a choice of dimension reduction (a parcellation into regions or networks) and a choice of feature type, such as spatial topography, connectivity matrix, amplitude. However, widespread variability in rfMRI brain representations has hindered both reproducibility and knowledge accumulation across the field. Brain representation choice effects measurements of inter-subject variability, which muddies the comparison and integration of findings. We leveraged persistent homology on the subject-space topologies induced by 34 different brain representations to enable direct comparison of brain representations in the context of individual differences. Our findings reveal the importance of considering feature type when comparing results derived from different brain representations, suggesting best practices for assessing the replicability and generalizability of brain-behavior research in rfMRI data.

Title: Guiding Soft Robots with Motor-Imagery Brain Signals and Impedance Control
Authors: Maximilian Stölzle, Sonal Santosh Baberwal, Daniela Rus, Shirley Coyle, Cosimo Della Santina
Abstract: Integrating Brain-Machine Interfaces into non-clinical applications like robot motion control remains difficult - despite remarkable advancements in clinical settings. Specifically, EEG-based motor imagery systems are still error-prone, posing safety risks when rigid robots operate near humans. This work presents an alternative pathway towards safe and effective operation by combining wearable EEG with physically embodied safety in soft robots. We introduce and test a pipeline that allows a user to move a soft robot's end effector in real time via brain waves that are measured by as few as three EEG channels. A robust motor imagery algorithm interprets the user's intentions to move the position of a virtual attractor to which the end effector is attracted, thanks to a new Cartesian impedance controller. We specifically focus here on planar soft robot-based architected metamaterials, which require the development of a novel control architecture to deal with the peculiar nonlinearities - e.g., non-affinity in control. We preliminarily but quantitatively evaluate the approach on the task of setpoint regulation. We observe that the user reaches the proximity of the setpoint in 66% of steps and that for successful steps, the average response time is 21.5s. We also demonstrate the execution of simple real-world tasks involving interaction with the environment, which would be extremely hard to perform if it were not for the robot's softness.

Title: Alternating Minimization Schemes for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions with $f$-Divergence Perception Constraints
Authors: Giuseppe Serra, Photios A. Stavrou, Marios Kountouris
Abstract: We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of $f$-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration's structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.

Title: Neural-Enhanced Dynamic Range Compression Inversion: A Hybrid Approach for Restoring Audio Dynamics
Authors: Haoran Sun, Dominique Fourer, Hichem Maaref
Abstract: Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) is a widely used audio effect that adjusts signal dynamics for applications in music production, broadcasting, and speech processing. Inverting DRC is of broad importance for restoring the original dynamics, enabling remixing, and enhancing the overall audio quality. Existing DRC inversion methods either overlook key parameters or rely on precise parameter values, which can be challenging to estimate accurately. To address this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines model-based DRC inversion with neural networks to achieve robust DRC parameter estimation and audio restoration simultaneously. Our method uses tailored neural network architectures (classification and regression), which are then integrated into a model-based inversion framework to reconstruct the original signal. Experimental evaluations on various music and speech datasets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: QR-VC: Leveraging Quantization Residuals for Linear Disentanglement in Zero-Shot Voice Conversion
Authors: Youngjun Sim, Jinsung Yoon, Wooyeol Jeong, Young-Joo Suh
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion is a technique that alters the speaker identity of an input speech to match a target speaker using only a single reference utterance, without requiring additional training. Recent approaches extensively utilize self-supervised learning features with K-means quantization to extract high-quality content representations while removing speaker identity. However, this quantization process also eliminates fine-grained phonetic and prosodic variations, degrading intelligibility and prosody preservation. While prior works have primarily focused on quantized representations, quantization residuals remain underutilized and deserve further exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that fully utilizes quantization residuals by leveraging temporal properties of speech components. This facilitates the disentanglement of speaker identity and the recovery of phonetic and prosodic details lost during quantization. By applying only K-means quantization and linear projections, our method achieves simple yet effective disentanglement, without requiring complex architectures or explicit supervision. This allows for high-fidelity voice conversion trained solely with reconstruction losses. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics. It achieves superior intelligibility and speaker similarity, along with improved prosody preservation, highlighting the impact of our Linear Disentangler module.

Title: Beyond Diagonal RIS in Multiuser MIMO: Graph Theoretic Modeling and Optimal Architectures with Low Complexity
Authors: Zheyu Wu, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system? By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance--matching that of fully-connected RIS--while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is ${O}(N\min\{D,N/2\})$, where $N$ denotes the number of RIS elements and $D$ is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since $D$ is much smaller than $N$ in practice, the complexity scales as ${O}(ND)$, which is substantially lower than the ${O}(N^2)$ complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures--band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS--and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures.

Title: Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Arbitrary Correlations Among the Codes
Authors: Brian Nelson, Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny
Abstract: The use of non-orthogonal signals has several benefits over orthogonal signals in multi-coded communications. We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities. We show that by combining these techniques, the error probability can be efficiently computed across the full SNR regime. Finally, we use the upper bound of the error probability to develop some analytical insights about the impacts of non-orthogonality among the code vectors on the symbol error probability.

Title: TransitReID: Transit OD Data Collection with Occlusion-Resistant Dynamic Passenger Re-Identification
Authors: Kaicong Huang, Talha Azfar, Jack Reilly, Ruimin Ke
Abstract: Transit Origin-Destination (OD) data are fundamental for optimizing public transit services, yet current collection methods, such as manual surveys, Bluetooth and WiFi tracking, or Automated Passenger Counters, are either costly, device-dependent, or incapable of individual-level matching. Meanwhile, onboard surveillance cameras already deployed on most transit vehicles provide an underutilized opportunity for automated OD data collection. Leveraging this, we present TransitReID, a novel framework for individual-level and occlusion-resistant passenger re-identification tailored to transit environments. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) an occlusion-robust ReID algorithm that integrates a variational autoencoder-guided region-attention mechanism and selective quality feature averaging to dynamically emphasize visible and discriminative body regions under severe occlusions and viewpoint variations; (2) a Hierarchical Storage and Dynamic Matching HSDM mechanism that transforms static gallery matching into a dynamic process for robustness, accuracy, and speed in real-world bus operations; and (3) a multi-threaded edge implementation that enables near real-time OD estimation while ensuring privacy by processing all data locally. To support research in this domain, we also construct a new TransitReID dataset with over 17,000 images captured from bus front and rear cameras under diverse occlusion and viewpoint conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that TransitReID achieves state-of-the-art performance, with R-1 accuracy of 88.3 percent and mAP of 92.5 percent, and further sustains 90 percent OD estimation accuracy in bus route simulations on NVIDIA Jetson edge devices. This work advances both the algorithmic and system-level foundations of automated transit OD collection, paving the way for scalable, privacy-preserving deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Title: Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach
Authors: Van Sy Mai, Abderrahim Amlou, Amar Abane, Abdella Battou
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.

Title: Memory-Anchored Multimodal Reasoning for Explainable Video Forensics
Authors: Chen Chen, Runze Li, Zejun Zhang, Pukun Zhao, Fanqing Zhou, Longxiang Wang, Haojian Huang
Abstract: We address multimodal deepfake detection requiring both robustness and interpretability by proposing FakeHunter, a unified framework that combines memory guided retrieval, a structured Observation-Thought-Action reasoning loop, and adaptive forensic tool invocation. Visual representations from a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model and audio representations from a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model retrieve semantically aligned authentic exemplars from a large scale memory, providing contextual anchors that guide iterative localization and explanation of suspected manipulations. Under low internal confidence the framework selectively triggers fine grained analyses such as spatial region zoom and mel spectrogram inspection to gather discriminative evidence instead of relying on opaque marginal scores. We also release X-AVFake, a comprehensive audio visual forgery benchmark with fine grained annotations of manipulation type, affected region or entity, reasoning category, and explanatory justification, designed to stress contextual grounding and explanation fidelity. Extensive experiments show that FakeHunter surpasses strong multimodal baselines, and ablation studies confirm that both contextual retrieval and selective tool activation are indispensable for improved robustness and explanatory precision.

Title: Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise
Authors: Nader Shakibay Senobari
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.

Title: Computational Concept of the Psyche (in Russian)
Authors: Anton Kolonin, Vladimir Kryukov
Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.
