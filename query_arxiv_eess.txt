Title: CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Mingxiu Cai, Hanxiao Wang, Gaochang Wu, Tianyou Chai, Xiatian Zhu
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: A Decision-Focused Predict-then-Bid Framework for Strategic Energy Storage
Authors: Ming Yi, Yiqian Wu, Saud Alghumayjan, James Anderson, Bolun Xu
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel decision-focused framework for energy storage arbitrage bidding. Inspired by the bidding process for energy storage in electricity markets, we propose a "predict-then-bid" end-to-end method incorporating the storage arbitrage optimization and market clearing this http URL is achieved through a tri-layer framework that combines a price prediction layer with a two-stage optimization problem: an energy storage optimization layer and a market-clearing optimization layer. We leverage the implicit function theorem for gradient computation in the first optimization layer and incorporate a perturbation-based approach into the decision-focused loss function to ensure differentiability in the market-clearing layer. Numerical experiments using electricity market data from New York demonstrate that our bidding design substantially outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest profits and showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Ranging of a Moving Ship Using a Single Acoustic Receiver in Shallow Water
Authors: Junsu Jang, William S Hodgkiss, Florian Meyer
Abstract: Passive acoustics is a versatile tool for maritime situational awareness, enabling applications such as source detection and localization, marine mammal tracking, and geoacoustic inversion. This study focuses on estimating the range between an acoustic receiver and a transiting ship in an acoustically range-independent shallow water environment. Here, acoustic propagation can be modeled by a set of normal modes that are determined by the shallow water waveguide and seabed characteristics. These modes are dispersive, with phase and group velocities varying with frequency, and their interference produces striation patterns that depend on range and frequency in single-hydrophone spectrograms. These patterns can often be characterized by the waveguide invariant, a single parameter describing the waveguide's properties. This paper presents a statistical waveguide invariant-based range estimation approach using a single hydrophone, leveraging broadband and tonal sounds from a transiting ship. Using data from the Seabed Characterization Experiment 2017 (SBCEX17), a large commercial ship's radiated acoustic signature within a 7 Hz bandwidth was processed to estimate its range up to 45 km with errors below three percent.

Title: A Coordinated Routing Approach for Enhancing Bus Timeliness and Travel Efficiency in Mixed-Traffic Environment
Authors: Tanlu Liang, Ting Bai, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated routing strategy aimed at improving bus schedule adherence and enhancing travel efficiency for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating within a mixed-traffic urban network. Our approach capitalizes on the existence of dedicated lanes for buses and CAVs, leveraging real-time traffic data to dynamically reroute CAVs in anticipation of congestion. By continuously monitoring traffic conditions on dedicated lanes and tracking the real-time positions of buses, we enable the system to proactively adjust CAV routes when potential interference with bus operations is detected. This coordination mitigates delays affecting transit services and reduces travel time for CAVs. We evaluate the proposed strategy through simulation studies conducted in the SUMO. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both transit reliability and CAV operational performance across a range of traffic conditions.

Title: Physics-informed Learning for Passivity-based Tracking Control
Authors: Thomas Beckers, Leonardo Colombo
Abstract: Passivity-based control ensures system stability by leveraging dissipative properties and is widely applied in electrical and mechanical systems. Port-Hamiltonian systems (PHS), in particular, are well-suited for interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) due to their structured, energy-centric modeling approach. However, current IDA-PBC faces two key challenges: (i) it requires precise system knowledge, which is often unavailable due to model uncertainties, and (ii) it is typically limited to set-point control. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven tracking control approach based on a physics-informed model, namely Gaussian process Port-Hamiltonian systems, along with the modified matching equation. By leveraging the Bayesian nature of the model, we establish probabilistic stability and passivity guarantees. A simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Memory-less and Backscatter-less Tunnel Diode Harmonic Signatures for RFID
Authors: Christopher Saetia, Kaitlyn Graves, Serhat Tadik, Gregory D. Durgin
Abstract: Tunnel diodes have traditionally been researched for extending backscatter read-ranges for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags as reflection amplifiers. This paper explores the natural harmonics that arise from biasing these diodes within their negative differential resistance regions and with no interrogating signal from a transmitting source, such as an RFID reader, to injection-lock these diodes. These harmonics are characterized for five tunnel diode boards, made with the same components and with each board's fundamental frequencies measuring at above -15 dBm at a biasing voltage of 200 mV when measured over-the-cable. The occurrence of these harmonics creates unique harmonic signatures for each board and demonstrates possible harmonic RFID applications that can help RFID readers discover and even identify RFID tags with backscatter-less and memory-less IDs generated by tunnel diodes.

Title: Embracing Diffraction: A Paradigm Shift in Wireless Sensing and Communication
Authors: Anurag Pallaprolu, Winston Hurst, Yasamin Mostofi
Abstract: Wireless signals are integral to modern society, enabling both communication and increasingly, environmental sensing. While various propagation models exist, ranging from empirical methods to full-wave simulations, the phenomenon of electromagnetic diffraction is often treated as a secondary effect or a correction factor. This paper positions diffraction as a fundamentally important and underutilized mechanism that is rich with information about the physical environment. Specifically, diffraction-inducing elements generate distinct signatures that are rich with information about their underlying properties such as their geometries. We then argue that by understanding and exploiting these relationships, diffraction can be harnessed strategically. We introduce a general optimization framework to formalize this concept, illustrating how diffraction can be leveraged for both inverse problems (sensing scene details such as object geometries from measured fields) and forward problems (shaping RF fields for communication objectives by configuring diffracting elements). Focusing primarily on edge diffraction and Keller's Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), we discuss specific applications in RF sensing for scene understanding and in communications for RF field programming, drawing upon recent work. Overall, this paper lays out a vision for systematically incorporating diffraction into the design and operation of future wireless systems, paving the way for enhanced sensing capabilities and more robust communication strategies.

Title: Transfer Learning-Based Deep Residual Learning for Speech Recognition in Clean and Noisy Environments
Authors: Noussaiba Djeffal, Djamel Addou, Hamza Kheddar, Sid Ahmed Selouani
Abstract: Addressing the detrimental impact of non-stationary environmental noise on automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a persistent and significant research focus. Despite advancements, this challenge continues to be a major concern. Recently, data-driven supervised approaches, such as deep neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional unsupervised methods. With extensive training, these approaches have the potential to overcome the challenges posed by diverse real-life acoustic environments. In this light, this paper introduces a novel neural framework that incorporates a robust frontend into ASR systems in both clean and noisy environments. Utilizing the Aurora-2 speech database, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of an acoustic feature set for Mel-frequency, employing the approach of transfer learning based on Residual neural network (ResNet). The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. They achieved accuracies of 98.94% in clean and 91.21% in noisy mode.

Title: Seeing Heat with Color -- RGB-Only Wildfire Temperature Inference from SAM-Guided Multimodal Distillation using Radiometric Ground Truth
Authors: Michael Marinaccio, Fatemeh Afghah
Abstract: High-fidelity wildfire monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically requires multimodal sensing - especially RGB and thermal imagery - which increases hardware cost and power consumption. This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data, demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

Title: A Dual-Task Synergy-Driven Generalization Framework for Pancreatic Cancer Segmentation in CT Scans
Authors: Jun Li, Yijue Zhang, Haibo Shi, Minhong Li, Qiwei Li, Xiaohua Qian
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer, characterized by its notable prevalence and mortality rates, demands accurate lesion delineation for effective diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. The generalizability of extant methods is frequently compromised due to the pronounced variability in imaging and the heterogeneous characteristics of pancreatic lesions, which may mimic normal tissues and exhibit significant inter-patient variability. Thus, we propose a generalization framework that synergizes pixel-level classification and regression tasks, to accurately delineate lesions and improve model stability. This framework not only seeks to align segmentation contours with actual lesions but also uses regression to elucidate spatial relationships between diseased and normal tissues, thereby improving tumor localization and morphological characterization. Enhanced by the reciprocal transformation of task outputs, our approach integrates additional regression supervision within the segmentation context, bolstering the model's generalization ability from a dual-task perspective. Besides, dual self-supervised learning in feature spaces and output spaces augments the model's representational capability and stability across different imaging views. Experiments on 594 samples composed of three datasets with significant imaging differences demonstrate that our generalized pancreas segmentation results comparable to mainstream in-domain validation performance (Dice: 84.07%). More importantly, it successfully improves the results of the highly challenging cross-lesion generalized pancreatic cancer segmentation task by 9.51%. Thus, our model constitutes a resilient and efficient foundational technological support for pancreatic disease management and wider medical applications. The codes will be released at this https URL.

Title: Understanding the Mechanisms Behind Structural Influences on Link Prediction: A Case Study on FB15k-237
Authors: Xiaobo Jiang, Yadong Deng
Abstract: FB15k-237 mitigates the data leakage issue by excluding inverse and symmetric relationship triples, however, this has led to substantial performance degradation and slow improvement progress. Traditional approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness on FB15k-237, primarily because the underlying mechanism by which structural features of the dataset influence model performance remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we systematically investigate the impact mechanism of dataset structural features on link prediction performance. Firstly, we design a structured subgraph sampling strategy that ensures connectivity while constructing subgraphs with distinct structural features. Then, through correlation and sensitivity analyses conducted across several mainstream models, we observe that the distribution of relationship categories within subgraphs significantly affects performance, followed by the size of strongly connected components. Further exploration using the LIME model clarifies the intrinsic mechanism by which relationship categories influence link prediction performance, revealing that relationship categories primarily modulate the relative importance between entity embeddings and relationship embeddings and relationship embeddings, thereby affecting link prediction outcomes. These findings provide theoretical insights for addressing performance bottlenecks on FB15k-237, while the proposed analytical framework also offers methodological guidance for future studies dealing with structurally constrained datasets.

Title: Data-Driven Structural State Estimation via Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process Models
Authors: Yiming Fan, Fotis Kopsaftopoulos
Abstract: Guided wave-based techniques have been used extensively in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Models using guided waves can provide information from both time and frequency domains to make themselves accurate and robust. Probabilistic SHM models, which have the ability to account for uncertainties, are developed when decision confidence intervals are of interest. Most active-sensing guided-wave methods rely on the assumption that a large dataset can be collected, making them impractical when data collection is constrained by time or environmental factors. Meanwhile, although simulation results may lack the accuracy of real-world data, they are easier to obtain. In this context, models that integrate data from multiple sources have the potential to combine the accuracy of experimental data with the convenience of simulated data, without requiring large and potentially costly experimental datasets. The goal of this work is to introduce and assess a probabilistic multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression framework for damage state estimation via the use of both experimental and simulated guided waves. The main differences from previous works include the integration of damage-sensitive features (damage indices, DIs) extracted from both experimental and numerical sources, as well as the use of a relatively small amount of real-world data. The proposed model was validated by two test cases where multiple data sources exist. For each test case, experimental data were collected from a piezoelectric sensor network attached to an aluminum plate with various structural conditions, while simulated data were generated using either multiphysics finite element model (FEM) or physics-based signal reconstruction approaches under the same conditions.

Title: Efficient Multi Subject Visual Reconstruction from fMRI Using Aligned Representations
Authors: Christos Zangos, Danish Ebadulla, Thomas Christopher Sprague, Ambuj Singh
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject and dataset-agnostic.

Title: A Practitioner's Guide to Automatic Kernel Search for Gaussian Processes in Battery Applications
Authors: Huang Zhang, Xixi Liu, Faisal Altaf, Torsten Wik
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models have been used in a wide range of battery applications, in which different kernels were manually selected with considerable expertise. However, to capture complex relationships in the ever-growing amount of real-world data, selecting a suitable kernel for the GP model in battery applications is increasingly challenging. In this work, we first review existing GP kernels used in battery applications and then extend an automatic kernel search method with a new base kernel and model selection criteria. The GP models with composite kernels outperform the baseline kernel in two numerical examples of battery applications, i.e., battery capacity estimation and residual load prediction. Particularly, the results indicate that the Bayesian Information Criterion may be the best model selection criterion as it achieves a good trade-off between kernel performance and computational complexity. This work should, therefore, be of value to practitioners wishing to automate their kernel search process in battery applications.

Title: Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System
Authors: Shaohong Pei, Da-Qing Zhang, Feilong Lu
Abstract: GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.

Title: A brain-inspired generative model for EEG-based cognitive state identification
Authors: Bin Hu, Zhi-Hong Guan
Abstract: This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot this http URL studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.

Title: Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation Using LinDistFlow Model with Loss Compensation
Authors: Yanlin Jiang, Xinliang Dai, Frederik Zahn, Veit Hagenmeyer
Abstract: With the increasing integration of renewable energy resources and the growing need for data privacy between system operators, flexibility aggregation methods have emerged as a promising solution to coordinate integrated transmissiondistribution (ITD) systems with limited information exchange. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to the nonlinearity of AC power flow models, and therefore mostly rely on linearized models. This paper examines the inherent errors in the LinDistFlow model, a linearized approximation, and demonstrates their impact on flexibility aggregation. To address these issues, we propose an intuitive compensation approach to refine the LinDistFlow-based flexibility set. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in efficiently coordinating ITD systems.

Title: Real-Time, Single-Ear, Wearable ECG Reconstruction, R-Peak Detection, and HR/HRV Monitoring
Authors: Carlos Santos, Sebastian Frey, Andrea Cossettini, Luca Benini, Victor Kartsch
Abstract: Biosignal monitoring, in particular heart activity through heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) tracking, is vital in enabling continuous, non-invasive tracking of physiological and cognitive states. Recent studies have explored compact, head-worn devices for HR and HRV monitoring to improve usability and reduce stigma. However, this approach is challenged by the current reliance on wet electrodes, which limits usability, the weakness of ear-derived signals, making HR/HRV extraction more complex, and the incompatibility of current algorithms for embedded deployment. This work introduces a single-ear wearable system for real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram) parameter estimation, which directly runs on BioGAP, an energy-efficient device for biosignal acquisition and processing. By combining SoA in-ear electrode technology, an optimized DeepMF algorithm, and BioGAP, our proposed subject-independent approach allows for robust extraction of HR/HRV parameters directly on the device with just 36.7 uJ/inference at comparable performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art architecture, achieving 0.49 bpm and 25.82 ms for HR/HRV mean errors, respectively and an estimated battery life of 36h with a total system power consumption of 7.6 mW. Clinical relevance: The ability to reconstruct ECG signals and extract HR and HRV paves the way for continuous, unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring with head-worn devices. In particular, the integration of cardiovascular measurements in everyday-use devices (such as earbuds) has potential in continuous at-home monitoring to enable early detection of cardiovascular irregularities.

Title: Optimized Cascaded Position Control of BLDC Motors Considering Torque Ripple
Authors: Mohammad Vedadi
Abstract: Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are increasingly used in various industries due to their reliability, low noise, and extended lifespan compared to traditional DC motors. Their high torque-to-weight ratio and impressive starting torque make them ideal for automotive, robotics, and industrial applications. This paper explores the multi-objective tuning of BLDC motor controllers, focusing on position and torque ripple. A state-space model of the BLDC motor and the entire control system, including the power stage and control structure, is developed in the Simulink environment. Two common control mechanisms, trapezoidal and Field Oriented Control (FOC), are implemented and optimized. Both mechanisms utilize a cascaded closed-loop position control, providing fair disturbance rejection but requiring challenging tuning of the controllers. To address these challenges, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used for optimization. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of optimization techniques in enhancing the performance of control systems.

Title: CLOG-CD: Curriculum Learning based on Oscillating Granularity of Class Decomposed Medical Image Classification
Authors: Asmaa Abbas, Mohamed Gaber, Mohammed M. Abdelsamea
Abstract: Curriculum learning strategies have been proven to be effective in various applications and have gained significant interest in the field of machine learning. It has the ability to improve the final model's performance and accelerate the training process. However, in the medical imaging domain, data irregularities can make the recognition task more challenging and usually result in misclassification between the different classes in the dataset. Class-decomposition approaches have shown promising results in solving such a problem by learning the boundaries within the classes of the data set. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) training method based on the curriculum learning strategy and the class decomposition approach, which we call CLOG-CD, to improve the performance of medical image classification. We evaluated our method on four different imbalanced medical image datasets, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and histopathology colorectal cancer (CRC). CLOG-CD utilises the learnt weights from the decomposition granularity of the classes, and the training is accomplished from descending to ascending order (i.e., anti-curriculum technique). We also investigated the classification performance of our proposed method based on different acceleration factors and pace function curricula. We used two pre-trained networks, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, as the backbone for CLOG-CD. The results with ResNet-50 show that CLOG-CD has the ability to improve classification performance with an accuracy of 96.08% for the CXR dataset, 96.91% for the brain tumour dataset, 79.76% for the digital knee X-ray, and 99.17% for the CRC dataset, compared to other training strategies. In addition, with DenseNet-121, CLOG-CD has achieved 94.86%, 94.63%, 76.19%, and 99.45% for CXR, brain tumour, digital knee X-ray, and CRC datasets, respectively

Title: Easz: An Agile Transformer-based Image Compression Framework for Resource-constrained IoTs
Authors: Yu Mao, Jingzong Li, Jun Wang, Hong Xu, Tei-Wei Kuo, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue
Abstract: Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently, it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a new transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz. Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a real-world testbed demonstrate multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and image reconstruction quality.

Title: Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification with Device Information in the DCASE 2025 Challenge
Authors: Florian Schmid, Paul Primus, Toni Heittola, Annamaria Mesaros, Irene Martín-Morató, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: This paper presents the Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification with Device Information Task of the DCASE 2025 Challenge and its baseline system. Continuing the focus on low-complexity models, data efficiency, and device mismatch from previous editions (2022--2024), this year's task introduces a key change: recording device information is now provided at inference time. This enables the development of device-specific models that leverage device characteristics -- reflecting real-world deployment scenarios in which a model is designed with awareness of the underlying hardware. The training set matches the 25% subset used in the corresponding DCASE 2024 challenge, with no restrictions on external data use, highlighting transfer learning as a central topic. The baseline achieves 50.72% accuracy on this ten-class problem with a device-general model, improving to 51.89% when using the available device information.

Title: LensNet: An End-to-End Learning Framework for Empirical Point Spread Function Modeling and Lensless Imaging Reconstruction
Authors: Jiesong Bai, Yuhao Yin, Yihang Dong, Xiaofeng Zhang, Chi-Man Pun, Xuhang Chen
Abstract: Lensless imaging stands out as a promising alternative to conventional lens-based systems, particularly in scenarios demanding ultracompact form factors and cost-effective architectures. However, such systems are fundamentally governed by the Point Spread Function (PSF), which dictates how a point source contributes to the final captured signal. Traditional lensless techniques often require explicit calibrations and extensive pre-processing, relying on static or approximate PSF models. These rigid strategies can result in limited adaptability to real-world challenges, including noise, system imperfections, and dynamic scene variations, thus impeding high-fidelity reconstruction. In this paper, we propose LensNet, an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates spatial-domain and frequency-domain representations in a unified pipeline. Central to our approach is a learnable Coded Mask Simulator (CMS) that enables dynamic, data-driven estimation of the PSF during training, effectively mitigating the shortcomings of fixed or sparsely calibrated kernels. By embedding a Wiener filtering component, LensNet refines global structure and restores fine-scale details, thus alleviating the dependency on multiple handcrafted pre-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate LensNet's robust performance and superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving high-frequency details and attenuating noise. The proposed framework establishes a novel convergence between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, paving the way for more accurate, flexible, and practical lensless imaging solutions for applications ranging from miniature sensors to medical diagnostics.

Title: On the Design of Resilient Distributed Single Time-Scale Estimators: A Graph-Theoretic Approach
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Mohammad Pirani
Abstract: Distributed estimation in interconnected systems has gained increasing attention due to its relevance in diverse applications such as sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop. On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of $q$-node-connectivity and $q$-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to $q$ sensors or $q$ communication links.

Title: Multiple Receiver Over-the-Air Computation for Wireless Networked Control Systems
Authors: Seif Hussein, Chinwendu Enyioha, Carlo Fischione
Abstract: We propose a multi-sender, multi-receiver over-the-air computation (OAC) framework for wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with structural constraints. Our approach enables actuators to directly compute and apply control signals from sensor measurements, eliminating the need for a centralized controller. We use an iterative and convexifying procedure to obtain a control law that is structured with respect to the network topology and minimizes the overall system energy-to-energy gain. Furthermore, we solve a constrained matrix factorization problem to find the optimal OAC configuration with respect to power consumption, robustness, and stability of the WNCS. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithms and present numerical results that validate our approach to preserve closed-loop stability with robust control performance and constrained power.

Title: Evaluating an assembly- and disassembly-oriented expansion of Modular Function Deployment through a workshop-based assessment
Authors: Fabio Marco Monetti
Abstract: Modular product architectures are used to enhance flexibility, reduce production complexity, and support sustainability goals. However, traditional Modular Function Deployment (MFD) method does not fully integrate Design for Assembly (DFA) and Design for Disassembly (DFD) principles, leading to sub-optimal manufacturability and end-of-life strategies. This study introduces an expanded MFD method incorporating assembly and disassembly considerations into early-stage modularisation. A workshop-based evaluation assesses usability and applicability, involving participants using standard and expanded MFD. Results indicate that integrating DFA and DFD enhances assembly efficiency, ease of disassembly, and modular product strategy alignment. However, usability challenges were identified, necessitating refinements for industry application.

Title: Continuous Filtered Backprojection by Learnable Interpolation Network
Authors: Hui Lin, Dong Zeng, Qi Xie, Zerui Mao, Jianhua Ma, Deyu Meng
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images is crucial in medical imaging field. However, there are unavoidable interpolation errors in the backprojection step of the conventional reconstruction methods, i.e., filtered-back-projection based methods, which are detrimental to the accurate reconstruction. In this study, to address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning model, named Leanable-Interpolation-based FBP or LInFBP shortly, to enhance the reconstructed CT image quality, which achieves learnable interpolation in the backprojection step of filtered backprojection (FBP) and alleviates the interpolation errors. Specifically, in the proposed LInFBP, we formulate every local piece of the latent continuous function of discrete sinogram data as a linear combination of selected basis functions, and learn this continuous function by exploiting a deep network to predict the linear combination coefficients. Then, the learned latent continuous function is exploited for interpolation in backprojection step, which first time takes the advantage of deep learning for the interpolation in FBP. Extensive experiments, which encompass diverse CT scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LInFBP in terms of enhanced reconstructed image quality, plug-and-play ability and generalization capability.

Title: Pinching Antenna-enabled ISAC Systems: Exploiting Look-Angle Dependence of RCS for Target Diversity
Authors: Ata Khalili, Brikena Kaziu, Vasilis K. Papanikolaou, Robert Schober
Abstract: We investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system supported by pinching antennas (PAs), which can be dynamically activated along a dielectric waveguide to collect spatially diverse observations. This capability allows different PAs to view the same target from different angles across time, thereby introducing target diversity, which is a key advantage over conventional fixed antenna arrays. To quantify the sensing reliability, we adopt the outage probability as a performance metric, capturing the likelihood that the accumulated radar echo signal power falls below a detection threshold. In contrast to traditional ISAC models that assume deterministic sensing channels, we explicitly account for the look-angle dependence of radar cross-section (RCS) by modeling it as a random variable. We ensure the long-term quality-of-service (QoS) for communication users by enforcing an accumulated data rate constraint over time. We derive an exact closed-form expression for the sensing outage probability based on the distribution of weighted sums of exponentially distributed random variables. Since the resulting expression is highly non-convex and intractable for optimization, we use a tractable upper bound based on the Chernoff inequality and formulate a PA activation optimization problem. A successive convex approximation (SCA) framework is proposed to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Numerical results show that dynamically activating different PAs across time slots significantly enhances sensing reliability compared to repeatedly activating the same PA at a fixed position and conventional antenna selection schemes, respectively. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating outage-based reliability metrics and target diversity into ISAC systems using PAs.

Title: Spreading the Wave: Low-Complexity PAPR Reduction for AFDM and OCDM in 6G Networks
Authors: Afan Ali, Abdelali Arous, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is still a common issue in multicarrier signal modulation systems such as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) and Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), which are envisioned to play a central role in 6G networks. To this end, this paper aims to investigate a novel and low-complexity solution towards minimizing the PAPR with the aid of a unified premodulation data spreading paradigm. It analyze four spreading techniques namely, Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT), Discrete Cosine transform (DCT), Zadoff-Chu transform (ZC), and Interleaved Discrete Fourier transform (IDFT), which assist in preallocating energy prior to OCDM and AFDM modulation. The proposed method takes advantage of the inherent characteristics of chirp-based modulation to achieve a notable reduction in PAPR at minimal computational load and no side information as compared to past solutions, such as Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) or Selected Mapping (SLM), which suffers with a high computational complexity. The proposed method has an additional benefit of achieving an improvement in phase selectivity by increasing chirp parameters of AFDM and quadratic phase of OCDM, which amplifies the robustness in doubly dispersive channels. It further reduces interference by smoothing the output spread signal. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate an improvement in the overall energy efficiency and scalability of large ioT sensor networks.

Title: Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed ISAC Systems: An Autoencoder Approach
Authors: Guangjin Pan, Zhixing Li, Ayça Özçelikkale, Christian Häger, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.

Title: Adaptive DRL for IRS Mirror Orientation in Dynamic OWC Networks
Authors: Ahrar N. Hamad, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir E.H. El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate line-of-sight (LoS) blockages and enhance signal coverage in optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. In this work, we consider a mirror-based IRS to assist a dynamic indoor visible light communication (VLC) environment. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate by adjusting the orientation of the IRS mirrors. To enable real-time adaptability, the problem is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, specifically deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is employed to optimize mirror orientation toward mobile users under blockage and mobility constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDPG-based approach outperforms conventional DRL algorithms and achieves substantial improvements in sum rate compared to fixed-orientation IRS configurations.

Title: Near-field 5D Pose Estimation using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Srikar Sharma Sadhu, Praful D. Mankar, Santosh Nannuru
Abstract: The advent of 6G is expected to enable many use cases which may rely on accurate knowledge of the location and orientation of user equipment (UE). The conventional localization methods suffer from limitations such as synchronization and high power consumption required for multiple active anchors. This can be mitigated by utilizing a large dimensional passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). This paper presents a novel low-complexity approach for the estimation of 5D pose (i.e. 3D location and 2D orientation) of a UE in near-field RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach exploits the symmetric arrangement of uniform planar array of RIS and uniform linear array of UE to decouple the 5D problem into five 1D sub-problems. Further, we solve these sub-problems using a total least squares ESPRIT inspired approach to obtain closed-form solutions.

Title: Multi-Scale Target-Aware Representation Learning for Fundus Image Enhancement
Authors: Haofan Wu, Yin Huang, Yuqing Wu, Qiuyu Yang, Bingfang Wang, Li Zhang, Muhammad Fahadullah Khan, Ali Zia, M.Saleh Memon, Syed Sohail Bukhari, Abdul Fattah Memon, Daizong Ji, Ya Zhang, Ghulam Mustafa, Yin Fang
Abstract: High-quality fundus images provide essential anatomical information for clinical screening and ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Yet, due to hardware limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE) that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA) module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts. Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.

Title: Impact of Chirality on the Properties of Two-Dimensional Images Propagating Through a Chiral Dispersive Thick Lens
Authors: Salaheddeen Bugoffa, Hussin Ragb
Abstract: Dual image formation for a two-dimensional object via bimodal propagation through chiral-dispersive thick lens is derived. In this article, first-order frequency-dependent material dispersion of the dielectric permittivity and the lens material being chiral are considered. In addition, the thick lens is configured in a uniform background. A salient feature of a chiral thick lens is the inherent bimodal propagation via circular polarizations. Under chirality, two sets of ABCD frequency dependent matrices are derived for right- and left-circularly polarized modes based on standard paraxial and meridional conditions. For imaging purposes, a simple2D colored transparency is placed as an object before the thick lens. The image transmission across the lens examined via the ABCD matrix parameters and defocusing effects due to dispersion under different chirality bands.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Frequency Control of LCC-S Resonant Converters for Wireless Power Transfer Systems
Authors: Reza Safari, Mohsen Hamzeh, Nima Mahdian Dehkordi
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control strategy for achieving precise and robust output voltage regulation in LCC-S resonant converters, specifically designed for wireless power transfer applications. Unlike conventional methods that rely on manually tuned PI controllers or heuristic tuning approaches, our method leverages the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to systematically optimize PI controller parameters. The complex converter dynamics are captured using the Direct Piecewise Affine (DPWA) modeling technique, providing a structured approach to handling its nonlinearities. This integration not only eliminates the need for manual tuning, but also enhances control adaptability under varying operating conditions. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed DRL-based tuning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability, robustness, and response time. This work demonstrates the potential of DRL in power electronic control, offering a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional controller design approaches.

Abstract: Very High Throughput satellites typically provide multibeam coverage, however, a common problem is that there can be a mismatch between the capacity of each beam and the traffic demand: some beams may fall short, while others exceed the requirements. This challenge can be addressed by integrating machine learning with flexible payload and adaptive beamforming techniques. These methods allow for dynamic allocation of payload resources based on real-time capacity needs. As artificial intelligence advances, its ability to automate tasks, enhance efficiency, and increase precision is proving invaluable, especially in satellite communications, where traditional optimization methods are often computationally intensive. AI-driven solutions offer faster, more effective ways to handle complex satellite communication tasks. Artificial intelligence in space has more constraints than other fields, considering the radiation effects, the spaceship power capabilities, mass, and area. Current onboard processing uses legacy space-certified general-purpose processors, costly application-specific integrated circuits, or field-programmable gate arrays subjected to a highly stringent certification process. The increased performance demands of onboard processors to satisfy the accelerated data rates and autonomy requirements have rendered current space-graded processors obsolete. This work is focused on transforming the satellite payload using artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies over available commercial off-the-shelf chips for onboard processing. The objectives include validating artificial intelligence-driven scenarios, focusing on flexible payload and adaptive beamforming as machine learning models onboard. Results show that machine learning models significantly improve signal quality, spectral efficiency, and throughput compared to conventional payload.

Title: Accelerating Volumetric Medical Image Annotation via Short-Long Memory SAM 2
Authors: Yuwen Chen, Zafer Yildiz, Qihang Li, Yaqian Chen, Haoyu Dong, Hanxue Gu, Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.

Title: Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models for Inland Water Body Segmentation from SAR Images
Authors: Siddharth Kothari, Srinivasan Murali, Sankalp Kothari, Ujjwal Verma, Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair
Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link - this https URL)

Title: Securing 5G and Beyond-Enabled UAV Networks: Resilience Through Multiagent Learning and Transformers Detection
Authors: Joseanne Viana, Hamed Farkhari, Victor P Gil Jimenez
Abstract: Achieving resilience remains a significant challenge for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communications in 5G and 6G networks. Although UAVs benefit from superior positioning capabilities, rate optimization techniques, and extensive line-of-sight (LoS) range, these advantages alone cannot guarantee high reliability across diverse UAV use cases. This limitation becomes particularly evident in urban environments, where UAVs face vulnerability to jamming attacks and where LoS connectivity is frequently compromised by buildings and other physical obstructions. This paper introduces DET-FAIR- WINGS ( Detection-Enhanced Transformer Framework for AI-Resilient Wireless Networks in Ground UAV Systems), a novel solution designed to enhance reliability in UAV communications under attacks. Our system leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and transformer-based detection algorithms to identify attack patterns within the network and subsequently select the most appropriate mechanisms to strengthen reliability in authenticated UAV-Base Station links. The DET-FAIR-WINGS approach integrates both discrete and continuous parameters. Discrete parameters include retransmission attempts, bandwidth partitioning, and notching mechanisms, while continuous parameters encompass beam angles and elevations from both the Base Station (BS) and user devices. The detection part integrates a transformer in the agents to speed up training. Our findings demonstrate that replacing fixed retransmission counts with AI-integrated flexible approaches in 5G networks significantly reduces latency by optimizing decision-making processes within 5G layers.

Title: Predictive and Proactive Power Allocation For Energy Efficiency in Dynamic OWC Networks
Authors: Walter Zibusiso Ncube, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani
Abstract: Driven by the exponential growth in data traffic and the limitations of Radio Frequency (RF) networks, Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for high data rate communication. However, the inherently dynamic nature of OWC environments resulting from user mobility, and time-varying user demands poses significant challenges for enhanced and sustainable performance. Energy efficiency (EE) is a critical metric for the sustainable operation of next generation wireless networks. Achieving high EE in dynamic OWC environments, especially under time-varying user distributions and heterogeneous service requirements, remains a complex task. In this work, we formulate a discrete-time EE optimisation problem in a dynamic OWC to maximise energy efficiency through determining user connectivity and power allocation. Solving this problem in real time is computationally demanding due to the coupling of user association and power allocation variables over discrete time slots. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Prediction and Optimised Power Allocation (PDP-OPA) framework which predicts user arrivals, departures, and traffic demands. Based on these predictions, the framework proactively determines AP-user associations and allocates power dynamically using a Lagrangian-based optimisation strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDP-OPA significantly enhances system performance, providing solutions close to the optimal ones. The proposed framework improves energy efficiency, sum rate, and bit error rate (BER) compared to distance-based user association and uniform power allocation, validating its effectiveness for real time and adaptive resource management in dynamic OWC systems.

Title: UNet-3D with Adaptive TverskyCE Loss for Pancreas Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Xubei Zhang, Mikhail Y. Shalaginov, Tingying Helen Zeng
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer, which has a low survival rate, is the most intractable one among all cancers. Most diagnoses of this cancer heavily depend on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. Therefore, pancreas segmentation is crucial but challenging. Because of the obscure position of the pancreas, surrounded by other large organs, and its small area, the pancreas has often been impeded and difficult to detect. With these challenges , the segmentation results based on Deep Learning (DL) models still need to be improved. In this research, we propose a novel adaptive TverskyCE loss for DL model training, which combines Tversky loss with cross-entropy loss using learnable weights. Our method enables the model to adjust the loss contribution automatically and find the best objective function during training. All experiments were conducted on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pancreas-CT dataset. We evaluated the adaptive TverskyCE loss on the UNet-3D and Dilated UNet-3D, and our method achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.59%, with peak performance up to 95.24%, and the score of 85.14%. DSC and the score were improved by 9.47% and 8.98% respectively compared with the baseline UNet-3D with Tversky loss for pancreas segmentation.

Title: Hybrid Image Resolution Quality Metric (HIRQM):A Comprehensive Perceptual Image Quality Assessment Framework
Authors: Vineesh Kumar Reddy Mondem
Abstract: Traditional image quality assessment metrics like Mean Squared Error and Structural Similarity Index often fail to reflect perceptual quality under complex distortions. We propose the Hybrid Image Resolution Quality Metric (HIRQM), integrating statistical, multi-scale, and deep learning-based methods for a comprehensive quality evaluation. HIRQM combines three components: Probability Density Function for local pixel distribution analysis, Multi-scale Feature Similarity for structural integrity across resolutions, and Hierarchical Deep Image Features using a pre-trained VGG16 network for semantic alignment with human perception. A dynamic weighting mechanism adapts component contributions based on image characteristics like brightness and variance, enhancing flexibility across distortion types. Our contributions include a unified metric and dynamic weighting for better perceptual alignment. Evaluated on TID2013 and LIVE datasets, HIRQM achieves Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.92 and 0.90, outperforming traditional metrics. It excels in handling noise, blur, and compression artifacts, making it valuable for image processing applications like compression and restoration.

Title: EMulator: Rapid Estimation of Complex-valued Electric Fields using a U-Net Architecture
Authors: Fatima Ahsan, Lorenzo Luzi, Richard G. Barainuk, Sameer A. Sheth, Wayne Goodman, Behnaam Aazhang
Abstract: A common factor across electromagnetic methodologies of brain stimulation is the optimization of essential dosimetry parameters, like amplitude, phase, and location of one or more transducers, which controls the stimulation strength and targeting precision. Since obtaining in-vivo measurements for the electric field distribution inside the biological tissue is challenging, physics-based simulators are used. However, these simulators are computationally expensive and time-consuming, making repeated calculations of electric fields for optimization purposes computationally prohibitive. To overcome this issue, we developed EMulator, a U-Net architecture-based regression model, for fast and robust complex electric field estimation. We trained EMulator using electric fields generated by 43 antennas placed around 14 segmented human brain models. Once trained, EMulator uses a segmented human brain model with an antenna location as an input and outputs the corresponding electric field. A representative result of our study is that, at 1.5 GHz, on the validation dataset consisting of 6 subjects, we can estimate the electric field with the magnitude of complex correlation coefficient of 0.978. Additionally, we could calculate the electric field with a mean time of 4.4 ms. On average, this is at least x1200 faster than the time required by state-of-the-art physics-based simulator COMSOL. The significance of this work is that it shows the possibility of real-time calculation of the electric field from the segmented human head model and antenna location, making it possible to optimize the amplitude, phase, and location of several different transducers with stochastic gradient descent since our model is almost everywhere differentiable.

Title: Spreading over OFDM for Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) Ranging: Multi-user Interference Mitigation
Authors: Karim A. Said, Ibraheem Alturki, Husheng Li, Elizabeth Bentley, Lingjia Liu
Abstract: In the context of communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform was proven to be optimal in minimizing ranging sidelobes when random signaling is used. A typical assumption in OFDM-based ranging is that the max target delay is less than the cyclic prefix (CP) length, which is equivalent to performing a \textit{periodic} correlation between the signal reflected from the target and the transmitted signal. In the multi-user case, such as in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), users are assigned disjoint subsets of subcarriers which eliminates mutual interference between the communication channels of the different users. However, ranging involves an aperiodic correlation operation for target ranges with delays greater than the CP length. Aperiodic correlation between signals from disjoint frequency bands will not be zero, resulting in mutual interference between different user bands. We refer to this as \textit{inter-band} (IB) cross-correlation interference. In this work, we analytically characterize IB interference and quantify its impact on the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). We introduce an orthogonal spreading layer on top of OFDM that can reduce IB interference resulting in ISL levels significantly lower than for OFDM without spreading in the multi-user setup. We validate our claims through simulations, and using an upper bound on IB energy which we show that it can be minimized using our proposed spreading. However, for orthogonal spreading to be effective, a price must be paid in terms of spectral utilization, which is yet another manifestation of the trade-off between sensing accuracy and data communication capacity

Title: CSASN: A Multitask Attention-Based Framework for Heterogeneous Thyroid Carcinoma Classification in Ultrasound Images
Authors: Peiqi Li, Yincheng Gao, Renxing Li, Haojie Yang, Yunyun Liu, Boji Liu, Jiahui Ni, Ying Zhang, Yulu Wu, Xiaowei Fang, Lehang Guo, Liping Sun, Jiangang Chen
Abstract: Heterogeneous morphological features and data imbalance pose significant challenges in rare thyroid carcinoma classification using ultrasound imaging. To address this issue, we propose a novel multitask learning framework, Channel-Spatial Attention Synergy Network (CSASN), which integrates a dual-branch feature extractor - combining EfficientNet for local spatial encoding and ViT for global semantic modeling, with a cascaded channel-spatial attention refinement module. A residual multiscale classifier and dynamically weighted loss function further enhance classification stability and accuracy. Trained on a multicenter dataset comprising more than 2000 patients from four clinical institutions, our framework leverages a residual multiscale classifier and dynamically weighted loss function to enhance classification stability and accuracy. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to model performance, particularly in recognizing rare subtypes such as FTC and MTC carcinomas. Experimental results show that CSASN outperforms existing single-stream CNN or Transformer-based models, achieving a superior balance between precision and recall under class-imbalanced conditions. This framework provides a promising strategy for AI-assisted thyroid cancer diagnosis.

Authors: Ruiqi Wang, Pinjun Zheng, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Atif Shamim
Abstract: In this work, a novel design of electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs) based on a fluid antenna system (FAS) is proposed, and the corresponding wireless channel model is established. Different from conventional antenna arrays with static elements, the electromagnetic characteristics of each array element in the proposed ERA can be flexibly reconfigured into various states, introducing electromagnetic degrees of freedom to enhance wireless system performance. Based on the proposed ERA design, the corresponding channel model is developed. Finally, full-wave simulations are conducted to validate the overall design concept. The results reveal that a gain enhancement of 2.5 dB is achieved at a beamforming direction.

Title: Tri-Hybrid Multi-User Precoding Based on Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Yuchen Zhang, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Md. Jahangir Hossain, Anas Chaaban
Abstract: The tri-hybrid precoding architecture based on electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs) is a promising solution for overcoming key limitations in multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. Aiming to further understand its potential, this paper investigates the tri-hybrid multi-user precoding problem using pattern reconfigurable ERAs. To reduce model complexity and improve practicality, we characterize each antenna's radiation pattern using a spherical harmonics decomposition. While mathematically tractable, this approach may lead to over-optimized patterns that are physically unrealizable. To address this, we introduce a projection step that maps the optimized patterns onto a realizable set. Simulation results demonstrate that spherical harmonics-based radiation pattern optimization significantly enhances sum rate performance. However, after projection onto a realizable set obtained from real ERA hardware, the performance gain is notably reduced or even negligible, underscoring the need for more effective projection techniques and improved reconfigurable antenna hardware.

Title: OASIS: Optimized Lightweight Autoencoder System for Distributed In-Sensor computing
Authors: Chengwei Zhou, Sreetama Sarkar, Yuming Li, Arnab Sanyal, Gourav Datta
Abstract: In-sensor computing, which integrates computation directly within the sensor, has emerged as a promising paradigm for machine vision applications such as AR/VR and smart home systems. By processing data on-chip before transmission, it alleviates the bandwidth bottleneck caused by high-resolution, high-frame-rate image transmission, particularly in video applications. We envision a system architecture that integrates a CMOS image sensor (CIS) with a logic chip via advanced packaging, where the logic chip processes early-stage deep neural network (DNN) layers. However, its limited compute and memory make deploying advanced DNNs challenging. A simple solution is to split the model, executing the first part on the logic chip and the rest off-chip. However, modern DNNs require multiple layers before dimensionality reduction, limiting their ability to achieve the primary goal of in-sensor computing: minimizing data bandwidth. To address this, we propose a dual-branch autoencoder-based vision architecture that deploys a lightweight encoder on the logic chip while the task-specific network runs off-chip. The encoder is trained using a triple loss function: (1) task-specific loss to optimize accuracy, (2) entropy loss to enforce compact and compressible representations, and (3) reconstruction loss (mean-square error) to preserve essential visual information. This design enables a four-order-of-magnitude reduction in output activation dimensionality compared to input images, resulting in a $2{-}4.5\times$ decrease in energy consumption, as validated by our hardware-backed semi-analytical energy models. We evaluate our approach on CNN and ViT-based models across applications in smart home and augmented reality domains, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with energy efficiency of up to 22.7 TOPS/W.

Title: Inverse Modeling of Dielectric Response in Time Domain using Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Emir Esenov, Olof Hjortstam, Yuriy Serdyuk, Thomas Hammarström, Christian Häger
Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results, equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits. To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size, training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific computation.

Title: Multimodal Deep Learning-Empowered Beam Prediction in Future THz ISAC Systems
Authors: Kai Zhang, Wentao Yu, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating at terahertz (THz) bands are envisioned to enable both ultra-high data-rate communication and precise environmental awareness for next-generation wireless networks. However, the narrow width of THz beams makes them prone to misalignment and necessitates frequent beam prediction in dynamic environments. Multimodal sensing, which integrates complementary modalities such as camera images, positional data, and radar measurements, has recently emerged as a promising solution for proactive beam prediction. Nevertheless, existing multimodal approaches typically employ static fusion architectures that cannot adjust to varying modality reliability and contributions, thereby degrading predictive performance and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient multimodal mixture-of-experts (MoE) deep learning framework for proactive beam prediction in THz ISAC systems. The proposed multimodal MoE framework employs multiple modality-specific expert networks to extract representative features from individual sensing modalities, and dynamically fuses them using adaptive weights generated by a gating network according to the instantaneous reliability of each modality. Simulation results in realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MoE framework outperforms traditional static fusion methods and unimodal baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability, highlighting its potential in practical THz ISAC systems with ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).

Title: An Arbitrary-Modal Fusion Network for Volumetric Cranial Nerves Tract Segmentation
Authors: Lei Xie, Huajun Zhou, Junxiong Huang, Jiahao Huang, Qingrun Zeng, Jianzhong He, Jiawei Zhang, Baohua Fan, Mingchu Li, Guoqiang Xie, Hao Chen, Yuanjing Feng
Abstract: The segmentation of cranial nerves (CNs) tract provides a valuable quantitative tool for the analysis of the morphology and trajectory of individual CNs. Multimodal CNs tract segmentation networks, e.g., CNTSeg, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI, have achieved promising segmentation performance. However, it is laborious or even infeasible to collect complete multimodal data in clinical practice due to limitations in equipment, user privacy, and working conditions. In this work, we propose a novel arbitrary-modal fusion network for volumetric CNs tract segmentation, called CNTSeg-v2, which trains one model to handle different combinations of available modalities. Instead of directly combining all the modalities, we select T1-weighted (T1w) images as the primary modality due to its simplicity in data acquisition and contribution most to the results, which supervises the information selection of other auxiliary modalities. Our model encompasses an Arbitrary-Modal Collaboration Module (ACM) designed to effectively extract informative features from other auxiliary modalities, guided by the supervision of T1w images. Meanwhile, we construct a Deep Distance-guided Multi-stage (DDM) decoder to correct small errors and discontinuities through signed distance maps to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate our CNTSeg-v2 on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset and the clinical Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset. Extensive experimental results show that our CNTSeg-v2 achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, outperforming all competing methods.

Title: Diagnostic Uncertainty in Pneumonia Detection using CNN MobileNetV2 and CNN from Scratch
Authors: Kennard Norbert Sudiardjo, Islam Nur Alam, Wilson Wijaya, Lili Ayu Wulandhari
Abstract: Pneumonia Diagnosis, though it is crucial for an effective treatment, it can be hampered by uncertainty. This uncertainty starts to arise due to some factors like atypical presentations, limitations of diagnostic tools such as chest X-rays, and the presence of co-existing respiratory conditions. This research proposes one of the supervised learning methods, CNN. Using MobileNetV2 as the pre-trained one with ResNet101V2 architecture and using Keras API as the built from scratch model, for identifying lung diseases especially pneumonia. The datasets used in this research were obtained from the website through Kaggle. The result shows that by implementing CNN MobileNetV2 and CNN from scratch the result is promising. While validating data, MobileNetV2 performs with stability and minimal overfitting, while the training accuracy increased to 84.87% later it slightly decreased to 78.95%, with increasing validation loss from 0.499 to 0.6345. Nonetheless, MobileNetV2 is more stable. Although it takes more time to train each epoch. Meanwhile, after the 10th epoch, the Scratch model displayed more instability and overfitting despite having higher validation accuracy, training accuracy decreased significantly to 78.12% and the validation loss increased from 0.5698 to 1.1809. With these results, ResNet101V2 offers stability, and the Scratch model offers high accuracy.

Title: Impact of Transceiver Selection on Synchronization Accuracy in White Rabbit Networks
Authors: Michal Špaček, Josef Vojtěch, Jaroslav Roztočil
Abstract: Achieving optimal synchronization accuracy between two White Rabbit devices hinges on the proper selection of transceivers, which act as electro-optical converters connecting WR devices to the optical network infrastructure. The correct choice of transceivers can significantly improve resilience to changes in the time offset between WR devices due to temperature fluctuations in the connecting optical fiber. To compare the performance of BiDi WDM and DWDM transceivers, an experimental setup was established under laboratory conditions to simulate a real optical network used for distributing precise time and frequency between two remote locations. The optical connection was emulated by integrating a 20 km G.652.D optical fiber into a climatic chamber, which provided variable environmental conditions similar to those experienced in real applications. The study compared BiDi WDM 1310/1550 nm transceivers with DWDM Ch33/Ch34 transceivers. Results showed that DWDM transceivers exhibited nearly thirteen times less sensitivity to temperature-induced changes in the optical connection, leading to a smaller time offset. Therefore, for achieving the highest accuracy in synchronizing WR devices in practical applications, DWDM transceiver technology is essential.

Title: Deep learning of personalized priors from past MRI scans enables fast, quality-enhanced point-of-care MRI with low-cost systems
Authors: Tal Oved, Beatrice Lena, Chloé F. Najac, Sheng Shen, Matthew S. Rosen, Andrew Webb, Efrat Shimron
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superb-quality images, but its accessibility is limited by high costs, posing challenges for patients requiring longitudinal care. Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality, including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g. those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths, and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality, low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.

Title: Energy Efficiency Maximization for CR-NOMA based Smart Grid Communication Network
Authors: Mubashar Sarfraz, Sheraz Alam, Sajjad A. Ghauri, Asad Mahmood
Abstract: Managing massive data flows effectively and resolving spectrum shortages are two challenges that Smart Grid Communication Networks (SGCN) must overcome. To address these problems, we provide a combined optimization approach that makes use of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technologies. Our work focuses on using user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) techniques to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in SGCN, particularly within Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs). We develop a joint optimization problem that takes into account the real-world limitations of a CR-NOMA setting. This problem is NP-hard, nonlinear, and nonconvex by nature. To address the computational complexity of the problem, we use the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, which breaks the problem into UP and PA subproblems. Initially, we proposed the Zebra-Optimization User Pairing (ZOUP) algorithm to tackle the UP problem, which outperforms both Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and non-optimized NOMA (UPWO) by 78.8\% and 13.6\%, respectively, at a SNR of 15 dB. Based on the ZOUP pairs, we subsequently proposed the PA approach, i.e., ZOUPPA, which significantly outperforms UPWO and ZOUP by 53.2\% and 25.4\%, respectively, at an SNR of 15 dB. A detailed analysis of key parameters, including varying SNRs, power allocation constants, path loss exponents, user density, channel availability, and coverage radius, underscores the superiority of our approach. By facilitating the effective use of communication resources in SGCN, our research opens the door to more intelligent and energy-efficient grid systems. Our work tackles important issues in SGCN and lays the groundwork for future developments in smart grid communication technologies by combining modern optimization approaches with CR-NOMA.

Title: Sensing Framework Design and Performance Optimization with Action Detection for ISCC
Authors: Weiwei Chen, Yinghui He, Guanding Yu, Jianfeng Wang, Haiyan Luo
Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) has been regarded as a prospective technology for the next-generation wireless network, supporting humancentric intelligent applications. However, the delay sensitivity of these computation-intensive applications, especially in a multidevice ISCC system with limited resources, highlights the urgent need for efficient sensing task execution frameworks. To address this, we propose a resource-efficient sensing framework in this paper. Different from existing solutions, it features a novel action detection module deployed at each device to detect the onset of an action. Only time windows filled with signals of interest are offloaded to the edge server and processed by the edge recognition module, thus reducing overhead. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the sensing performance of the proposed sensing framework and formulate a sensing accuracy maximization problem under power, delay, and resource limitations for the multi-device ISCC system. By decomposing it into two subproblems, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed algorithm. It alternatively solves a sensing accuracy maximization subproblem at each device and employs a closed-form computation resource allocation strategy at the edge server till convergence. Finally, a real-world test is conducted using commodity wireless devices to validate the sensing performance analysis. Extensive test results demonstrate that our proposal achieves higher sensing accuracy under the limited resource compared to two baselines.

Title: Maximal Compatibility Matching for Preference-Aware Ride-Hailing Systems
Authors: Avalpreet Singh Brar, Rong Su, Jaskaranveer Kaur, Xinling Li, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: This paper presents the Maximal Compatibility Matching (MCM) framework, a novel assignment strategy for ride-hailing systems that explicitly incorporates passenger comfort into the matching process. Traditional assignment methods prioritize spatial efficiency, but often overlook behavioral alignment between passengers and drivers, which can significantly impact user satisfaction. MCM addresses this gap by learning personalized passenger comfort zones using gradient-boosted decision tree classifiers trained on labeled ride data, and by modeling driver behavior through empirical operating profiles constructed from time-series driving features. Compatibility between a passenger and a driver is computed as the closed-form volume of intersection between their respective feature-space regions. These compatibility scores are integrated into a utility-based matching algorithm that balances comfort and proximity through a tunable trade-off parameter. We validate the framework using a Unity-based driving simulator with real-time passenger feedback, demonstrating that MCM enables more personalized and socially acceptable matchings while maintaining high levels of operational performance.

Title: Wise Goose Chase: A Predictive Path Planning Algorithm for Dynamic Rebalancing in Ride-Hailing Systems
Authors: Avalpreet Singh Brar, Rong Su, Christos G. Cassandras, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Traditional rebalancing methods in ride-hailing systems direct idle drivers to fixed destinations, overlooking the fact that ride allocations frequently occur while cruising. This destination-centric view fails to exploit the path-dependent nature of modern platforms, where real-time matching depends on the entire trajectory rather than a static endpoint. We propose the Wise Goose Chase (WGC) algorithm, an event-triggered, driver-specific path planning framework that anticipates future matching opportunities by forecasting spatio-temporal supply and demand dynamics. WGC uses a system of Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs) to model the evolution of idle driver density and passenger queues at the road-segment level, incorporating both en-route matching and competition among drivers. Upon request, WGC computes personalized cruising paths that minimize each driver's expected time to allocation. Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic urban networks show that WGC consistently outperforms baseline strategies, highlighting the advantage of predictive, context-aware rebalancing in dynamic mobility systems.

Title: Multi-dimensional Parameter Estimation in RIS-aided MU-MIMO Channels
Authors: Linlin Mo, Yi Song, Fabio Saggese, Xinhua Lu, Zhongyong Wang, Petar Popovski
Abstract: We address the channel estimation problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided broadband systems by proposing a dual-structure and multi-dimensional transformations (DS-MDT) algorithm. The proposed approach leverages the dual-structure features of the channel parameters to assist users experiencing weaker channel conditions, thereby enhancing estimation performance. Moreover, given that the channel parameters are distributed across multiple dimensions of the received tensor, the proposed algorithm employs multi-dimensional transformations to effectively isolate and extract distinct parameters. The numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm reduces the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by up to 10 dB while maintaining lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Lane-Wise Highway Anomaly Detection
Authors: Mei Qiu, William Lorenz Reindl, Yaobin Chen, Stanley Chien, Shu Hu
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable and interpretable framework for lane-wise highway traffic anomaly detection, leveraging multi-modal time series data extracted from surveillance cameras. Unlike traditional sensor-dependent methods, our approach uses AI-powered vision models to extract lane-specific features, including vehicle count, occupancy, and truck percentage, without relying on costly hardware or complex road modeling. We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent transportation systems.

Title: DeepSparse: A Foundation Model for Sparse-View CBCT Reconstruction
Authors: Yiqun Lin, Hualiang Wang, Jixiang Chen, Jiewen Yang, Jiarong Guo, Xiaomeng Li
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a critical 3D imaging technology in the medical field, while the high radiation exposure required for high-quality imaging raises significant concerns, particularly for vulnerable populations. Sparse-view reconstruction reduces radiation by using fewer X-ray projections while maintaining image quality, yet existing methods face challenges such as high computational demands and poor generalizability to different datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose DeepSparse, the first foundation model for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, featuring DiCE (Dual-Dimensional Cross-Scale Embedding), a novel network that integrates multi-view 2D features and multi-scale 3D features. Additionally, we introduce the HyViP (Hybrid View Sampling Pretraining) framework, which pretrains the model on large datasets with both sparse-view and dense-view projections, and a two-step finetuning strategy to adapt and refine the model for new datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed DeepSparse achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, paving the way for safer and more efficient CBCT imaging.

Title: Online Phase Estimation of Human Oscillatory Motions using Deep Learning
Authors: Antonio Grotta, Francesco De Lellis
Abstract: Accurately estimating the phase of oscillatory systems is essential for analyzing cyclic activities such as repetitive gestures in human motion. In this work we introduce a learning-based approach for online phase estimation in three-dimensional motion trajectories, using a Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) network. A calibration procedure is applied to standardize trajectory position and orientation, ensuring invariance to spatial variations. The proposed model is evaluated on motion capture data and further tested in a dynamical system, where the estimated phase is used as input to a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control to assess its impact on the synchronization of a network of Kuramoto oscillators.

Title: Multi-View Learning with Context-Guided Receptance for Image Denoising
Authors: Binghong Chen, Tingting Chai, Wei Jiang, Yuanrong Xu, Guanglu Zhou, Xiangqian Wu
Abstract: Image denoising is essential in low-level vision applications such as photography and automated driving. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing complex noise patterns in real-world scenes and consume significant computational resources due to reliance on Transformer-based models. In this work, the Context-guided Receptance Weighted Key-Value (\M) model is proposed, combining enhanced multi-view feature integration with efficient sequence modeling. Our approach introduces the Context-guided Token Shift (CTS) paradigm, which effectively captures local spatial dependencies and enhance the model's ability to model real-world noise distributions. Additionally, the Frequency Mix (FMix) module extracting frequency-domain features is designed to isolate noise in high-frequency spectra, and is integrated with spatial representations through a multi-view learning process. To improve computational efficiency, the Bidirectional WKV (BiWKV) mechanism is adopted, enabling full pixel-sequence interaction with linear complexity while overcoming the causal selection constraints. The model is validated on multiple real-world image denoising datasets, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and reducing inference time up to 40\%. Qualitative results further demonstrate the ability of our model to restore fine details in various scenes.

We illustrate the feasibility of the FRN architecture in multiple case studies.

Title: Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changing using Decentralised Safety Shields
Authors: Bharathkumar Hegde, Melanie Bouroche
Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities, such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.

Title: Embedded System for Recording and Controlling Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Environments
Authors: Rafael Castro, Alexandre dos Santos Roque
Abstract: Nowadays, more effective control of hand hygiene (HH) by healthcare teams has become essential. HH control is crucial to prevent cross-contamination and healthcare-associated infections (HAI), according to Brazilian regulatory standards and WHO guidelines. The lack of widespread technology to measure acceptable hygiene rates within hospital environments leads to the practice of a manual sample audit reading, requiring more time for decision making. Thus, the present study addresses the lack of automation technologies for HH, aiming to record, measure, and provide data for internal audits in hospitals. This article introduces an embedded system for HH control and recording, comprising low-cost hardware architecture with IoT connectivity and online monitoring. Results with practical evaluation in a real hospital setting for 3 hours demonstrated the system's effectiveness in recording HH indices.

Title: High Speed Robotic Table Tennis Swinging Using Lightweight Hardware with Model Predictive Control
Authors: David Nguyen, Kendrick D. Cancio, Sangbae Kim
Abstract: We present a robotic table tennis platform that achieves a variety of hit styles and ball-spins with high precision, power, and consistency. This is enabled by a custom lightweight, high-torque, low rotor inertia, five degree-of-freedom arm capable of high acceleration. To generate swing trajectories, we formulate an optimal control problem (OCP) that constrains the state of the paddle at the time of the strike. The terminal position is given by a predicted ball trajectory, and the terminal orientation and velocity of the paddle are chosen to match various possible styles of hits: loops (topspin), drives (flat), and chops (backspin). Finally, we construct a fixed-horizon model predictive controller (MPC) around this OCP to allow the hardware to quickly react to changes in the predicted ball trajectory. We validate on hardware that the system is capable of hitting balls with an average exit velocity of 11 m/s at an 88% success rate across the three swing types.

Title: Toward Onboard AI-Enabled Solutions to Space Object Detection for Space Sustainability
Authors: Wenxuan Zhang, Peng Hu
Abstract: The rapid expansion of advanced low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in large constellations is positioning space assets as key to the future, enabling global internet access and relay systems for deep space missions. A solution to the challenge is effective space object detection (SOD) for collision assessment and avoidance. In SOD, an LEO satellite must detect other satellites and objects with high precision and minimal delay. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing vision sensors for SOD tasks based on deep learning (DL) models. It introduces models based on the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layer, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and evaluates their performance under SOD scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed models achieve mean average precision at intersection over union threshold 0.5 (mAP50) scores of up to 0.751 and mean average precision averaged over intersection over union thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP50:95) scores of up to 0.280. Compared to the baseline GELAN-t model, the proposed GELAN-ViT-SE model increases the average mAP50 from 0.721 to 0.751, improves the mAP50:95 from 0.266 to 0.274, reduces giga floating point operations (GFLOPs) from 7.3 to 5.6, and lowers peak power consumption from 2080.7 mW to 2028.7 mW by 2.5\%.

Title: Sensing Safety Analysis for Vehicular Networks with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
Authors: Tingyu Shui, Walid Saad, Mingzhe Cheng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing safety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically adjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular user (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve spoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the RIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect to the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly misled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity estimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can cause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\circ} with only a 5^{\circ} beam misalignment.

Title: Switched Systems Control via Discreteness-Promoting Regularization
Authors: Masaaki Nagahara, Takuya Ikeda, Ritsuki Hoshimoto
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for designing finite-horizon discrete-valued switching signals in linear switched systems based on discreteness-promoting regularization. The inherent combinatorial optimization problem is reformulated as a continuous optimization problem with a non-convex regularization term that promotes discreteness of the control. We prove that any solution obtained from the relaxed problem is also a solution to the original problem. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved through time discretization. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Smoothness of the Augmented Lagrangian Dual in Convex Optimization
Authors: Jingwang Li, Vincent Lau
Abstract: This paper investigates the general linearly constrained optimization problem: $\min_{x \in \R^d} f(x) \ \st \ A x = b$, where $f: \R^n \rightarrow \exs$ is a closed proper convex function, $A \in \R^{p \times d}$, and $b \in \R^p$. We establish the following results without requiring additional regularity conditions: (1) the augmented Lagrangian dual function $\phi_{\rho}(\lambda) = \inf_x \cL_{\rho}(x, \lambda)$ is $\frac{1}{\rho}$-smooth everywhere; and (2) the solution to $\min_{x \in \R^d} \cL_{\rho}(x, \lambda)$ exists for any dual variable $\lambda \in \R^p$, where $\rho > 0$ is the augmented parameter and $\cL_{\rho}(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \dotprod{\lambda, A x - b} + \frac{\rho}{2}\norm{A x - b}^2$ is the augmented Lagrangian. These findings significantly relax the strong assumptions commonly imposed in existing literature to guarantee similar properties.

Title: ResiTok: A Resilient Tokenization-Enabled Framework for Ultra-Low-Rate and Robust Image Transmission
Authors: Zhenyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Real-time transmission of visual data over wireless networks remains highly challenging, even when leveraging advanced deep neural networks, particularly under severe channel conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel Resilient Tokenization-Enabled (ResiTok) framework designed for ultra-low-rate image transmission that achieves exceptional robustness while maintaining high reconstruction quality. By reorganizing visual information into hierarchical token groups consisting of essential key tokens and supplementary detail tokens, ResiTok enables progressive encoding and graceful degradation of visual quality under constrained channel conditions. A key contribution is our resilient 1D tokenization method integrated with a specialized zero-out training strategy, which systematically simulates token loss during training, empowering the neural network to effectively compress and reconstruct images from incomplete token sets. Furthermore, the channel-adaptive coding and modulation design dynamically allocates coding resources according to prevailing channel conditions, yielding superior semantic fidelity and structural consistency even at extremely low channel bandwidth ratios. Evaluation results demonstrate that ResiTok outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic similarity and visual quality, with significant advantages under challenging channel conditions.

Title: Weakly-supervised Audio Temporal Forgery Localization via Progressive Audio-language Co-learning Network
Authors: Junyan Wu, Wenbo Xu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Rui Yang, Shize Guo
Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.

Title: Parameter Sensitivity Analysis in Zinc-Ion Batteries: A Study on Ionic Conductivity, Current Density, and Electrode Properties
Authors: Roya Rajabi, Shichen Sun, Booker Wu, Jamil Khan, Kevin Huang
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive Multiphysics model for zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), incorporating electrochemical aspects. The model integrates the mass transport of Zn2+ ions, charge transfer, and solid diffusion to predict performance parameters like cell potential, and energy density. Significant research has focused on enhancing battery performance by optimizing components of battery to improve parameters such as ionic conductivity and exchange current density and capacity. In this study, we present a model-based investigation of zinc-ion batteries, examining the impact of these parameters. Our findings reveal that at low current densities, raising of ionic conductivity beyond 1.3 S/m and exchange current density above 0.13 mA/cm2 do not yield substantial improvements in capacity. These insights underscore the importance of identifying performance thresholds in the development of next-generation batteries.

Title: Towards Sustainable Energy Storage: Evaluating Polymer Electrolytes for Zinc Ion Batteries
Authors: Roya Rajabi, Shichen Sun, Booker Wu, Jamil Khan, Kevin Huang
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes present a promising solution to the challenges posed by aqueous electrolytes in energy storage systems, offering the flexibility needed for wearable electronics. Despite the increasing interest in polymer electrolyte-based zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), their development is still in its early stages due to various challenges. In this study, we fabricated three promising polymer electrolytes: CSAM (carboxyl methyl chitosan with acrylamide monomer), PAM (polyacrylamide monomer hydrogel electrolyte), and p-PBI (Phosphoric acid (PA)-doped polybenzimidazole) with Zn(ClO4)2 and Zn(OTf)2, for their application in zinc ion batteries. Our results demonstrated that PAM hydrogel electrolyte exhibited very low LDH formation after a long cycle, demonstrating effective protection for zinc foil, and the high mechanical stability of the p-PBI membrane provided prolonged durability against short circuits through the formation of LDH. The presence of carboxyl groups in CSAM and the formation of O-H bonding facilitated ion movement, resulting in enhanced ionic conductivity, and preventing dendrite formation. Incorporating these hydrogels with high-performance zinc salts, such as zinc triflate (Zn(OTf)2), resulted in impressive stability, with the symmetric cell demonstrating over 4000 hours of uniform and stable voltage profile under 1 mA/cm2 and low overpotential of around 53 mV cycling with CSAM. The full-cell battery with PBI-T membrane showed the highest durability and capacity compared to CSAM-T and PAM-T, due to the greater availability of free protons for storing zinc in the cathode.

Title: OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer
Authors: Nikolaos Louloudakis, Ajitha Rajan
Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.

Authors: Ali Al-Bustami, Humberto Ruiz-Ochoa, Jaerock Kwon
Abstract: Validating autonomous driving neural networks often demands expensive equipment and complex setups, limiting accessibility for researchers and educators. We introduce DriveNetBench, an affordable and configurable benchmarking system designed to evaluate autonomous driving networks using a single-camera setup. Leveraging low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware, and a flexible software stack, DriveNetBench enables easy integration of various driving models, such as object detection and lane following, while ensuring standardized evaluation in real-world scenarios. Our system replicates common driving conditions and provides consistent, repeatable metrics for comparing network performance. Through preliminary experiments with representative vision models, we illustrate how DriveNetBench effectively measures inference speed and accuracy within a controlled test environment. The key contributions of this work include its affordability, its replicability through open-source software, and its seamless integration into existing workflows, making autonomous vehicle research more accessible.

Title: Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling
Authors: Javier E. Santos, Agnese Marcato, Roman Colman, Nicholas Lubbers, Yen Ting Lin
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.

Title: Triple-identity Authentication: The Future of Secure Access
Authors: Suyun Borjigin
Abstract: In a typical authentication process, the local system verifies the user's identity using a stored hash value generated by a cross-system hash algorithm. This article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to the establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between a system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity authentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system opens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials, including the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a login credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a unique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the open algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather than the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the user's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered credential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is implemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password field, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this triple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping mechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security that is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.

Title: Dual Acceleration for Minimax Optimization: Linear Convergence Under Relaxed Assumptions
Authors: Jingwang Li, Xiao Li
Abstract: This paper addresses the bilinearly coupled minimax optimization problem: $\min_{x \in \R^{d_x}}\max_{y \in \R^{d_y}} \ f_1(x) + f_2(x) + y\T Bx - g_1(y) - g_2(y)$, where $f_1$ and $g_1$ are smooth convex functions, $f_2$ and $g_2$ are potentially nonsmooth convex functions, and $B$ is a coupling matrix. Existing algorithms for solving this problem achieve linear convergence only under stronger conditions, which may not be met in many scenarios. We first introduce the Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient (PDPG) method and demonstrate that it converges linearly under an assumption where existing algorithms fail to achieve linear convergence. Building on insights gained from analyzing the convergence conditions of existing algorithms and PDPG, we further propose the inexact Dual Accelerated Proximal Gradient (iDAPG) method. This method achieves linear convergence under weaker conditions than those required by existing approaches. Moreover, even in cases where existing methods guarantee linear convergence, iDAPG can still provide superior theoretical performance in certain scenarios.

Title: MaskClip: Detachable Clip-on Piezoelectric Sensing of Mask Surface Vibrations for Real-time Noise-Robust Speech Input
Authors: Hirotaka Hiraki, Jun Rekimoto
Abstract: Masks are essential in medical settings and during infectious outbreaks but significantly impair speech communication, especially in environments with background noise. Existing solutions often require substantial computational resources or compromise hygiene and comfort. We propose a novel sensing approach that captures only the wearer's voice by detecting mask surface vibrations using a piezoelectric sensor. Our developed device, MaskClip, employs a stainless steel clip with an optimally positioned piezoelectric sensor to selectively capture speech vibrations while inherently filtering out ambient noise. Evaluation experiments demonstrated superior performance with a low Character Error Rate of 6.1\% in noisy environments compared to conventional microphones. Subjective evaluations by 102 participants also showed high satisfaction scores. This approach shows promise for applications in settings where clear voice communication must be maintained while wearing protective equipment, such as medical facilities, cleanrooms, and industrial environments.

Title: CONQURE: A Co-Execution Environment for Quantum and Classical Resources
Authors: Atulya Mahesh, Swastik Mittal, Frank Mueller
Abstract: Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.

Title: Resolving Conflicting Constraints in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Layered Safety
Authors: Jason J. Choi, Jasmine Jerry Aloor, Jingqi Li, Maria G. Mendoza, Hamsa Balakrishnan, Claire J. Tomlin
Abstract: Preventing collisions in multi-robot navigation is crucial for deployment. This requirement hinders the use of learning-based approaches, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), on their own due to their lack of safety guarantees. Traditional control methods, such as reachability and control barrier functions, can provide rigorous safety guarantees when interactions are limited only to a small number of robots. However, conflicts between the constraints faced by different agents pose a challenge to safe multi-agent coordination. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method that integrates multiple layers of safety by combining MARL with safety filters. First, MARL is used to learn strategies that minimize multiple agent interactions, where multiple indicates more than two. Particularly, we focus on interactions likely to result in conflicting constraints within the engagement distance. Next, for agents that enter the engagement distance, we prioritize pairs requiring the most urgent corrective actions. Finally, a dedicated safety filter provides tactical corrective actions to resolve these conflicts. Crucially, the design decisions for all layers of this framework are grounded in reachability analysis and a control barrier-value function-based filtering mechanism. We validate our Layered Safe MARL framework in 1) hardware experiments using Crazyflie drones and 2) high-density advanced aerial mobility (AAM) operation scenarios, where agents navigate to designated waypoints while avoiding collisions. The results show that our method significantly reduces conflict while maintaining safety without sacrificing much efficiency (i.e., shorter travel time and distance) compared to baselines that do not incorporate layered safety.

Title: Riemannian Direct Trajectory Optimization of Rigid Bodies on Matrix Lie Groups
Authors: Sangli Teng, Tzu-Yuan Lin, William A Clark, Ram Vasudevan, Maani Ghaffari
Abstract: Designing dynamically feasible trajectories for rigid bodies is a fundamental problem in robotics. Although direct trajectory optimization is widely applied to solve this problem, inappropriate parameterizations of rigid body dynamics often result in slow convergence and violations of the intrinsic topological structure of the rotation group. This paper introduces a Riemannian optimization framework for direct trajectory optimization of rigid bodies. We first use the Lie Group Variational Integrator to formulate the discrete rigid body dynamics on matrix Lie groups. We then derive the closed-form first- and second-order Riemannian derivatives of the dynamics. Finally, this work applies a line-search Riemannian Interior Point Method (RIPM) to perform trajectory optimization with general nonlinear constraints. As the optimization is performed on matrix Lie groups, it is correct-by-construction to respect the topological structure of the rotation group and be free of singularities. The paper demonstrates that both the derivative evaluations and Newton steps required to solve the RIPM exhibit linear complexity with respect to the planning horizon and system degrees of freedom. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is faster than conventional methods by an order of magnitude in challenging robotics tasks.

Title: Probabilistic ODMA Receiver with Low-Complexity Algorithm for MIMO Unsourced Random Access
Authors: Zhentian Zhang, Jian Dang, Zaichen Zhang
Abstract: In this work, we present the design for both pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free on-off multiple access (ODMA) receivers in unsourced random access (URA) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike pilot-coupled ODMA, where on-off patterns are linked to pilot selection, pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free ODMA reduce transmission redundancy but face challenges in processing complexity and capacity performance. The joint pattern and data detector (JPDD) design is critical for these schemes, but the current JPDD algorithm has high complexity with quadratic computational costs. To address this, we propose a low-complexity detector based on approximate message passing (AMP), which offers linear complexity, providing reduced cost and improved performance in the under-determined linear regression case. Decoding is initialized via pilot-free matrix factorization through alternating minimization, resolving phase and scalar ambiguities. Compared to existing pilot-free schemes, the proposed method achieves a 13 dB improvement and favorable trade-offs in complexity and capacity performance when compared to benchmarks.

Title: A Real-Time Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filter for Motion Planning with Arbitrary Road Boundary Constraints
Authors: Jianye Xu, Chang Che, Bassam Alrifaee
Abstract: We present a real-time safety filter for motion planning, such as learning-based methods, using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which provides formal guarantees for collision avoidance with road boundaries. A key feature of our approach is its ability to directly incorporate road geometries of arbitrary shape without resorting to conservative overapproximations. We formulate the safety filter as a constrained optimization problem in the form of a Quadratic Program (QP). It achieves safety by making minimal, necessary adjustments to the control actions issued by the nominal motion planner. We validate our safety filter through extensive numerical experiments across a variety of traffic scenarios featuring complex roads. The results confirm its reliable safety and high computational efficiency (execution frequency up to 40 Hz). Code & Video Demo: this http URL

Title: Quadrupedal Spine Control Strategies: Exploring Correlations Between System Dynamic Responses and Human Perspectives
Authors: Nicholas Hafner, Chaoran Liu, Carlos Ishi, Hiroshi Ishiguro
Abstract: Unlike their biological cousins, the majority of existing quadrupedal robots are constructed with rigid chassis. This results in motion that is either beetle-like or distinctly robotic, lacking the natural fluidity characteristic of mammalian movements. Existing literature on quadrupedal robots with spinal configurations primarily focuses on energy efficiency and does not consider the effects in human-robot interaction scenarios. Our contributions include an initial investigation into various trajectory generation strategies for a quadrupedal robot with a four degree of freedom spine, and an analysis on the effect that such methods have on human perception of gait naturalness compared to a fixed spine baseline. The strategies were evaluated using videos of walking, trotting and turning simulations. Among the four different strategies developed, the optimised time varying and the foot-tracking strategies were perceived to be more natural than the baseline in a randomised trial with 50 participants. Although none of the strategies demonstrated any energy efficiency improvements over the no-spine baseline, some showed greater footfall consistency at higher speeds. Given the greater likeability drawn from the more natural locomotion patterns, this type of robot displays potential for applications in social robot scenarios such as elderly care, where energy efficiency is not a primary concern.

Title: ReeM: Ensemble Building Thermodynamics Model for Efficient HVAC Control via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yang Deng, Yaohui Liu, Rui Liang, Dafang Zhao, Donghua Xie, Ittetsu Taniguchi, Dan Wang
Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Cooperative ISAC Network for Off-Grid Imaging-based Low-Altitude Surveillance
Authors: Yixuan Huang, Jie Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shuqiang Xia, Xiao Li, Shi Jin
Abstract: The low-altitude economy has emerged as a critical focus for future economic development, emphasizing the urgent need for flight activity surveillance utilizing the existing sensing capabilities of mobile cellular networks. Traditional monostatic or localization-based sensing methods, however, encounter challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that directly draws the radio images of the low-altitude space, leveraging its inherent sparsity with compressed sensing (CS)-based algorithms and the cooperation of multiple base stations. Furthermore, recognizing that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are randomly distributed in space, we introduce a physics-embedded learning method to overcome off-grid issues inherent in CS-based models. Additionally, an online hard example mining method is incorporated into the design of the loss function, enabling the network to adaptively concentrate on the samples bearing significant discrepancy with the ground truth, thereby enhancing its ability to detect the rare UAVs within the expansive low-altitude space. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the imaging-based low-altitude surveillance approach, with the proposed physics-embedded learning algorithm significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions.

Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Integrated Communication and Localization with a Single Access Point
Authors: Xiyu Wang, Yixuan Huang, Jie Yang, Yu Han, Shi Jin
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) not only assist communication but also help the localization of user equipment (UE). This study focuses on the indoor localization of UE with a single access point (AP) aided by multiple RISs. First, we propose a two-stage channel estimation scheme where the phase shifts of RIS elements are tuned to obtain multiple channel soundings. In the first stage, the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm extracts the parameters of multiple paths from the received signals. Then, the LOS path and RIS-reflected paths are identified. In the second stage, the estimated path gains of RIS-reflected paths with different phase shifts are utilized to determine the angle of arrival (AOA) at the RIS by obtaining the angular pseudo spectrum. Consequently, by taking the AP and RISs as reference points, the linear least squares estimator can locate UE with the estimated AOAs. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can realize centimeter-level localization accuracy in the discussed scenarios. Moreover, the higher accuracy of pseudo spectrum, a larger number of channel soundings, and a larger number of reference points can realize higher localization accuracy of UE.

Title: Learned Intelligent Recognizer with Adaptively Customized RIS Phases in Communication Systems
Authors: Yixuan Huang, Jie Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shuqiang Xia, Xiao Li, Shi Jin
Abstract: This study presents an advanced wireless system that embeds target recognition within reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communication systems, powered by cuttingedge deep learning innovations. Such a system faces the challenge of fine-tuning both the RIS phase shifts and neural network (NN) parameters, since they intricately interdepend on each other to accomplish the recognition task. To address these challenges, we propose an intelligent recognizer that strategically harnesses every piece of prior action responses, thereby ingeniously multiplexing downlink signals to facilitate environment sensing. Specifically, we design a novel NN based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture and the physical channel model. The NN iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements and adaptively customizes RIS configurations to acquire the most relevant information for the recognition task in subsequent moments. Tailored dynamically, these configurations adapt to the scene, task, and target specifics. Simulation results reveal that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, while resulting in minimal impacts on communication performance, even as sensing is performed simultaneously.

Abstract: This paper presents ZeloS, a research platform designed and built for practical validation of automated driving methods in an early stage of research. We overview ZeloS' hardware setup and automation architecture and focus on motion planning and control. ZeloS weighs 69 kg, measures a length of 117 cm, and is equipped with all-wheel steering, all-wheel drive, and various onboard sensors for localization. The hardware setup and the automation architecture of ZeloS are designed and built with a focus on modularity and the goal of being simple yet effective. The modular design allows the modification of individual automation modules without the need for extensive onboarding into the automation architecture. As such, this design supports ZeloS in being a versatile research platform for validating various automated driving methods. The motion planning component and control of ZeloS feature optimization-based methods that allow for explicitly considering constraints. We demonstrate the hardware and automation setup by presenting experimental data.

Title: Point Cloud Recombination: Systematic Real Data Augmentation Using Robotic Targets for LiDAR Perception Validation
Authors: Hubert Padusinski, Christian Steinhauser, Christian Scherl, Julian Gaal, Jacob Langner
Abstract: The validation of LiDAR-based perception of intelligent mobile systems operating in open-world applications remains a challenge due to the variability of real environmental conditions. Virtual simulations allow the generation of arbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor characteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In contrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control over influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches address this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by transferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider validation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical data. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which systematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds acquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory environments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of repeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware occlusions with registered 3D meshes. Using the Ouster OS1-128 Rev7 sensor, we demonstrate the augmentation of real-world urban and rural scenes with humanoid targets featuring varied clothing and poses, for repeatable positioning. We show that the recombined scenes closely match real sensor outputs, enabling targeted testing, scalable failure analysis, and improved system safety. By providing controlled yet sensor-realistic data, our method enables trustworthy conclusions about the limitations of specific sensors in compound with their algorithms, e.g., object detection.

Authors: MohammadAli Shaeri, Jinhan Liu, Mahsa Shoaran
Abstract: Advanced neural interfaces are transforming applications ranging from neuroscience research to diagnostic tools (for mental state recognition, tremor and seizure detection) as well as prosthetic devices (for motor and communication recovery). By integrating complex functions into miniaturized neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning (ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices. Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.

Title: Data-Driven Energy Modeling of Industrial IoT Systems: A Benchmarking Approach
Authors: Dimitris Kallis, Moysis Symeonides, Marios D. Dikaiakos
Abstract: The widespread adoption of IoT has driven the development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in industrial environments, leveraging Industrial IoTs (IIoTs) to automate manufacturing processes and enhance productivity. The transition to autonomous systems introduces significant operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. Accurate modeling and prediction of IIoT energy requirements are critical, but traditional physics- and engineering-based approaches often fall short in addressing these challenges comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for benchmarking and analyzing IIoT devices and applications to uncover insights into their power demands, energy consumption, and performance. To demonstrate this methodology, we develop a comprehensive framework and apply it to study an industrial CPS comprising an educational robotic arm, a conveyor belt, a smart camera, and a compute node. By creating micro-benchmarks and an end-to-end application within this framework, we create an extensive performance and power consumption dataset, which we use to train and analyze ML models for predicting energy usage from features of the application and the CPS system. The proposed methodology and framework provide valuable insights into the energy dynamics of industrial CPS, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of IIoT-driven automation.

Title: Learning and Online Replication of Grasp Forces from Electromyography Signals for Prosthetic Finger Control
Authors: Robin Arbaud, Elisa Motta, Marco Domenico Avaro, Stefano Picinich, Marta Lorenzini, Arash Ajoudani
Abstract: Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered prostheses remains an open challenge. To address this gap, we developed a force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals. The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality of prosthetic fingers.

Title: LiDAR-Inertial SLAM-Based Navigation and Safety-Oriented AI-Driven Control System for Skid-Steer Robots
Authors: Mehdi Heydari Shahna, Eemil Haaparanta, Pauli Mustalahti, Jouni Mattila
Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and stochastic technologies into the mobile robot navigation and control (MRNC) framework while adhering to rigorous safety standards presents significant challenges. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensively integrated MRNC framework for skid-steer wheeled mobile robots (SSWMRs), in which all components are actively engaged in real-time execution. The framework comprises: 1) a LiDAR-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for estimating the current pose of the robot within the built map; 2) an effective path-following control system for generating desired linear and angular velocity commands based on the current pose and the desired pose; 3) inverse kinematics for transferring linear and angular velocity commands into left and right side velocity commands; and 4) a robust AI-driven (RAID) control system incorporating a radial basis function network (RBFN) with a new adaptive algorithm to enforce in-wheel actuation systems to track each side motion commands. To further meet safety requirements, the proposed RAID control within the MRNC framework of the SSWMR constrains AI-generated tracking performance within predefined overshoot and steady-state error limits, while ensuring robustness and system stability by compensating for modeling errors, unknown RBF weights, and external forces. Experimental results verify the proposed MRNC framework performance for a 4,836 kg SSWMR operating on soft terrain.

Title: Automatic Proficiency Assessment in L2 English Learners
Authors: Armita Mohammadi, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Patrick Cardinal
Abstract: Second language proficiency (L2) in English is usually perceptually evaluated by English teachers or expert evaluators, with the inherent intra- and inter-rater variability. This paper explores deep learning techniques for comprehensive L2 proficiency assessment, addressing both the speech signal and its correspondent transcription. We analyze spoken proficiency classification prediction using diverse architectures, including 2D CNN, frequency-based CNN, ResNet, and a pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model. Additionally, we examine text-based proficiency assessment by fine-tuning a BERT language model within resource constraints. Finally, we tackle the complex task of spontaneous dialogue assessment, managing long-form audio and speaker interactions through separate applications of wav2vec 2.0 and BERT models. Results from experiments on EFCamDat and ANGLISH datasets and a private dataset highlight the potential of deep learning, especially the pretrained wav2vec 2.0 model, for robust automated L2 proficiency evaluation.

Authors: Qingkai Fang, Yan Zhou, Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng
Abstract: Real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction is an essential part of the next-generation human-computer interaction. Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data.

Title: fastabx: A library for efficient computation of ABX discriminability
Authors: Maxime Poli, Emmanuel Chemla, Emmanuel Dupoux
Abstract: We introduce fastabx, a high-performance Python library for building ABX discrimination tasks. ABX is a measure of the separation between generic categories of interest. It has been used extensively to evaluate phonetic discriminability in self-supervised speech representations. However, its broader adoption has been limited by the absence of adequate tools. fastabx addresses this gap by providing a framework capable of constructing any type of ABX task while delivering the efficiency necessary for rapid development cycles, both in task creation and in calculating distances between representations. We believe that fastabx will serve as a valuable resource for the broader representation learning community, enabling researchers to systematically investigate what information can be directly extracted from learned representations across several domains beyond speech processing.

Title: Spacing and Wavelength Tunable Frequency Comb
Authors: Yijia Cai, Zhixin Liu
Abstract: Optical frequency combs are increasingly used in applications such as optical communications, radio signal processing, and dual-comb spectroscopy. Many of these applications require a broad, flat spectrum with tunable center wavelength and tone spacing, while maintaining a consistent spectral profile. However, most existing OFC generators either lack tunability or cannot preserve their spectral shape during tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate a cavity-less OFC system based on an electro-optic comb combined with parametric spectral broadening, achieving tone spacing tunability from 25 to 32 GHz and wavelength tunability from 1548 to 1568 nm. Our OFC features high output power (greater than 2 W), broad bandwidth (greater than 90 nm), high optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR greater than 25 dB), and, critically, a preserved spectral profile. We show that this consistent spectral shape can be maintained by primarily adjusting the RF drive power and the gain of the optical amplifiers. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the spectral profile variations during tuning.

Title: Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT for IoT Networks
Authors: Mohammadali Mohammadi, Le-Nam Tran, Zahra Mobini, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.

Title: Structured Estimators: A New Perspective on Information Freshness
Authors: Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus, Nail Akar
Abstract: In recent literature, when modeling for information freshness in remote estimation settings, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators, meaning the remote estimate at any time is equal to the most recently received update. This is mainly due to its simplicity and ease of analysis. However, these martingale estimators are far from optimal in some cases, especially in pull-based update systems. For such systems, maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimum, but can be challenging to analyze. Here, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which retain useful characteristics from a MAP estimate while still being analytically tractable. Our proposed estimators move seamlessly from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator.

Title: The Loop Game: Quality Assessment and Optimization for Low-Light Image Enhancement
Authors: Danni Huang, Lingyu Zhu, Zihao Lin, Hanwei Zhu, Shiqi Wang, Baoliang Chen
Abstract: There is an increasing consensus that the design and optimization of low light image enhancement methods need to be fully driven by perceptual quality. With numerous approaches proposed to enhance low-light images, much less work has been dedicated to quality assessment and quality optimization of low-light enhancement. In this paper, to close the gap between enhancement and assessment, we propose a loop enhancement framework that produces a clear picture of how the enhancement of low-light images could be optimized towards better visual quality. In particular, we create a large-scale database for QUality assessment Of The Enhanced LOw-Light Image (QUOTE-LOL), which serves as the foundation in studying and developing objective quality assessment measures. The objective quality assessment measure plays a critical bridging role between visual quality and enhancement and is further incorporated in the optimization in learning the enhancement model towards perceptual optimally. Finally, we iteratively perform the enhancement and optimization tasks, enhancing the low-light images continuously. The superiority of the proposed scheme is validated based on various low-light scenes.

Title: Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization
Authors: Yiqi Zhao, Xinyi Yu, Matteo Sesia, Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh, Lars Lindemann
Abstract: We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.

Title: Exploring Challenges in Deep Learning of Single-Station Ground Motion Records
Authors: Ümit Mert Çağlar, Baris Yilmaz, Melek Türkmen, Erdem Akagündüz, Salih Tileylioglu
Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have demonstrated promising results across various applications within seismology and earthquake engineering. These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models truly extract meaningful patterns from these complex time-series signals remains underexplored. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. Our experimental results reveal a strong dependence on the highly correlated Primary (P) and Secondary (S) phase arrival times. These findings expose a critical gap in the current research landscape, highlighting the lack of robust methodologies for deep learning from single-station ground motion recordings that do not rely on auxiliary inputs.

Title: Joint Beamforming Design and Bit Allocation in Massive MIMO with Resolution-Adaptive ADCs
Authors: Mengyuan Ma, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Italo Atzeni, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as a promising technology for reducing power consumption and complexity in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems while maintaining satisfactory spectral and energy efficiencies (SE/EE). In this work, we first identify the essential properties of optimal quantization and leverage them to derive a closed-form approximation of the covariance matrix of the quantization distortion. The theoretical finding facilitates the system SE analysis in the presence of low-resolution ADCs. We then focus on the joint optimization of the transmit-receive beamforming and bit allocation to maximize the SE under constraints on the transmit power and the total number of active ADC bits. To solve the resulting mixed-integer problem, we first develop an efficient beamforming design for fixed ADC resolutions. Then, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm to iteratively optimize the ADC resolutions and beamforming matrices. Numerical results for a $64 \times 64$ MIMO system demonstrate that the proposed design offers $6\%$ improvement in both SE and EE with $40\%$ fewer active ADC bits compared with the uniform bit allocation. Furthermore, we numerically show that receiving more data streams with low-resolution ADCs can achieve higher SE and EE compared to receiving fewer data streams with high-resolution ADCs.

Abstract: The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs and achieve an enhanced digital resolution given a fixed quantization bit budget. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.

Title: Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis
Authors: Zeynab Kaseb, Stavros Orfanoudakis, Pedro P. Vergara, Peter Palensky
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.

Title: Defense Strategies for Autonomous Multi-agent Systems: Ensuring Safety and Resilience Under Exponentially Unbounded FDI Attacks
Authors: Yichao Wang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Dimitra Panagou, Shan Zuo
Abstract: False data injection attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous multi-agent systems (MASs). Existing attack-resilient control strategies generally have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety constraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and solving the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, an attack-resilient compensational signal is designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Finally, a SAAR controller is designed by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem integrating control barrier function (CBF) certified collision-free safety constraints. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for heterogeneous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.

Title: GRAPHITE: Graph-Based Interpretable Tissue Examination for Enhanced Explainability in Breast Cancer Histopathology
Authors: Raktim Kumar Mondol, Ewan K. A. Millar, Peter H. Graham, Lois Browne, Arcot Sowmya, Erik Meijering
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) in medical histopathology is essential for enhancing the interpretability and clinical trustworthiness of deep learning models in cancer diagnosis. However, the black-box nature of these models often limits their clinical adoption. We introduce GRAPHITE (Graph-based Interpretable Tissue Examination), a post-hoc explainable framework designed for breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. GRAPHITE employs a multiscale approach, extracting patches at various magnification levels, constructing an hierarchical graph, and utilising graph attention networks (GAT) with scalewise attention (SAN) to capture scale-dependent features. We trained the model on 140 tumour TMA cores and four benign whole slide images from which 140 benign samples were created, and tested it on 53 pathologist-annotated TMA samples. GRAPHITE outperformed traditional XAI methods, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.56, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, and a threshold robustness (ThR) of 0.70, indicating that the model maintains high performance across a wide range of thresholds. In clinical utility, GRAPHITE achieved the highest area under the decision curve (AUDC) of 4.17e+5, indicating reliable decision support across thresholds. These results highlight GRAPHITE's potential as a clinically valuable tool in computational pathology, providing interpretable visualisations that align with the pathologists' diagnostic reasoning and support precision medicine.

Title: Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Yunan Sun, Hao Xu, Chongjun Ouyang, Hongwen Yang
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the performance of near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems using rotatable movable antennas (RMAs). In the proposed RMA-enabled system, the positions and rotations of antennas at the base station (BS) are dynamically adjusted to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. Two designs are explored: i) a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cram$\text{é}$r-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and ii) a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, two alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms are proposed capitalizing on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed RMA-enabled system outperforms the conventional fixed-position antenna and non-rotatable movable antenna systems in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs and RMAs' rotations show a higher performance gain in communication-centric design; ii) the proposed optimization methods achieve the Pareto boundary in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs.

Title: Noise disturbance and lack of privacy: Modeling acoustic dissatisfaction in open-plan offices
Authors: Manuj Yadav, Jungsoo Kim, Valtteri Hongisto, Densil Cabrera, Richard de Dear
Abstract: Open-plan offices are well-known to be adversely affected by acoustic issues. This study aims to model acoustic dissatisfaction using measurements of room acoustics, sound environment during occupancy, and occupant surveys (n = 349) in 28 offices representing a diverse range of workplace parameters. As latent factors, the contribution of $\textit{lack of privacy}$ (LackPriv) was 25% higher than $\textit{noise disturbance}$ (NseDstrb) in predicting $\textit{acoustic dissatisfaction}$ (AcDsat). Room acoustic metrics based on sound pressure level (SPL) decay of speech ($L_{\text{p,A,s,4m}}$ and $r_{\text{C}}$) were better in predicting these factors than distraction distance ($r_{\text{D}}$) based on speech transmission index. This contradicts previous findings, and the trends for SPL-based metrics in predicting AcDsat and LackPriv go against expectations based on ISO 3382-3. For sound during occupation, $L_{\text{A,90}}$ and psychoacoustic loudness ($N_{\text{90}}$) predicted AcDsat, and a SPL fluctuation metric ($M_{\text{A,eq}}$) predicted LackPriv. However, these metrics were weaker predictors than ISO 3382-3 metrics. Medium-sized offices exhibited higher dissatisfaction than larger ($\geq$50 occupants) offices. Dissatisfaction varied substantially across parameters including ceiling heights, number of workstations, and years of work, but not between offices with fixed seating compared to more flexible and activity-based working configurations. Overall, these findings highlight the complexities in characterizing occupants' perceptions using instrumental acoustic measurements.

Title: Deep learning model for ECG reconstruction reveals the information content of ECG leads
Authors: Tomasz Gradowski, Teodor Buchner
Abstract: This study introduces a deep learning model based on the U-net architecture to reconstruct missing leads in electrocardiograms (ECGs). The model was trained to reconstruct 12-lead ECG data from reduced lead configurations using publicly available datasets. The results highlight the ability of the model to quantify the information content of each ECG lead and its inter-lead correlations. This has significant implications for optimizing lead selection in diagnostic scenarios, particularly in settings where complete 12-lead ECGs are impractical. In addition, the study provides insights into the physiological underpinnings of ECG signals and their propagation. The findings pave the way for advances in telemedicine, portable ECG devices, and personalized cardiac diagnostics by reducing redundancy and improving signal interpretation.

Title: A Systematic Literature Review on Safety of the Intended Functionality for Automated Driving Systems
Authors: Milin Patel, Rolf Jung, Marzana Khatun
Abstract: In the automobile industry, ensuring the safety of automated vehicles equipped with the Automated Driving System (ADS) is becoming a significant focus due to the increasing development and deployment of automated driving. Automated driving depends on sensing both the external and internal environments of a vehicle, utilizing perception sensors and algorithms, and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems for situational awareness and response. ISO 21448 is the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) that aims to ensure that the ADS operate safely within their intended functionality. SOTIF focuses on preventing or mitigating potential hazards that may arise from the limitations or failures of the ADS, including hazards due to insufficiencies of specification, or performance insufficiencies, as well as foreseeable misuse of the intended functionality. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the safety of vehicles despite the limited availability of extensive and systematic literature on SOTIF. To address this challenge, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SOTIF for the ADS is performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The objective is to methodically gather and analyze the existing literature on SOTIF. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) presenting a summary of the literature by synthesizing and organizing the collective findings, methodologies, and insights into distinct thematic groups, and (ii) summarizing and categorizing the acknowledged limitations based on data extracted from an SLR of 51 research papers published between 2018 and 2023. Furthermore, research gaps are determined, and future research directions are proposed.

Title: Deep Neural OFDM Receivers: Two Novel Architectures for BER-BLER Optimization and Comparison with State-of-the-Art Architectures
Authors: Erhan Karakoca, Hüseyin Çevik, İbrahim Hökelek, Ali Görçin
Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models. The computational efficiency of the proposed neural receivers supports their feasibility for next generation communication systems.

Title: Precision yield estimation and mapping in manual strawberry harvesting with instrumented picking carts and a robust data processing pipeline
Authors: Uddhav Bhattarai, Rajkishan Arikapudi, Chen Peng, Steven A. Fennimore, Frank N Martin, Stavros G. Vougioukas
Abstract: High-resolution yield maps for manually harvested crops are impractical to generate on commercial scales because yield monitors are available only for mechanical harvesters. However, precision crop management relies on accurately determining spatial and temporal yield variability. This study presents the development of an integrated system for precision yield estimation and mapping for manually harvested strawberries. Conventional strawberry picking carts were instrumented with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and load cells to record real-time geo-tagged harvest data and cart motion. Extensive data were collected in two strawberry fields in California, USA, during a harvest season. To address the inconsistencies and errors caused by the sensors and the manual harvesting process, a robust data processing pipeline was developed by integrating supervised deep learning models with unsupervised algorithms. The pipeline was used to estimate the yield distribution and generate yield maps for season-long harvests at the desired grid resolution. The estimated yield distributions were used to calculate two metrics: the total mass harvested over specific row segments and the total mass of trays harvested. The metrics were compared to ground truth and achieved accuracies of 90.48% and 94.05%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimated yield based on the number of trays harvested per cart for season-long harvest was better than 94%. It showed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.99) with the actual number of counted trays in both fields. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical solution for specialty crops, assisting in efficient yield estimation and mapping, field management, and labor management for sustainable crop production.

Title: Data-Driven Reachability Analysis for Piecewise Affine Systems
Authors: Peng Xie, Johannes Betz, Davide M. Raimondo, Amr Alanwar
Abstract: Hybrid systems play a crucial role in modeling real-world applications where discrete and continuous dynamics interact, including autonomous vehicles, power systems, and traffic networks. Safety verification for these systems requires determining whether system states can enter unsafe regions under given initial conditions and uncertainties, a question directly addressed by reachability analysis. However, hybrid systems present unique difficulties because their state space is divided into multiple regions with distinct dynamic models, causing traditional data-driven methods to produce inadequate over-approximations of reachable sets at region boundaries where dynamics change abruptly. This paper introduces a novel approach using hybrid zonotopes for data-driven reachability analysis of piecewise affine systems. Our method addresses the boundary transition problem by developing computational algorithms that calculate the family of set models guaranteed to contain the true system trajectories. Additionally, we extend and evaluate three methods for set-based estimation that account for input-output data with measurement noise.

Title: Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Rectangular Index Coefficients
Authors: Saulo Queiroz, João P. Vilela, Benjamin Koon Kei Ng, Chan-Tong Lam, Edmundo Monteiro
Abstract: In~\cite{sic-magazine-2025}, the authors show that the square index coefficients (SICs) of the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) -- that is, the coefficients $X_{k\sqrt{N}}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, \sqrt{N} - 1$ -- can be losslessly compressed from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$ points, thereby accelerating the computation of these specific DFT coefficients accordingly. Following up on that, in this article we generalize SICs into what we refer to as rectangular index coefficients (RICs) of the DFT, formalized as $X_{kL}, k=0,1,\cdots,C-1$, in which the integers $C$ and $L$ are generic roots of $N$ such that $N=LC$. We present an algorithm to compress the $N$-point input signal $\mathbf{x}$ into a $C$-point signal $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ at the expense of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complex sums and no complex multiplication. We show that a DFT on $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ is equivalent to a DFT on the RICs of $\mathbf{x}$. In cases where specific frequencies of $\mathbf{x}$ are of interest -- as in harmonic analysis -- one can conveniently adjust the signal parameters (e.g., frequency resolution) to align the RICs with those frequencies, and use the proposed algorithm to compute them significantly faster. If $N$ is a power of two -- as required by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm -- then $C$ can be any power of two in the range $[2, N/2]$ and one can use our algorithm along with FFT to compute all RICs in $\mathcal{O}(C\log C)$ time complexity.

Title: Lightweight and Self-Evolving Channel Twinning: An Ensemble DMD-Assisted Approach
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Jintao Wang, Xu Shi, Wei Ni
Abstract: Traditional channel acquisition faces significant limitations due to ideal model assumptions and scalability challenges. A novel environment-aware paradigm, known as channel twinning, tackles these issues by constructing radio propagation environment semantics using a data-driven approach. In the spotlight of channel twinning technology, a radio map is recognized as an effective region-specific model for learning the spatial distribution of channel information. However, most studies focus on static channel map construction, with only a few collecting numerous channel samples and using deep learning for radio map prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic radio map twinning framework with a substantially small dataset. Specifically, we present an innovative approach that employs dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to model the evolution of the dynamic channel gain map as a dynamical system. We first interpret dynamic channel gain maps as spatio-temporal video stream data. The coarse-grained and fine-grained evolving modes are extracted from the stream data using a new ensemble DMD (Ens-DMD) algorithm. To mitigate the impact of noisy data, we design a median-based threshold mask technique to filter the noise artifacts of the twin maps. With the proposed DMD-based radio map twinning framework, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the low-complexity reproduction and evolution of the channel gain maps. Furthermore, we consider four radio map twin performance metrics to confirm the superiority of our framework compared to the baselines.

Title: Super-resolution Wideband Beam Training for Near-field Communications with Ultra-low Overhead
Authors: Cong Zhou, Changsheng You, Shuo Shi, Jiasi Zhou, Chenyu Wu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a super-resolution wideband beam training method for near-field communications, which is able to achieve ultra-low overhead. To this end, we first study the multi-beam characteristic of a sparse uniform linear array (S-ULA) in the wideband. Interestingly, we show that this leads to a new beam pattern property, called rainbow blocks, where the S-ULA generates multiple grating lobes and each grating lobe is further splitted into multiple versions in the wideband due to the well-known beam-split effect. As such, one directional beamformer based on S-ULA is capable of generating multiple rainbow blocks in the wideband, hence significantly extending the beam coverage. Then, by exploiting the beam-split effect in both the frequency and spatial domains, we propose a new three-stage wideband beam training method for extremely large-scale array (XL-array) systems. Specifically, we first sparsely activate a set of antennas at the central of the XL-array and judiciously design the time-delay (TD) parameters to estimate candidate user angles by comparing the received signal powers at the user over subcarriers. Next, to resolve the angular ambiguity introduced by the S-ULA, we activate all antennas in the central subarray and design an efficient subcarrier selection scheme to estimate the true user angle. In the third stage, we resolve the user range at the estimated user angle with high resolution by controlling the splitted beams over subcarriers to simultaneously cover the range domain. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed wideband beam training scheme, which only needs three pilots in near-field beam training, while achieving near-optimal rate performance.

Title: Physical-Layer Security in Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communication Systems
Authors: Tianyu Liu, Changsheng You, Cong Zhou, Yunpu Zhang, Shiqi Gong, Heng Liu, Guangchi Zhang
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology to improve the spectrum efficiency and spatial resolution of future wireless systems. Different from existing works that mostly considered physical layer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this paper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located in the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located in the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance, referred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs by optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the total BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a one-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the Bob in closed form. Interestingly, we show that the insecure-transmission region is significantly \emph{expanded} as compared to that in conventional far-field PLS systems, due to the energy-spread effect in the mixed-field scenario. Then, we further extend the analysis to a two-Bob-one-Eve system. It is revealed that as compared to the one-Bob system, the interferences from the other Bob can be effectively used to weaken the capability of Eve for intercepting signals of target Bobs, thus leading to enhanced secrecy rates. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to the formulated non-convex problem by leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a higher sum-secrecy-rate than the benchmark scheme where the power allocation is designed based on the (simplified) far-field channel model.

Title: Make Both Ends Meet: A Synergistic Optimization Infrared Small Target Detection with Streamlined Computational Overhead
Authors: Yuxin Jing, Yuchen Zheng, Jufeng Zhao, Guangmang Cui, Tianpei Zhang
Abstract: Infrared small target detection(IRSTD) is widely recognized as a challenging task due to the inherent limitations of infrared imaging, including low signal-to-noise ratios, lack of texture details, and complex background interference. While most existing methods model IRSTD as a semantic segmentation task, but they suffer from two critical drawbacks: (1)blurred target boundaries caused by long-distance imaging dispersion; and (2) excessive computational overhead due to indiscriminate feature stackin. To address these issues, we propose the Lightweight Efficiency Infrared Small Target Detection (LE-IRSTD), a lightweight and efficient framework based on YOLOv8n, with following key innovations. Firstly, we identify that the multiple bottleneck structures within the C2f component of the YOLOv8-n backbone contribute to an increased computational burden. Therefore, we implement the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution block (MBConvblock) and Bottleneck Structure block (BSblock) in the backbone, effectively balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and the extraction of deep semantic information. Secondly, we introduce the Attention-based Variable Convolution Stem (AVCStem) structure, substituting the final convolution with Variable Kernel Convolution (VKConv), which allows for adaptive convolutional kernels that can transform into various shapes, facilitating the receptive field for the extraction of targets. Finally, we employ Global Shuffle Convolution (GSConv) to shuffle the channel dimension features obtained from different convolutional approaches, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our LE-IRSTD method achieves compelling results in both accuracy and lightweight performance, outperforming several state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

Title: AI-Driven Segmentation and Analysis of Microbial Cells
Authors: Shuang Zhang, Carleton Coffin, Karyn L. Rogers, Catherine Ann Royer, Ge Wang
Abstract: Studying the growth and metabolism of microbes provides critical insights into their evolutionary adaptations to harsh environments, which are essential for microbial research and biotechnology applications. In this study, we developed an AI-driven image analysis system to efficiently segment individual cells and quantitatively analyze key cellular features. This system is comprised of four main modules. First, a denoising algorithm enhances contrast and suppresses noise while preserving fine cellular details. Second, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables accurate, zero-shot segmentation of cells without additional training. Third, post-processing is applied to refine segmentation results by removing over-segmented masks. Finally, quantitative analysis algorithms extract essential cellular features, including average intensity, length, width, and volume. The results show that denoising and post-processing significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of SAM in this new domain. Without human annotations, the AI-driven pipeline automatically and efficiently outlines cellular boundaries, indexes them, and calculates key cellular parameters with high accuracy. This framework will enable efficient and automated quantitative analysis of high-resolution fluorescence microscopy images to advance research into microbial adaptations to grow and metabolism that allow extremophiles to thrive in their harsh habitats.

Title: Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise
Authors: Huiyue Yi, Wuxiong Zhang, Hui Xu
Abstract: The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized in various scientific fields, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In the presence of colored noise, the multivariate regression (MV-R) algorithm models the source detection as a multivariate regression problem and infers the model order from the covariance matrix of the residual error. However, the MV-R algorithm requires that the noise is sufficiently weaker than the signal. In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel signal number estimation algorithm in the presence of colored noise based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Moreover, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria, the MV-R estimator and the RMT estimator to sequentially determine whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from noise. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance than the existing methods.

Title: Improving Audio-Text Retrieval via Hierarchical Cross-Modal Interaction and Auxiliary Captions
Authors: Yifei Xin, Yuexian Zou
Abstract: Most existing audio-text retrieval (ATR) methods focus on constructing contrastive pairs between whole audio clips and complete caption sentences, while ignoring fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g., short segments and phrases or frames and words. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-modal interaction (HCI) method for ATR by simultaneously exploring clip-sentence, segment-phrase, and frame-word relationships, achieving a comprehensive multi-modal semantic comparison. Besides, we also present a novel ATR framework that leverages auxiliary captions (AC) generated by a pretrained captioner to perform feature interaction between audio and generated captions, which yields enhanced audio representations and is complementary to the original ATR matching branch. The audio and generated captions can also form new audio-text pairs as data augmentation for training. Experiments show that our HCI significantly improves the ATR performance. Moreover, our AC framework also shows stable performance gains on multiple datasets.

Title: Bandwidth Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks: A Peer-to-Peer ACIDE Solution
Authors: Andrei Negulescu, Weijia Shang
Abstract: In mobile wireless networks, livestreaming in high user density areas presents two typical challenges: the wireless bandwidth is depleted and the number of users is limited. In this study, a media distribution model utilizing peer to peer communications, Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment, is proposed for bandwidth efficient livestreaming. The basic idea is to group users with identical livestream interest in a cluster of n peers. Instead of sending n copies of a livestream package, only one copy is sent to the cluster. A package is divided into n blocks. Each user receives one block from the base station and the remaining n-1 blocks from the other peers. Two optimization problems are addressed. The first problem is minimizing the bandwidth needed to guarantee a continuous live media play on all peers. A solution is proposed to find the optimal block sizes such that the wireless bandwidth is minimized. The second problem is maximizing the number of peers admitted to a cluster, given a fixed wireless bandwidth. This problem is NP-complete and a greedy strategy is proposed to calculate a feasible solution for peer selection. The proposed model improves the bandwidth efficiency and allows more users to be served.

Title: GenAINet: Enabling Wireless Collective Intelligence via Knowledge Transfer and Reasoning
Authors: Hang Zou, Qiyang Zhao, Samson Lasaulce, Lina Bariah, Mehdi Bennis, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and communication networks are expected to have groundbreaking synergies for 6G. Connecting GenAI agents via a wireless network can potentially unleash the power of Collective Intelligence (CI) and pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current wireless networks are designed as a "data pipe" and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.

Title: Time-Constrained Erasure Correction for Data Recovery in UAV-LoRa-WuR Networks
Authors: Kushwanth Sistu, Siddhartha S. Borkotoky
Abstract: We described two erasure-correction schemes for data recovery in UAV-LoRa-WuR networks. Our results show that unless the maximum number for redundant frames a sensor can send per data-collection cycle is very small, erasure coding provides noticeable improvements over an uncoded transmissions. Whether to employ coding -- and if so, which type -- should be determined based on the sensors' energy budget (which dictates the maximum redundancy), the UAV's hovering time, and the node density. The analytical framework presented above aids in this decision making.

Title: Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain
Authors: Benjamin Ellenberger, Paul Haider, Jakob Jordan, Kevin Max, Ismael Jaras, Laura Kriener, Federico Benitez, Mihai A. Petrovici
Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

Title: AFDM Channel Estimation in Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channels
Authors: Rongyou Cao, Yuheng Zhong, Jiangbin Lyu, Deqing Wang, Liqun Fu
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is a brand new chirp-based multi-carrier (MC) waveform for high mobility communications, with promising advantages over Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other MC waveforms. Existing AFDM research focuses on wireless communication at high carrier frequency (CF), which typically considers only Doppler frequency shift (DFS) as a result of mobility, while ignoring the accompanied Doppler time scaling (DTS) on waveform. However, for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication at much lower CF and propagating at speed of sound, the DTS effect could not be ignored and poses significant challenges for channel estimation. This paper analyzes the channel frequency response (CFR) of AFDM under multi-scale multi-lag (MSML) channels, where each propagating path could have different delay and DFS/DTS. Based on the newly derived input-output formula and its characteristics, two new channel estimation methods are proposed, i.e., AFDM with iterative multi-index (AFDM-IMI) estimation under low to moderate DTS, and AFDM with orthogonal matching pursuit (AFDM-OMP) estimation under high DTS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods against the original AFDM channel estimation method. Moreover, the resulted AFDM system outperforms OFDM as well as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) in terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER), which is consistent with our theoretical analysis based on CFR overlap probability (COP), mutual incoherent property (MIP) and channel diversity gain under MSML channels.

Title: Deep Implicit Optimization enables Robust Learnable Features for Deformable Image Registration
Authors: Rohit Jena, Pratik Chaudhari, James C. Gee
Abstract: Deep Learning in Image Registration (DLIR) methods have been tremendously successful in image registration due to their speed and ability to incorporate weak label supervision at training time. However, existing DLIR methods forego many of the benefits and invariances of optimization methods. The lack of a task-specific inductive bias in DLIR methods leads to suboptimal performance, especially in the presence of domain shift. Our method aims to bridge this gap between statistical learning and optimization by explicitly incorporating optimization as a layer in a deep network. A deep network is trained to predict multi-scale dense feature images that are registered using a black box iterative optimization solver. This optimal warp is then used to minimize image and label alignment errors. By implicitly differentiating end-to-end through an iterative optimization solver, we explicitly exploit invariances of the correspondence matching problem induced by the optimization, while learning registration and label-aware features, and guaranteeing the warp functions to be a local minima of the registration objective in the feature space. Our framework shows excellent performance on in-domain datasets, and is agnostic to domain shift such as anisotropy and varying intensity profiles. For the first time, our method allows switching between arbitrary transformation representations (free-form to diffeomorphic) at test time with zero retraining. End-to-end feature learning also facilitates interpretability of features and arbitrary test-time regularization, which is not possible with existing DLIR methods.

We provide a detailed analysis of the main principles and techniques used, together with the advantages and potential challenges associated with these techniques. Furthermore, the survey focuses on the techniques for defect detection in composite materials, which are important types of materials enjoying increasingly wide application in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, and renewable energy.

Title: Audio-text Retrieval with Transformer-based Hierarchical Alignment and Disentangled Cross-modal Representation
Authors: Yifei Xin, Zhihong Zhu, Xuxin Cheng, Xusheng Yang, Yuexian Zou
Abstract: Most existing audio-text retrieval (ATR) approaches typically rely on a single-level interaction to associate audio and text, limiting their ability to align different modalities and leading to suboptimal matches. In this work, we present a novel ATR framework that leverages two-stream Transformers in conjunction with a Hierarchical Alignment (THA) module to identify multi-level correspondences of different Transformer blocks between audio and text. Moreover, current ATR methods mainly focus on learning a global-level representation, missing out on intricate details to capture audio occurrences that correspond to textual semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Disentangled Cross-modal Representation (DCR) approach that disentangles high-dimensional features into compact latent factors to grasp fine-grained audio-text semantic correlations. Additionally, we develop a confidence-aware (CA) module to estimate the confidence of each latent factor pair and adaptively aggregate cross-modal latent factors to achieve local semantic alignment. Experiments show that our THA effectively boosts ATR performance, with the DCR approach further contributing to consistent performance gains.

Title: Underwater Image Enhancement via Dehazing and Color Restoration
Authors: Chengqin Wu, Shuai Yu, Tuyan Luo, Qiuhua Rao, Qingson Hu, Jingxiang Xu, Lijun Zhang
Abstract: Underwater visual imaging is crucial for marine engineering, but it suffers from low contrast, blurriness, and color degradation, which hinders downstream analysis. Existing underwater image enhancement methods often treat the haze and color cast as a unified degradation process, neglecting their inherent independence while overlooking their synergistic relationship. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based network (referred to as WaterFormer) to improve underwater image quality. WaterFormer contains three major components: a dehazing block (DehazeFormer Block) to capture the self-correlated haze features and extract deep-level features, a Color Restoration Block (CRB) to capture self-correlated color cast features, and a Channel Fusion Block (CFB) that dynamically integrates these decoupled features to achieve comprehensive enhancement. To ensure authenticity, a soft reconstruction layer based on the underwater imaging physics model is included. Further, a Chromatic Consistency Loss and Sobel Color Loss are designed to respectively preserve color fidelity and enhance structural details during network training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that WaterFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in enhancing underwater images.

Title: Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling
Authors: Lukas Schynol, Marius Pesavento
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.

Title: Freezing of Gait Detection Using Gramian Angular Fields and Federated Learning from Wearable Sensors
Authors: Shovito Barua Soumma, S M Raihanul Alam, Rudmila Rahman, Umme Niraj Mahi, Abdullah Mamun, Sayyed Mostafa Mostafavi, Hassan Ghasemzadeh
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease that impairs mobility and safety by increasing the risk of falls. An effective FOG detection system must be accurate, real-time, and deployable in free-living environments to enable timely interventions. However, existing detection methods face challenges due to (1) intra- and inter-patient variability, (2) subject-specific training, (3) using multiple sensors in FOG dominant locations (e.g., ankles) leading to high failure points, (4) centralized, non-adaptive learning frameworks that sacrifice patient privacy and prevent collaborative model refinement across populations and disease progression, and (5) most systems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world applicability for continuous in-home monitoring. Addressing these gaps, we present FOGSense, a real-world deployable FOG detection system designed for uncontrolled, free-living conditions using only a single sensor. FOGSense uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and privacy-preserving federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods with a low false positive rate. We evaluated our system using a public Parkinson's dataset collected in a free-living environment. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieved a 22.2% improvement in F1-score and a 74.53% reduction in false positive rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection.

Title: AoI in Context-Aware Hybrid Radio-Optical IoT Networks
Authors: Aymen Hamrouni, Sofie Pollin, Hazem Sallouha
Abstract: With the surge in IoT devices ranging from wearables to smart homes, prompt transmission is crucial. The Age of Information (AoI) emerges as a critical metric in this context, representing the freshness of the information transmitted across the network. This paper studies hybrid IoT networks that employ Optical Communication (OC) as a reinforcement medium to Radio Frequency (RF). We formulate a non-linear convex optimization that adopts a multi-objective optimization strategy to dynamically schedule the communication between devices and select their corresponding communication technology, aiming to balance the maximization of network throughput with the minimization of energy usage and the frequency of switching between technologies. To mitigate the impact of dominant sub-objectives and their scale disparity, the designed approach employs a regularization method that approximates adequate sub-objective scaling weights. Simulation results show that the OC supplementary integration alongside RF enhances the network's overall performances and significantly reduces the Mean AoI and Peak AoI, allowing the collection of the freshest possible data using the best available communication technology.

Title: FolAI: Synchronized Foley Sound Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment
Authors: Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni, Christian Marinoni, Emilian Postolache, Marco Comunità, Luca Cosmo, Joshua D. Reiss, Danilo Comminiello
Abstract: Traditional sound design workflows rely on manual alignment of audio events to visual cues, as in Foley sound design, where everyday actions like footsteps or object interactions are recreated to match the on-screen motion. This process is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that preserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio generation, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound effects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and the what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the semantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a smooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and rhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In the second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects conditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic embeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content (e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control over both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving creative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual contexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization, demonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned with visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually realistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable and modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in professional and interactive settings.

Title: Private Information Retrieval on Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage
Authors: Shreya Meel, Xiangliang Kong, Thomas Jacob Maranzatto, Itzhak Tamo, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.

Title: VANPY: Voice Analysis Framework
Authors: Gregory Koushnir, Michael Fire, Galit Fuhrmann Alpert, Dima Kagan
Abstract: Voice data is increasingly being used in modern digital communications, yet there is still a lack of comprehensive tools for automated voice analysis and characterization. To this end, we developed the VANPY (Voice Analysis in Python) framework for automated pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification of voice data. The VANPY is an open-source end-to-end comprehensive framework that was developed for the purpose of speaker characterization from voice data. The framework is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of new components and adaptation to various voice analysis applications. It currently incorporates over fifteen voice analysis components - including music/speech separation, voice activity detection, speaker embedding, vocal feature extraction, and various classification models. Four of the VANPY's components were developed in-house and integrated into the framework to extend its speaker characterization capabilities: gender classification, emotion classification, age regression, and height regression. The models demonstrate robust performance across various datasets, although not surpassing state-of-the-art performance. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the framework's ability to extract speaker characteristics on a use-case challenge of analyzing character voices from the movie "Pulp Fiction." The results illustrate the framework's capability to extract multiple speaker characteristics, including gender, age, height, emotion type, and emotion intensity measured across three dimensions: arousal, dominance, and valence.

Title: Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?
Authors: Jiayi Yao, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.

Title: An Analysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Jannis O. Luebsen, Annika Eichler
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of additional information sources into a Bayesian optimization framework while ensuring that safety constraints are satisfied. The interdependencies between these information sources are modeled using an unknown correlation matrix. We explore how uniform error bounds must be adjusted to maintain constraint satisfaction throughout the optimization process, considering both Bayesian and frequentist statistical perspectives. This is achieved by appropriately scaling the error bounds based on a confidence interval that can be estimated from the data. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark functions and a controller parameter optimization problem. Our results highlight a significant improvement in sample efficiency, demonstrating the methods suitability for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.

Title: In vivo validation of Wireless Power Transfer System for Magnetically Controlled Robotic Capsule Endoscopy
Authors: Alessandro Catania, Michele Bertozzi, Nikita J. Greenidge, Benjamin Calme, Gabriele Bandini, Christian Sbrana, Roberto Cecchi, Alice Buffi, Massimo Macucci, Sebastiano Strangio, Pietro Valdastri, Giuseppe Iannaccone
Abstract: This paper presents the in vivo validation of an inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system integrated for the first time into a magnetically controlled robotic capsule endoscopy platform. The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.

Title: Safe Flow Matching: Robot Motion Planning with Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Xiaobing Dai, Zewen Yang, Dian Yu, Shanshan Zhang, Hamid Sadeghian, Sami Haddadin, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow matching (FM)-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with new environments with constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose Safe Flow Matching (SafeFlow), a motion planning framework, for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. SafeFlow leverages our proposed flow matching barrier functions (FMBF) to ensure the planned trajectories remain within safe regions across the entire planning horizon. Crucially, our approach enables training-free, real-time safety enforcement at test time, eliminating the need for retraining. We evaluate SafeFlow on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

Title: Mind2Matter: Creating 3D Models from EEG Signals
Authors: Xia Deng, Shen Chen, Jiale Zhou, Lei Li
Abstract: The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.

Title: Dysarthria Normalization via Local Lie Group Transformations for Robust ASR
Authors: Mikhail Osipov
Abstract: We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech by modeling time, frequency, and amplitude distortions as smooth, local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Scalar fields generate these deformations via exponential maps, and a neural network is trained - using only synthetically warped healthy speech - to infer the fields and apply an approximate inverse at test time. We introduce a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) potential that encourages the model to discover non-trivial field configurations. On real pathological speech, the system delivers consistent gains: up to 17 percentage-point WER reduction on challenging TORGO utterances and a 16 percent drop in WER variance, with no degradation on clean CommonVoice data. Character and phoneme error rates improve in parallel, confirming linguistic relevance. Our results demonstrate that geometrically structured warping provides consistent, zero-shot robustness gains for dysarthric ASR.

Title: Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity
Authors: Andrew Gracyk
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.

Title: SA-MIMO: Scalable Quantum-Based Wireless Communications
Authors: Jiuyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless communication.

Title: CarbonCall: Sustainability-Aware Function Calling for Large Language Models on Edge Devices
Authors: Varatheepan Paramanayakam, Andreas Karatzas, Iraklis Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios Stamoulis
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable real-time function calling in edge AI systems but introduce significant computational overhead, leading to high power consumption and carbon emissions. Existing methods optimize for performance while neglecting sustainability, making them inefficient for energy-constrained environments. We introduce CarbonCall, a sustainability-aware function-calling framework that integrates dynamic tool selection, carbon-aware execution, and quantized LLM adaptation. CarbonCall adjusts power thresholds based on real-time carbon intensity forecasts and switches between model variants to sustain high tokens-per-second throughput under power constraints. Experiments on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that CarbonCall reduces carbon emissions by up to 52%, power consumption by 30%, and execution time by 30%, while maintaining high efficiency.

Title: Pretraining Large Brain Language Model for Active BCI: Silent Speech
Authors: Jinzhao Zhou, Zehong Cao, Yiqun Duan, Connor Barkley, Daniel Leong, Xiaowei Jiang, Quoc-Toan Nguyen, Ziyi Zhao, Thomas Do, Yu-Cheng Chang, Sheng-Fu Liang, Chin-teng Lin
Abstract: This paper explores silent speech decoding in active brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which offer more natural and flexible communication than traditional BCI applications. We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Our research advances silent speech decoding in active BCI systems, offering an innovative solution for EEG language model pretraining and a new dataset for fundamental research.

Title: Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models
Authors: Shunpu Tang, Yuanyuan Jia, Qianqian Yang, Ruichen Zhang, Jihong Park, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.
