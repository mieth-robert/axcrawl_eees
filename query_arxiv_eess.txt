Title: Signal Timing Optimization for Mixed Connected Automated Traffic Based on A Markov Delay Approximation
Authors: Ximin Yue, Yunlong Zhang, Zihao Li, Yang Zhou
Abstract: Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer unparalleled opportunities to revolutionize existing transportation systems. In the near future, CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) are expected to coexist, forming a mixed traffic system. Although several prototype traffic signal systems leveraging CAVs have been developed, a simple yet realistic approximation of mixed traffic delay and optimal signal timing at intersections remains elusive. This paper presents an analytical approximation for delay and optimal cycle length at an isolated intersection of mixed traffic using a stochastic framework that combines Markov chain analysis, a car following model, and queuing theory. Given the intricate nature of mixed traffic delay, the proposed framework systematically incorporates the impacts of multiple factors, such as the distinct arrival and departure behaviors and headway characteristics of CAVs and HDVs, through mathematical derivations to ensure both realism and analytical tractability. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for intersection delay and optimal cycle length are derived. Numerical experiments are then conducted to validate the model and provide insights into the dynamics of mixed traffic delays at signalized intersections.

Title: Optimizing Energy Consumption in Stochastic Production Systems: Using a Simulation-Based Approach for Stopping Policy
Authors: Balwin Bokor, Klaus Altendorfer, Andrea Matta
Abstract: In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing, this study introduces a Simulation-Based Approach (SBA) to model a stopping policy for energy-intensive stochastic production systems, developed and tested in a real-world industrial context. The case company - an energy-intensive lead-acid battery manufacturer - faces significant process uncertainty in its heat-treatment operations, making static planning inefficient. To evaluate a potential sensor-based solution, the SBA leverages simulated sensor data (using a Markovian model) to iteratively refine Bayesian energy estimates and dynamically adjust batch-specific processing times. A full-factorial numerical simulation, mirroring the company's 2024 heat-treatment process, evaluates the SBA's energy reduction potential, configuration robustness, and sensitivity to process uncertainty and sensor distortion. Results are benchmarked against three planning scenarios: (1) Optimized Planned Processing Times (OPT); (2) the company's Current Baseline Practice; and (3) an Ideal Scenario with perfectly known energy requirements. SBA significantly outperforms OPT across all tested environments and in some cases even performs statistically equivalent to an Ideal Scenario. Compared to the Current Baseline Practice, energy input is reduced by 14-25%, depending on uncertainty and sensor accuracy. A Pareto analysis further highlights SBA's ability to balance energy and inspection-labour costs, offering actionable insights for industrial decision-makers.

Title: Stability Analysis of Soft Sensor-Based Control Systems--A Luré-Postnikov Approach Using a Novel Gated Recurrent Neural Network
Authors: Eric Hilgert, Andreas Schwung
Abstract: This article addresses certification of closed-loop stability when a soft-sensor based on a gated recurrent neural network operates in the feedback path of a nonlinear control system. The Hadamard gating used in standard GRU/LSTM cells is shown to violate the Luré-Postnikov Lyapunov conditions of absolute-stability theory, leading to conservative analysis. To overcome this limitation, a modified architecture--termed the Luré-Postnikov gated recurrent neural network (LP-GRNN)--is proposed; its affine update law is compatible with the Luré-Postnikov framework while matching the prediction accuracy of vanilla GRU/LSTM models on the NASA CMAPSS benchmark. Embedding the LP-GRNN, the plant, and a saturated PI controller in a unified standard nonlinear operator form (SNOF) reduces the stability problem to a compact set of tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose feasibility certifies global asymptotic stability. A linearized boiler case study illustrates the workflow and validates the closed-loop performance, thereby bridging modern soft-sensor design with formal stability guarantees.

Title: Control Invariant Sets for Neural Network Dynamical Systems and Recursive Feasibility in Model Predictive Control
Authors: Xiao Li, Tianhao Wei, Changliu Liu, Anouck Girard, Ilya Kolmanovsky
Abstract: Neural networks are powerful tools for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, enhancing predictive capability for control applications. However, their inherent nonlinearity and black-box nature challenge control designs that prioritize rigorous safety and recursive feasibility guarantees. This paper presents algorithmic methods for synthesizing control invariant sets specifically tailored to neural network based dynamical models. These algorithms employ set recursion, ensuring termination after a finite number of iterations and generating subsets in which closed-loop dynamics are forward invariant, thus guaranteeing perpetual operational safety. Additionally, we propose model predictive control designs that integrate these control invariant sets into mixed-integer optimization, with guaranteed adherence to safety constraints and recursive feasibility at the computational level. We also present a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the properties and guarantees of the proposed methods. Numerical simulations in an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the methods' effectiveness in synthesizing control-invariant sets offline and implementing model predictive control online, ensuring safety and recursive feasibility.

Title: Data-based control of Logical Networks
Authors: Giorgia Disarò, Maria Elena Valcher
Abstract: In recent years, data-driven approaches have become increasingly pervasive across all areas of control engineering. However, the applications of data-based techniques to Boolean Control Networks (BCNs) are still very limited. In this paper we aim to fill this gap, by exploring the possibility of solving three fundamental control problems, i.e., state feedback stabilization, safe control and output regulation, for a BCN, leveraging only a limited amount of data generated by the network, without knowing or identifying its model.

Title: Joint Precoding and Probabilistic Constellation Shaping using Arithmetic Distribution Matching
Authors: Babaee Ramin, Oveis Gharan Shahab, Bouchard Martin
Abstract: The problem of joint shaping and precoding is studied in this paper. We introduce statistical dependencies among consecutive symbols to shape the constellation while minimizing the total transmit power when the signal goes through the precoding filter. We propose a stationary Markovian model for optimizing the transition probability of transmit symbols to avoid high-energy sequences when convolved with the precoding filter. A new algorithm based on arithmetic coding is proposed to generate a shaped sequence of symbols with the given Markov model transition probabilities.

Title: MedVKAN: Efficient Feature Extraction with Mamba and KAN for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Hancan Zhu, Jinhao Chen, Guanghua He
Abstract: Medical image segmentation relies heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. However, CNNs are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers suffer from scalability challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, recent advances have explored alternative architectures. The state-space model Mamba offers near-linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies, and the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhances nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Building on these strengths, we propose MedVKAN, an efficient feature extraction model integrating Mamba and KAN. Specifically, we introduce the EFC-KAN module, which enhances KAN with convolutional operations to improve local pixel interaction. We further design the VKAN module, integrating Mamba with EFC-KAN as a replacement for Transformer modules, significantly improving feature extraction. Extensive experiments on five public medical image segmentation datasets show that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one. These results validate the potential of Mamba and KAN for medical image segmentation while introducing an innovative and computationally efficient feature extraction framework.

Title: AnalyticKWS: Towards Exemplar-Free Analytic Class Incremental Learning for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting
Authors: Yang Xiao, Tianyi Peng, Rohan Kumar Das, Yuchen Hu, Huiping Zhuang
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) offers a vital mechanism to identify spoken commands in voice-enabled systems, where user demands often shift, requiring models to learn new keywords continually over time. However, a major problem is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective, these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.

Title: Patient-Specific Autoregressive Models for Organ Motion Prediction in Radiotherapy
Authors: Yuxiang Lai, Jike Zhong, Vanessa Su, Xiaofeng Yang
Abstract: Radiotherapy often involves a prolonged treatment period. During this time, patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion this http URL this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.

Title: S-Crescendo: A Nested Transformer Weaving Framework for Scalable Nonlinear System in S-Domain Representation
Authors: Junlang Huang, Hao Chen, Li Luo, Yong Cai, Lexin Zhang, Tianhao Ma, Yitian Zhang, Zhong Guan
Abstract: Simulation of high-order nonlinear system requires extensive computational resources, especially in modern VLSI backend design where bifurcation-induced instability and chaos-like transient behaviors pose challenges. We present S-Crescendo - a nested transformer weaving framework that synergizes S-domain with neural operators for scalable time-domain prediction in high-order nonlinear networks, alleviating the computational bottlenecks of conventional solvers via Newton-Raphson method. By leveraging the partial-fraction decomposition of an n-th order transfer function into first-order modal terms with repeated poles and residues, our method bypasses the conventional Jacobian matrix-based iterations and efficiently reduces computational complexity from cubic $O(n^3)$ to linear $O(n)$.The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates an S-domain encoder with an attention-based correction operator to simultaneously isolate dominant response and adaptively capture higher-order non-linearities. Validated on order-1 to order-10 networks, our method achieves up to 0.99 test-set ($R^2$) accuracy against HSPICE golden waveforms and accelerates simulation by up to 18(X), providing a scalable, physics-aware framework for high-dimensional nonlinear modeling.

Title: Model-free Dynamic Mode Adaptive Control using Matrix RLS
Authors: Parham Oveissi, Ankit Goel
Abstract: This paper presents a novel, model-free, data-driven control synthesis technique known as dynamic mode adaptive control (DMAC) for synthesizing controllers for complex systems whose mathematical models are not suitable for classical control design. DMAC consists of a dynamics approximation module and a controller module. The dynamics approximation module is motivated by data-driven reduced-order modeling techniques and directly approximates the system's dynamics in state-space form using a matrix version of the recursive least squares algorithm. The controller module includes an output tracking controller that utilizes sparse measurements from the system to generate the control signal. The DMAC controller design technique is demonstrated through various dynamic systems commonly found in engineering applications. A systematic sensitivity study demonstrates the robustness of DMAC with respect to its own hyperparameters and the system's parameters.

Title: Measurement Score-Based Diffusion Model
Authors: Chicago Y. Park, Shirin Shoushtari, Hongyu An, Ulugbek S. Kamilov
Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used in applications ranging from image generation to inverse problems. However, training diffusion models typically requires clean ground-truth images, which are unavailable in many applications. We introduce the Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (MSM), a novel framework that learns partial measurement scores using only noisy and subsampled measurements. MSM models the distribution of full measurements as an expectation over partial scores induced by randomized subsampling. To make the MSM representation computationally efficient, we also develop a stochastic sampling algorithm that generates full images by using a randomly selected subset of partial scores at each step. We additionally propose a new posterior sampling method for solving inverse problems that reconstructs images using these partial scores. We provide a theoretical analysis that bounds the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by full and stochastic sampling, establishing the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MSM on natural images and multi-coil MRI, showing that it can generate high-quality images and solve inverse problems -- all without access to clean training data.

Title: Exploring the Potential of SSL Models for Sound Event Detection
Authors: Hanfang Cui, Longfei Song, Li Li, Dongxing Xu, Yanhua Long
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT, WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration, dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific fusion and robust SED system design.

Title: Bridging the Inter-Domain Gap through Low-Level Features for Cross-Modal Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Pengfei Lyu, Pak-Hei Yeung, Xiaosheng Yu, Jing Xia, Jianning Chi, Chengdong Wu, Jagath C. Rajapakse
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of cross-modal medical image segmentation by exploring unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches. We propose a model-agnostic UDA framework, LowBridge, which builds on a simple observation that cross-modal images share some similar low-level features (e.g., edges) as they are depicting the same structures. Specifically, we first train a generative model to recover the source images from their edge features, followed by training a segmentation model on the generated source images, separately. At test time, edge features from the target images are input to the pretrained generative model to generate source-style target domain images, which are then segmented using the pretrained segmentation network. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets demonstrate that \proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming eleven existing UDA approaches under different settings. Notably, further ablation studies show that \proposed is agnostic to different types of generative and segmentation models, suggesting its potential to be seamlessly plugged with the most advanced models to achieve even more outstanding results in the future.

Title: Joint Manifold Learning and Optimal Transport for Dynamic Imaging
Authors: Sven Dummer, Puru Vaish, Christoph Brune
Abstract: Dynamic imaging is critical for understanding and visualizing dynamic biological processes in medicine and cell biology. These applications often encounter the challenge of a limited amount of time series data and time points, which hinders learning meaningful patterns. Regularization methods provide valuable prior knowledge to address this challenge, enabling the extraction of relevant information despite the scarcity of time-series data and time points. In particular, low-dimensionality assumptions on the image manifold address sample scarcity, while time progression models, such as optimal transport (OT), provide priors on image development to mitigate the lack of time points. Existing approaches using low-dimensionality assumptions disregard a temporal prior but leverage information from multiple time series. OT-prior methods, however, incorporate the temporal prior but regularize only individual time series, ignoring information from other time series of the same image modality. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating a low-dimensionality assumption of the underlying image manifold with an OT regularizer for time-evolving images. In particular, we propose a latent model representation of the underlying image manifold and promote consistency between this representation, the time series data, and the OT prior on the time-evolving images. We discuss the advantages of enriching OT interpolations with latent models and integrating OT priors into latent models.

Title: BINAQUAL: A Full-Reference Objective Localization Similarity Metric for Binaural Audio
Authors: Davoud Shariat Panah, Dan Barry, Alessandro Ragano, Jan Skoglund, Andrew Hines
Abstract: Spatial audio enhances immersion in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, and cinema by creating a three-dimensional auditory experience. Ensuring the spatial fidelity of binaural audio is crucial, given that processes such as compression, encoding, or transmission can alter localization cues. While subjective listening tests like MUSHRA remain the gold standard for evaluating spatial localization quality, they are costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces BINAQUAL, a full-reference objective metric designed to assess localization similarity in binaural audio recordings. BINAQUAL adapts the AMBIQUAL metric, originally developed for localization quality assessment in ambisonics audio format to the binaural domain. We evaluate BINAQUAL across five key research questions, examining its sensitivity to variations in sound source locations, angle interpolations, surround speaker layouts, audio degradations, and content diversity. Results demonstrate that BINAQUAL effectively differentiates between subtle spatial variations and correlates strongly with subjective listening tests, making it a reliable metric for binaural localization quality assessment. The proposed metric provides a robust benchmark for ensuring spatial accuracy in binaural audio processing, paving the way for improved objective evaluations in immersive audio applications.

Title: Fine-Grained ECG-Text Contrastive Learning via Waveform Understanding Enhancement
Authors: Haitao Li, Che Liu, Zhengyao Ding, Ziyi Liu, Zhengxing Huang
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. While previous ECG-text contrastive learning methods have shown promising results, they often overlook the incompleteness of the reports. Given an ECG, the report is generated by first identifying key waveform features and then inferring the final diagnosis through these features. Despite their importance, these waveform features are often not recorded in the report as intermediate results. Aligning ECGs with such incomplete reports impedes the model's ability to capture the ECG's waveform features and limits its understanding of diagnostic reasoning based on those features. To address this, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which aims to recover these waveform features from incomplete reports with the help of large language models (LLMs), under the challenges of hallucinations and the non-bijective relationship between waveform features and diagnoses. Additionally, considering the frequent false negatives due to the prevalence of common diagnoses in ECGs, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide contrastive learning. Furthermore, we adopt a sigmoid-based loss function to accommodate the multi-label nature of ECG-related tasks. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing across these datasets.

Title: Reach-avoid games for players with damped double integrator dynamics
Authors: Mengxin Lyu, Ruiliang Deng, Zongying Shi, Yisheng Zhong
Abstract: This paper studies a reach-avoid game of two damped double integrator players. An attacker aims to reach a static target, while a faster defender tries to protect the target by intercepting the attacker before it reaches the target. In scenarios where the defender succeeds, the defender aims to maximize the attacker's final distance from the target, while the attacker aims to minimize it. This work focuses on determining the equilibrium strategy in the defender-winning scenarios. The optimal state feedback strategy is obtained by a differential game approach combining geometric analysis. We construct a multiple reachable region to analyse the damped double integrator player's motion under optimal strategy. Building on this, a new type of the attacker's dominance region is introduced for the first time. It is shown that different strategies are required when the terminal point lies in distinct areas of the attacker's dominance region. Then, a necessary condition is derived for the proposed strategy to be optimal using differential game approach. Furthermore, a case where both players start at rest is discussed, and some useful properties about the dominance region and the optimal strategy are presented. Simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Title: Particle Filtering for Enhanced Parameter Estimation in Bilinear Systems Under Colored Noise
Authors: Khalid Abd El Mageed Hag Elamin
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of parameter estimation in bilinear systems under colored noise. A novel approach, termed B-PF-RLS, is proposed, combining a particle filter (PF) with a recursive least squares (RLS) estimator. The B-PF-RLS algorithm tackles the complexities arising from system nonlinearities and colored noise by effectively estimating unknown system states using the particle filter, which are then integrated into the RLS parameter estimation process. Furthermore, the paper introduces an enhanced particle filter that eliminates the need for explicit knowledge of the measurement noise variance, enhancing the method's practicality for real-world applications. Numerical examples demonstrate the B-PF-RLS algorithm's superior performance in accurately estimating both system parameters and states, even under uncertain noise conditions. This work offers a robust and effective solution for system identification in various engineering applications involving bilinear models subject to complex noise environments.

Title: Bayesian Deep Learning Approaches for Uncertainty-Aware Retinal OCT Image Segmentation for Multiple Sclerosis
Authors: Samuel T. M. Ball
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides valuable insights in ophthalmology, cardiology, and neurology due to high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina. One critical task for ophthalmologists using OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is time-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability of diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face challenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of uncertainty estimation, leading to "confidently wrong" models via hallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT imaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian models can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can further be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording artefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also allows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as layer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these features come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over all delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%. Our work brings greater clinical applicability, statistical robustness, and performance to retinal OCT segmentation.

Abstract: This paper reviews the NTIRE 2025 Efficient Burst HDR and Restoration Challenge, which aims to advance efficient multi-frame high dynamic range (HDR) and restoration techniques. The challenge is based on a novel RAW multi-frame fusion dataset, comprising nine noisy and misaligned RAW frames with various exposure levels per scene. Participants were tasked with developing solutions capable of effectively fusing these frames while adhering to strict efficiency constraints: fewer than 30 million model parameters and a computational budget under 4.0 trillion FLOPs. A total of 217 participants registered, with six teams finally submitting valid solutions. The top-performing approach achieved a PSNR of 43.22 dB, showcasing the potential of novel methods in this domain. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge, compares the proposed solutions, and serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in efficient burst HDR and restoration.

Title: HISTAI: An Open-Source, Large-Scale Whole Slide Image Dataset for Computational Pathology
Authors: Dmitry Nechaev, Alexey Pchelnikov, Ekaterina Ivanova
Abstract: Recent advancements in Digital Pathology (DP), particularly through artificial intelligence and Foundation Models, have underscored the importance of large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated datasets. Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions. The dataset can be accessed at this https URL.

Title: Optimal Satellite Maneuvers for Spaceborne Jamming Attacks
Authors: Filippos Fotiadis, Quentin Rommel, Brian M. Sadler, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Satellites are becoming exceedingly critical for communication, making them prime targets for cyber-physical attacks. We consider a rogue satellite in low Earth orbit that jams the uplink communication between another satellite and a ground station. To achieve maximal interference with minimal fuel consumption, the jammer carefully maneuvers itself relative to the target satellite's antenna. We cast this maneuvering objective as a two-stage optimal control problem, involving i) repositioning to an efficient jamming position before uplink communication commences; and ii) maintaining an efficient jamming position after communication has started. We obtain the optimal maneuvering trajectories for the jammer and perform simulations to show how they enable the disruption of uplink communication with reasonable fuel consumption.

Title: WaLRUS: Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs
Authors: Hossein Babaei, Mel White, Sina Alemohammad, Richard G. Baraniuk
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the recent method known as HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite diversity of possible "species" within the SSM family. In this paper, we introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.

Title: OFDM Based Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication: Sensing Beyond CP Limit
Authors: Cuneyd Ozturk, Cagri Goken
Abstract: This work investigates a bistatic OFDM-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under a single-target scenario, considering both line-of-sight (LOS) presence and LOS blockage cases. A sliding window-based sensing receiver architecture is proposed to extend the intersymbol interference (ISI)-free sensing range beyond the cyclic prefix (CP) duration by exploiting pilot symbols embedded in the time-frequency grid. The performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated in terms of range and velocity estimation accuracy and is compared against the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the bi-static ISAC setting. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves estimation performance that closely approaches the CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

Title: UAV-Enabled Joint Sensing, Communication, Powering and Backhaul Transmission in Maritime Monitoring Networks
Authors: Bohan Li, Jiahao Liu, Yujun Liang, Qian Li, Haochen Liu, Yaoyuan Zhang, Junsheng Mu, Shahid Mumtaz, Sheng Chen
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of energy-constrained maritime monitoring networks by proposing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing, communication, powering and backhaul transmission scheme with a tailored time-division duplex frame structure. Within each time slot, the UAV sequentially implements sensing, wireless charging and uplink receiving with buoys, and lastly forwards part of collected data to the central ship via backhaul links. Considering the tight coupling among these functions, we jointly optimize time allocation, UAV trajectory, UAV-buoy association, and power scheduling to maximize the performance of data collection, with the practical consideration of sea clutter effects during UAV sensing. A novel optimization framework combining alternating optimization, quadratic transform and augmented first-order Taylor approximation is developed, which demonstrates good convergence behavior and robustness. Simulation results show that under sensing quality-of-service constraint, buoys are able to achieve an average data rate over 22bps/Hz using around 2mW harvested power per active time slot, validating the scheme's effectiveness for open-sea monitoring. Additionally, it is found that under the influence of sea clutters, the optimal UAV trajectory always keeps a certain distance with buoys to strike a balance between sensing and other multi-functional transmissions.

Title: CTLformer: A Hybrid Denoising Model Combining Convolutional Layers and Self-Attention for Enhanced CT Image Reconstruction
Authors: Zhiting Zheng, Shuqi Wu, Wen Ding
Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) images are often accompanied by significant noise, which negatively impacts image quality and subsequent diagnostic accuracy. To address the challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution patterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model, CTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer architecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention mechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention mechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention interaction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global structures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing noise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention distribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on high-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby enhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore, CTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and uses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further strengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016 National Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset demonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both denoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of LDCT images. The proposed CTLformer not only provides an efficient solution for LDCT denoising but also shows broad potential in medical image analysis, especially for clinical applications dealing with complex noise patterns.

Title: Simultaneously Exposing and Jamming Covert Communications via Disco Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Huan Huang, Hongliang Zhang, Yi Cai, Dusit Niyato, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Zhu Han
Abstract: Covert communications provide a stronger privacy protection than cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS). However, previous works on covert communications have implicitly assumed the validity of channel reciprocity, i.e., wireless channels remain constant or approximately constant during their coherence time. In this work, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco RIS (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, where the DRIS with random and time-varying reflective coefficients acts as a "disco ball", introducing timevarying fully-passive jamming (FPJ). Consequently, the channel reciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities of Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional jamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we first design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of time-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error probabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the signal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob. Based on the detection rule, we derive the detection threshold for the warden Willie to detect whether communications between Alice and Bob is ongoing, considering the time-varying DRIS-based FPJ. Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses of the FAR and the MDR at the warden Willie, as well as SJNR at Bob, and then present unique properties of the DRIS-based FPJ in covert communications. We present numerical results to validate the derived theoretical analyses and evaluate the impact of DRIS on covert communications.

Title: Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Dong Yang, Yiyi Cai, Yuki Saito, Lixu Wang, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: We propose a shallow flow matching (SFM) mechanism to enhance flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments show that SFM consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech in both objective and subjective evaluations, while significantly reducing inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers.

Title: PRETI: Patient-Aware Retinal Foundation Model via Metadata-Guided Representation Learning
Authors: Yeonkyung Lee, Woojung Han, Youngjun Jun, Hyeonmin Kim, Jungkyung Cho, Seong Jae Hwang
Abstract: Retinal foundation models have significantly advanced retinal image analysis by leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled data while achieving strong generalization. Many recent approaches enhance retinal image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs, associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data, indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal disease analysis.

Title: Unified Architecture and Unsupervised Speech Disentanglement for Speaker Embedding-Free Enrollment in Personalized Speech Enhancement
Authors: Ziling Huang, Haixin Guan, Yanhua Long
Abstract: Conventional speech enhancement (SE) aims to improve speech perception and intelligibility by suppressing noise without requiring enrollment speech as reference, whereas personalized SE (PSE) addresses the cocktail party problem by extracting a target speaker's speech using enrollment speech. While these two tasks tackle different yet complementary challenges in speech signal processing, they often share similar model architectures, with PSE incorporating an additional branch to process enrollment speech. This suggests developing a unified model capable of efficiently handling both SE and PSE tasks, thereby simplifying deployment while maintaining high performance. However, PSE performance is sensitive to variations in enrollment speech, like emotional tone, which limits robustness in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose two novel models, USEF-PNet and DSEF-PNet, both extending our previous SEF-PNet framework. USEF-PNet introduces a unified architecture for processing enrollment speech, integrating SE and PSE into a single framework to enhance performance and streamline deployment. Meanwhile, DSEF-PNet incorporates an unsupervised speech disentanglement approach by pairing a mixture speech with two different enrollment utterances and enforcing consistency in the extracted target speech. This strategy effectively isolates high-quality speaker identity information from enrollment speech, reducing interference from factors such as emotion and content, thereby improving PSE robustness. Additionally, we explore a long-short enrollment pairing (LSEP) strategy to examine the impact of enrollment speech duration during both training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on the Libri2Mix and VoiceBank DEMAND demonstrate that our proposed USEF-PNet, DSEF-PNet all achieve substantial performance improvements, with random enrollment duration performing slightly better.

Title: Toward Near-Space Communication Network in the 6G and Beyond Era
Authors: Xinhua Liu, Zhen Gao, Ziwei Wan, Zhonghuai Wu, Tuan Li, Tianqi Mao, Xiao Liang, Dezhi Zheng, Jun Zhang
Abstract: Near-space communication network (NS-ComNet), as an indispensable component of sixth-generation (6G) and beyond mobile communication systems and the space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN), demonstrates unique advantages in wide-area coverage, long-endurance high-altitude operation, and highly flexible deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NS-ComNet for 6G and beyond era. Specifically, by contrasting satellite, low-altitude unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial communications, we first elucidate the background and motivation for integrating NS-ComNet into 6G network architectures. Subsequently, we review the developmental status of near-space platforms, including high-altitude balloons, solar-powered UAVs, and stratospheric airships, and analyze critical challenges faced by NS-ComNet. To address these challenges, the research focuses on key enabling technologies such as topology design, resource and handover management, multi-objective joint optimization, etc., with particular emphasis on artificial intelligence techniques for NS-ComNet. Finally, envisioning future intelligent collaborative networks that integrate NS-ComNet with satellite-UAV-terrestrial systems, we explore promising directions. This paper aims to provide technical insights and research foundations for the systematic construction of NS-ComNet and its deep deployment in the 6G and beyond era.

Title: Impact of Power Fluctuations on Frequency Quality
Authors: Angel Vaca, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper analyzes how power injections affect frequency quality in power systems. We first derive a general expression linking active and reactive power injections at buses to the system's frequency. This formulation explicitly considers both real and imaginary frequency components, providing a complete description of frequency behavior in power systems during transients. Next, we extend our analysis to incorporate stochastic variations of power injections. Using the frequency divider concept and power-based frequency estimation, we develop analytical relationships linking stochastic load fluctuations to frequency deviations. We discuss under which conditions the Central Limit Theorem cannot be applied to capture the frequency distribution, thereby clarifying how its hypotheses are not satisfied in power system applications. Then, we establish clear criteria for the appropriate use of statistical methods in frequency analysis. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through simulations on modified IEEE 14-bus and all-island Irish transmission test systems, highlighting the accuracy, practical utility, and limitations of our proposed formulation.

Title: Data-Efficient Automatic Shaping of Liquid Droplets on an Air-Ferrofluid Interface with Bayesian Optimization
Authors: P. A. Diluka Harischandra, Quan Zhou
Abstract: Manipulating the shape of a liquid droplet is essential for a wide range of applications in medicine and industry. However, existing methods are typically limited to generating simple shapes, such as ellipses, or rely on predefined templates. Although recent approaches have demonstrated more complex geometries, they remain constrained by limited adaptability and lack of real-time control. Here, we introduce a data-efficient method that enables real-time, programmable shaping of nonmagnetic liquid droplets into diverse target forms at the air-ferrofluid interface using Bayesian optimization. The droplet can adopt either convex or concave shapes depending on the actuation of the surrounding electromagnets. Bayesian optimization determines the optimal magnetic flux density for shaping the liquid droplet into a desired target shape. Our method enables automatic shaping into various triangular and rectangular shapes with a maximum shape error of 0.81 mm, as well as into letter-like patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of real-time, automatic shaping of nonmagnetic liquid droplets into desired target shapes using magnetic fields or other external energy fields.

Title: Resolving the Double Near-Far Problem via Wireless Powered Pinching-Antenna Networks
Authors: Vasilis K. Papanikolaou, Gui Zhou, Brikena Kaziu, Ata Khalili, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, George K. Karagiannidis, Robert Schober
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel wireless powered communication system, referred to as a wireless powered pinching-antenna network (WPPAN), utilizing a single waveguide with pinching antennas to address the double near-far problem inherent in wireless powered networks. In the proposed WPPAN, users harvest energy from spatially distributed pinching antennas in the downlink and use the collected power to transmit messages in the uplink. Furthermore, to manage the combinatorial complexity associated with activating the pinching antennas, we propose three approaches of varying complexity to simplify the original resource allocation problem and then solve it efficiently using convex optimization methods. Simulation results confirm that the proposed WPPAN system effectively mitigates the double near-far problem by providing antenna resources closer to the users, thereby enhancing both downlink energy harvesting and uplink data transmission.

Title: Mutual Evidential Deep Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yuanpeng He, Yali Bi, Lijian Li, Chi-Man Pun, Wenpin Jiao, Zhi Jin
Abstract: Existing semi-supervised medical segmentation co-learning frameworks have realized that model performance can be diminished by the biases in model recognition caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Due to the averaging nature of their pseudo-label integration strategy, they fail to explore the reliability of pseudo-labels from different sources. In this paper, we propose a mutual evidential deep learning (MEDL) framework that offers a potentially viable solution for pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning from two perspectives. First, we introduce networks with different architectures to generate complementary evidence for unlabeled samples and adopt an improved class-aware evidential fusion to guide the confident synthesis of evidential predictions sourced from diverse architectural networks. Second, utilizing the uncertainty in the fused evidence, we design an asymptotic Fisher information-based evidential learning strategy. This strategy enables the model to initially focus on unlabeled samples with more reliable pseudo-labels, gradually shifting attention to samples with lower-quality pseudo-labels while avoiding over-penalization of mislabeled classes in high data uncertainty samples. Additionally, for labeled data, we continue to adopt an uncertainty-driven asymptotic learning strategy, gradually guiding the model to focus on challenging voxels. Extensive experiments on five mainstream datasets have demonstrated that MEDL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Time-Continuous Frequency Allocation for Feeder Links of Mega Constellations with Multi-Antenna Gateway Stations
Authors: Zijun Liu, Yafei Wang, Tianhao Fang, Wenjin Wang, Zhili Sun
Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of mega low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, multi-antenna gateway station (MAGS) has emerged as a key enabler to support extremely high system capacity via massive feeder links. However, the densification of both space and ground segment leads to reduced spatial separation between links, posing unprecedented challenges of interference exacerbation. This paper investigates graph coloring-based frequency allocation methods for interference mitigation (IM) of mega LEO systems. We first reveal the characteristics of MAGS interference pattern and formulate the IM problem into a $K$-coloring problem using an adaptive threshold method. Then we propose two tailored graph coloring algorithms, namely Generalized Global (GG) and Clique-Based Tabu Search (CTS), to solve this problem. GG employs a low-complexity greedy conflict avoidance strategy, while CTS leverages the unique clique structure brought by MAGSs to enhance IM performance. Subsequently, we innovatively modify them to achieve time-continuous frequency allocation, which is crucial to ensure the stability of feeder links. Moreover, we further devise two mega constellation decomposition methods to alleviate the complexity burden of satellite operators. Finally, we propose a list coloring-based vacant subchannel utilization method to further improve spectrum efficiency and system capacity. Simulation results on Starlink constellation of the first and second generations with 34396 satellites demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology.

Title: Optimal Task and Motion Planning for Autonomous Systems Using Petri Nets
Authors: Zhou He, Shilong Yuan, Ning Ran, Dimitri Lefebvre
Abstract: This study deals with the problem of task and motion planning of autonomous systems within the context of high-level tasks. Specifically, a task comprises logical requirements (conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations) on the trajectories and final states of agents in certain regions of interest. We propose an optimal planning approach that combines offline computation and online planning. First, a simplified Petri net system is proposed to model the autonomous system. Then, indicating places are designed to implement the logical requirements of the specifications. Building upon this, a compact representation of the state space called extended basis reachability graph is constructed and an efficient online planning algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal plan. It is shown that the most burdensome part of the planning procedure may be removed offline, thanks to the construction of the extended basis reachability graph. Finally, series of simulations are conducted to demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our developed method.

Title: FreqSelect: Frequency-Aware fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction
Authors: Junliang Ye, Lei Wang, Md Zakir Hossain
Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.

Title: Bistatic Sensing in 5G NR
Authors: Rajeev Gangula, Sakthivel Velumani, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: In this work, we propose and evaluate the performance of a 5th generation (5G) New Radio (NR) bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISaC) system. Unlike the full-duplex monostatic ISaC systems, the bistatic approach enables sensing in the current cellular networks without significantly modifying the transceiver design. The sensing utilizes data channels, such as the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), which carries information on the air interface. We provide the maximum likelihood estimator for the delay and Doppler parameters and derive a lower bound on the Mean Square Error (MSE) for a single target scenario. Link-level simulations show that it is possible to achieve significant throughput while accurately estimating the sensing parameters with PUSCH. Moreover, the results reveal an interesting tradeoff between the number of reference symbols, sensing performance, and throughput in the proposed 5G NR bistatic ISaC system.

Title: Acoustic Field Reconstruction in Tubes via Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Xinmeng Luan, Kazuya Yokota, Gary Scavone
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to inverse problems in acoustic tube analysis, focusing on reconstructing acoustic fields from noisy and limited observation data. Specifically, we address scenarios where the radiation model is unknown, and pressure data is only available at the tube's radiation end. A PINNs framework is proposed to reconstruct the acoustic field, along with the PINN Fine-Tuning Method (PINN-FTM) and a traditional optimization method (TOM) for predicting radiation model coefficients. The results demonstrate that PINNs can effectively reconstruct the tube's acoustic field under noisy conditions, even with unknown radiation parameters. PINN-FTM outperforms TOM by delivering balanced and reliable predictions and exhibiting robust noise-tolerance capabilities.

Title: Transmission Neural Networks: Approximation and Optimal Control
Authors: Shuang Gao, Peter E. Caines
Abstract: Transmission Neural Networks (TransNNs) introduced by Gao and Caines (2022) connect virus spread models over networks and neural networks with tuneable activation functions. This paper presents the approximation technique and the underlying assumptions employed by TransNNs in relation to the corresponding Markovian Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with 2^n states, where n is the number of nodes in the network. The underlying infection paths are assumed to be stochastic with heterogeneous and time-varying transmission probabilities. We obtain the conditional probability of infection in the stochastic 2^n-state SIS epidemic model corresponding to each state configuration under mild assumptions, which enables control solutions based on Markov decision processes (MDP). Finally, MDP control with 2^n-state SIS epidemic models and optimal control with TransNNs are compared in terms of mitigating virus spread over networks through vaccination, and it is shown that TranNNs enable the generation of control laws with significant computational savings, albeit with more conservative control actions.

Title: Multi-View Wireless Sensing via Conditional Generative Learning: Framework and Model Design
Authors: Ziqing Xing, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zirui Chen, Hongning Ruan, Zhaohui Yang
Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information (CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme, which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels. Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.

Title: A Control Oriented Fractional-Order Model of Lithium-ion Batteries Based on Caputo Definition
Authors: Yangyang Xu, Hongyu Zhao, Chengzhong Zhang, Chenglin Liao
Abstract: This letter proposes a fractional-order battery model based on the Caputo definition. A closed-form time-domain solution is derived, enabling a simple recursive expression for discrete-time implementation. The model requires only the current and previous time-step states in each iteration, significantly reducing memory usage compared to the conventional Grünwald--Letnikov (G-L) method. This recursive structure is highly compatible with filter design and online parameter identification. Experimental validation on a 40.2~Ah NCM622 cell shows that the proposed first-order model achieves voltage prediction accuracy comparable to a second-order integer-order model. The results demonstrate that the Caputo-based model offers a practical balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well suited for real-time battery management systems (BMS).

Title: Bridging the Modality Gap: Enhancing Channel Prediction with Semantically Aligned LLMs and Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Zhaoyang Li, Qianqian Yang, Zehui Xiong, Zhiguo Shi, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction is essential in massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) systems to improve precoding effectiveness and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, existing methods often suffer from accumulated prediction errors and poor generalization to dynamic wireless environments. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable modeling and generalization capabilities in tasks such as time series prediction, making them a promising solution. Nevertheless, a significant modality gap exists between the linguistic knowledge embedded in pretrained LLMs and the intrinsic characteristics of CSI, posing substantial challenges for their direct application to channel prediction. Moreover, the large parameter size of LLMs hinders their practical deployment in real-world communication systems with stringent latency constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel prediction framework based on semantically aligned large models, referred to as CSI-ALM, which bridges the modality gap between natural language and channel information. Specifically, we design a cross-modal fusion module that aligns CSI representations . Additionally, we maximize the cosine similarity between word embeddings and CSI embeddings to construct semantic cues. To reduce complexity and enable practical implementation, we further introduce a lightweight version of the proposed approach, called CSI-ALM-Light. This variant is derived via a knowledge distillation strategy based on attention matrices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSI-ALM achieves a 1 dB gain over state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, under limited training data conditions, CSI-ALM-Light, with only 0.34M parameters, attains performance comparable to CSI-ALM and significantly outperforms conventional deep learning approaches.

Title: Secrecy Capacity of Hybrid VLC-RF Systems with Light Energy Harvesting
Authors: Tuan A. Hoang, Thanh V. Pham, Chuyen T. Nguyen
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in a multi-user hybrid heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) wireless communication system with simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). In the considered system, VLC is used for downlink (DL) while RF is employed for uplink (UL) transmission. In addition, to support multiple users, time division multiple access (TDMA) is assumed for both DL and UL channels. In the DL, each user receives information during its allocated time slot of the TDMA frame and harvests energy from the received signal outside the time slot. The harvested energy is then used for transmitting the signal over the UL channel, which is subject to eavesdropping by an unauthorized user. Therefore, PLS is employed to protect the confidentiality of the UL information. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to solve the optimal DL and UL time slots that maximize the PLS performance given a target sum rate of the DL. We show that the problem can be cast as a difference of convex functions (DC) program, which can be solved efficiently using the DC algorithm (DCA).

Title: Multi-Reference and Adaptive Nonlinear Transform Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Image Semantic Transmission
Authors: Cheng Yuan, Yufei Jiang, Xu Zhu
Abstract: We propose a multi-reference and adaptive nonlinear transform source-channel coding (MA-NTSCC) system for wireless image semantic transmission to improve rate-distortion (RD) performance by introducing multi-dimensional contexts into the entropy model of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NTSCC system. Improvements in RD performance of the proposed MA-NTSCC system are particularly significant in high-resolution image transmission under low bandwidth constraints. The proposed multi-reference entropy model leverages correlations within the latent representation in both spatial and channel dimensions. In the spatial dimension, the latent representation is divided into anchors and non-anchors in a checkerboard pattern, where anchors serve as reference to estimate the mutual information between anchors and non-anchors. In the channel dimension, the latent representation is partitioned into multiple groups, and features in previous groups are analyzed to estimate the mutual information between features in previous and current groups. Taking mutual information into account, the entropy model provides an accurate estimation on the entropy, which enables efficient bandwidth allocation and enhances RD performance. Additionally, the proposed lightweight adaptation modules enable the proposed MA-NTSCC model to achieve transmission quality comparable to separately trained models across various channel conditions and bandwidth requirements. In contrast, traditional NTSCC models provide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-distortion performance degrading with channel quality deviating from the fixed training SNR, and consume inflexible bandwidth to transmit an image. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance and adaptability of the proposed MA-NTSCC model superior to SOTA methods over both additive white Gaussian noise channel and Rayleigh fading channel.

Authors: Joseph T.A. Peterson, Vishala Arya, John L. Junkins
Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.

Title: The Gaussian Latent Machine: Efficient Prior and Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems
Authors: Muhamed Kuric, Martin Zach, Andreas Habring, Michael Unser, Thomas Pock
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a product-of-experts-type model that encompasses many standard prior and posterior distributions commonly found in Bayesian imaging. We show that this model can be easily lifted into a novel latent variable model, which we refer to as a Gaussian latent machine. This leads to a general sampling approach that unifies and generalizes many existing sampling algorithms in the literature. Most notably, it yields a highly efficient and effective two-block Gibbs sampling approach in the general case, while also specializing to direct sampling algorithms in particular cases. Finally, we present detailed numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed sampling approach across a wide range of prior and posterior sampling problems from Bayesian imaging.

Title: Scheduling of Flexible Manufacturing Systems Based on Place-Timed Petri Nets and Basis Reachability Graphs
Authors: Zhou He, Ning Li, Ning Ran, Liang Li
Abstract: Scheduling is a key decision-making process to improve the performance of flexible manufacturing systems. Place-timed Petri nets provide a formal method for graphically modeling and analyzing such systems. By generating reachability graphs and combining intelligent search algorithms, operation sequences from the initial state to the target state can be found for the underlying system. However, the reachability graph grows exponentially with the system size increases, which is the main challenge of existing methods for scheduling large systems. To this end, we develop an efficient improved beam search algorithm to optimize the makespan based on a compact representation of reachability graph called basis reachability graph. The key idea behind the proposed method is to form a state together with the basis markings and its corresponding transition sequences, and evaluate the cost of the state based on the resource idle time. Experimental results are conducted on several benchmark systems which show that the developed method improves the search efficiency while ensuring the quality of the solution compared with existing methods.

Title: 3D Gaussian Adaptive Reconstruction for Fourier Light-Field Microscopy
Authors: Chenyu Xu, Zhouyu Jin, Chengkang Shen, Hao Zhu, Zhan Ma, Bo Xiong, You Zhou, Xun Cao, Ning Gu
Abstract: Compared to light-field microscopy (LFM), which enables high-speed volumetric imaging but suffers from non-uniform spatial sampling, Fourier light-field microscopy (FLFM) introduces sub-aperture division at the pupil plane, thereby ensuring spatially invariant sampling and enhancing spatial resolution. Conventional FLFM reconstruction methods, such as Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution, exhibit poor axial resolution and signal degradation due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. While data-driven approaches enhance spatial resolution by leveraging high-quality paired datasets or imposing structural priors, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods employ physics-informed self-supervised learning to overcome these limitations, yet they are hindered by substantial computational costs and memory demands. Therefore, we propose 3D Gaussian Adaptive Tomography (3DGAT) for FLFM, a 3D gaussian splatting based self-supervised learning framework that significantly improves the volumetric reconstruction quality of FLFM while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves higher resolution and improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to advance FLFM imaging and broaden its applications in 3D optical microscopy.

Title: RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions
Authors: Junzhi Ning, Cheng Tang, Kaijin Zhou, Diping Song, Lihao Liu, Ming Hu, Wei Li, Yanzhou Su, Tianbing Li, Jiyao Liu, Yejin, Sheng Zhang, Yuanfeng Ji, Junjun He
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. To synthesise Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited, thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.

Title: Power Allocation for Delay Optimization in Device-to-Device Networks: A Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Hao Fang, Kai Huang, Hao Ye, Chongtao Guo, Le Liang, Xiao Li, Shi Jin
Abstract: The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method, where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm. This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits scalability and generalization capability.

Title: 6G-Enabled Smart Railways
Authors: Bo Ai, Yunlong Lu, Yuguang Fang, Dusit Niyato, Ruisi He, Wei Chen, Jiayi Zhang, Guoyu Ma, Yong Niu, Zhangdui Zhong
Abstract: Smart railways integrate advanced information technologies into railway operating systems to improve efficiency and reliability. Although the development of 5G has enhanced railway services, future smart railways require ultra-high speeds, ultra-low latency, ultra-high security, full coverage, and ultra-high positioning accuracy, which 5G cannot fully meet. Therefore, 6G is envisioned to provide green and efficient all-day operations, strong information security, fully automatic driving, and low-cost intelligent maintenance. To achieve these requirements, we propose an integrated network architecture leveraging communications, computing, edge intelligence, and caching in railway systems. We have conducted in-depth investigations on key enabling technologies for reliable transmissions and wireless coverage. For high-speed mobile scenarios, we propose an AI-enabled cross-domain channel modeling and orthogonal time-frequency space-time spread multiple access mechanism to alleviate the conflict between limited spectrum availability and massive user access. The roles of blockchain, edge intelligence, and privacy technologies in endogenously secure rail communications are also evaluated. We further explore the application of emerging paradigms such as integrated sensing and communications, AI-assisted Internet of Things, semantic communications, and digital twin networks for railway maintenance, monitoring, prediction, and accident warning. Finally, possible future research and development directions are discussed.

Abstract: This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study, the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result, are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from 94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ pathologies.

Title: Regularized Model Predictive Control
Authors: Komeil Nosrati, Juri Belikov, Aleksei Tepljakov, Eduard Petlenkov
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC), the choice of cost-weighting matrices and designing the Hessian matrix directly affects the trade-off between rapid state regulation and minimizing the control effort. However, traditional MPC in quadratic programming relies on fixed design matrices across the entire horizon, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This letter presents a Riccati equation-based method for adjusting the design matrix within the MPC framework, which enhances real-time performance. We employ a penalized least-squares (PLS) approach to derive a quadratic cost function for a discrete-time linear system over a finite prediction horizon. Using the method of weighting and enforcing the constraint equation by introducing a large penalty parameter, we solve the constrained optimization problem and generate control inputs for forward-shifted horizons. This process yields a recursive PLS-based Riccati equation that updates the design matrix as a regularization term in each shift, forming the foundation of the regularized MPC (Re-MPC) algorithm. To accomplish this, we provide a convergence and stability analysis of the developed algorithm. Numerical analysis demonstrates its superiority over traditional methods by allowing Riccati equation-based adjustments.

Title: Enhancing Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) for Diffusion MRI: Is it Enough without Non-Diffusion-Weighted B=0 Reference?
Authors: Yinzhe Wu, Jiahao Huang, Fanwen Wang, Mengze Gao, Congyu Liao, Guang Yang, Kawin Setsompop
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is essential for studying brain microstructure, but high-resolution imaging remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventional methods often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images. However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics. In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios. Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.

Title: Algorithms for Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Location Estimation
Authors: Ophir Uziel, Efi Fogel, Dan Halperin, Sivan Toledo
Abstract: For three decades, carrier-phase observations have been used to obtain the most accurate location estimates using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These estimates are computed by minimizing a nonlinear mixed-integer least-squares problem. Existing algorithms linearize the problem, orthogonally project it to eliminate real variables, and then solve the integer least-square problem. There is now considerable interest in developing similar localization techniques for terrestrial and indoor settings. We show that algorithms that linearize first fail in these settings and we propose several algorithms for computing the estimates. Some of our algorithms are elimination algorithms that start by eliminating the non-linear terms in the constraints; others construct a geometric arrangement that allows us to efficiently enumerate integer solutions (in polynomial time). We focus on simplified localization problems in which the measurements are range (distance) measurements and carrier phase range measurements, with no nuisance parameters. The simplified problem allows us to focus on the core question of untangling the nonlinearity and the integer nature of some parameters. We show using simulations that the new algorithms are effective at close ranges at which the linearize-first approach fails.

Abstract: Reliable MRI defacing techniques to safeguard patient privacy while preserving brain anatomy are critical for research collaboration. Existing methods often struggle with incomplete defacing or degradation of brain tissue regions. We present a robust, generalisable defacing pipeline for high-resolution MRI that integrates atlas-based registration with brain masking. Our method was evaluated on 2,566 heterogeneous clinical scans for meningioma and achieved a 99.92 per cent success rate (2,564/2,566) upon visual inspection. Excellent anatomical preservation is demonstrated with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9975 plus or minus 0.0023 between brain masks automatically extracted from the original and defaced volumes.

Title: Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning
Authors: Dang Thoai Phan, Tuan Anh Huynh, Van Tuan Pham, Cao Minh Tran, Van Thuan Mai, Ngoc Quy Tran
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.

Title: The role of data partitioning on the performance of EEG-based deep learning models in supervised cross-subject analysis: a preliminary study
Authors: Federico Del Pup, Andrea Zanola, Louis Fabrice Tshimanga, Alessandra Bertoldo, Livio Finos, Manfredo Atzori
Abstract: Deep learning is significantly advancing the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data by effectively discovering highly nonlinear patterns within the signals. Data partitioning and cross-validation are crucial for assessing model performance and ensuring study comparability, as they can produce varied results and data leakage due to specific signal properties (e.g., biometric). Such variability leads to incomparable studies and, increasingly, overestimated performance claims, which are detrimental to the field. Nevertheless, no comprehensive guidelines for proper data partitioning and cross-validation exist in the domain, nor is there a quantitative evaluation of their impact on model accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. To assist researchers in identifying optimal experimental strategies, this paper thoroughly investigates the role of data partitioning and cross-validation in evaluating EEG deep learning models. Five cross-validation settings are compared across three supervised cross-subject classification tasks (BCI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease detection) and four established architectures of increasing complexity (ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and Temporal-based ResNet). The comparison of over 100,000 trained models underscores, first, the importance of using subject-based cross-validation strategies for evaluating EEG deep learning models, except when within-subject analyses are acceptable (e.g., BCI). Second, it highlights the greater reliability of nested approaches (N-LNSO) compared to non-nested counterparts, which are prone to data leakage and favor larger models overfitting to validation data. In conclusion, this work provides EEG deep learning researchers with an analysis of data partitioning and cross-validation and offers guidelines to avoid data leakage, currently undermining the domain with potentially overestimated performance claims.

Title: MDDM: A Multi-view Discriminative Enhanced Diffusion-based Model for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nan Xu, Zhaolong Huang, Xiaonan Zhi
Abstract: With the development of deep learning, speech enhancement has been greatly optimized in terms of speech quality. Previous methods typically focus on the discriminative supervised learning or generative modeling, which tends to introduce speech distortions or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose MDDM, a Multi-view Discriminative enhanced Diffusion-based Model. Specifically, we take the features of three domains (time, frequency and noise) as inputs of a discriminative prediction network, generating the preliminary spectrogram. Then, the discriminative output can be converted to clean speech by several inference sampling steps. Due to the intersection of the distributions between discriminative output and clean target, the smaller sampling steps can achieve the competitive performance compared to other diffusion-based methods. Experiments conducted on a public dataset and a realworld dataset validate the effectiveness of MDDM, either on subjective or objective metric.

Title: Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels
Authors: Jonathan Ott, Maximilian Stahlke, Tobias Feigl, Bjoern M. Eskofier, Christopher Mutschler
Abstract: We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.

Title: RSS-Based Localization: Ensuring Consistency and Asymptotic Efficiency
Authors: Shenghua Hu, Guangyang Zeng, Wenchao Xue, Haitao Fang, Junfeng Wu, Biqiang Mu
Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using received signal strength measurements. We begin by presenting verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment that ensure the model's asymptotic localizability. Then we establish the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, computing the ML estimator is challenging due to its reliance on solving a non-convex optimization problem. To overcome this, we propose a two-step estimator that retains the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of measurements. The main challenge lies in obtaining a consistent estimator in the first step. To address this, we construct two linear least-squares estimation problems by applying algebraic transformations to the nonlinear measurement model, leading to closed-form solutions. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the consistent estimator from the first step as the initialization, achieving the same asymptotic efficiency as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical property and practical effectiveness of the proposed two-step estimator.

Title: Stochastic Orthogonal Regularization for deep projective priors
Authors: Ali Joundi (UB), Yann Traonmilin (UB), Alasdair Newson (ISIR)
Abstract: Many crucial tasks of image processing and computer vision are formulated as inverse problems. Thus, it is of great importance to design fast and robust algorithms to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on generalized projected gradient descent (GPGD) algorithms where generalized projections are realized with learned neural networks and provide state-of-the-art results for imaging inverse problems. Indeed, neural networks allow for projections onto unknown low-dimensional sets that model complex data, such as images. We call these projections deep projective priors. In generic settings, when the orthogonal projection onto a lowdimensional model set is used, it has been shown, under a restricted isometry assumption, that the corresponding orthogonal PGD converges with a linear rate, yielding near-optimal convergence (within the class of GPGD methods) in the classical case of sparse recovery. However, for deep projective priors trained with classical mean squared error losses, there is little guarantee that the hypotheses for linear convergence are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a stochastic orthogonal regularization of the training loss for deep projective priors. This regularization is motivated by our theoretical results: a sufficiently good approximation of the orthogonal projection guarantees linear stable recovery with performance close to orthogonal PGD. We show experimentally, using two different deep projective priors (based on autoencoders and on denoising networks), that our stochastic orthogonal regularization yields projections that improve convergence speed and robustness of GPGD in challenging inverse problem settings, in accordance with our theoretical findings.

Title: Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer Learning as Graph Matching Based on Optimal Transport for ASR
Authors: Xugang Lu, Peng Shen, Yu Tsao, Hisashi Kawai
Abstract: Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to acoustic feature learning has proven effective in enhancing end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR). However, aligning representations between linguistic and acoustic modalities remains a challenge due to inherent modality gaps. Optimal transport (OT) has shown promise in mitigating these gaps by minimizing the Wasserstein distance (WD) between linguistic and acoustic feature distributions. However, previous OT-based methods overlook structural relationships, treating feature vectors as unordered sets. To address this, we propose Graph Matching Optimal Transport (GM-OT), which models linguistic and acoustic sequences as structured graphs. Nodes represent feature embeddings, while edges capture temporal and sequential relationships. GM-OT minimizes both WD (between nodes) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) (between edges), leading to a fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance (FGWD) formulation. This enables structured alignment and more efficient knowledge transfer compared to existing OT-based approaches. Theoretical analysis further shows that prior OT-based methods in linguistic knowledge transfer can be viewed as a special case within our GM-OT framework. We evaluate GM-OT on Mandarin ASR using a CTC-based E2E-ASR system with a PLM for knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Universal Semantic Disentangled Privacy-preserving Speech Representation Learning

Abstract: The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and $\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations.

Title: Higher fidelity perceptual image and video compression with a latent conditioned residual denoising diffusion model
Authors: Jonas Brenig, Radu Timofte
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models achieved impressive results on several image generation tasks often outperforming GAN based models. Recently, the generative capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar results.

Title: SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information
Authors: Chih-Kai Yang, Neo Ho, Yen-Ting Piao, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

Title: Distributed Beamforming Using Decentralized Time Synchronization in a Six-Element Array
Authors: Naim Shandi, Jason M. Merlo, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We demonstrate a distributed beamforming and beamsteering from a six-node distributed phased array using fully wireless coordination with decentralized time synchronization. In wireless applications such as distributed beamforming, high-accuracy time synchronization across the array is crucial for high coherent gain. The decentralized time synchronization method employed is based on the average consensus algorithm and the two-way time transfer method presented in our previous work, which achieved picosecond time synchronization with a cabled frequency reference. The system presented in this paper utilizes a centralized wireless frequency transfer method to achieve wireless frequency syntonization in a fully wireless coordination and a distributed computing system architecture. We experimentally evaluate system performance through beamforming and beamsteering to a receiver 16.3 m away from the six-node non-uniformly distributed antenna array, achieving an average coherent gain of 98% of the ideal gain at a carrier frequency of 1.05 GHz. The average time synchronization accuracy achieved was less than 36 ps.

Title: Low-regret Strategies for Energy Systems Planning in a Highly Uncertain Future
Authors: Gabriel Wiest, Niklas Nolzen, Florian Baader, André Bardow, Stefano Moret
Abstract: Large uncertainties in the energy transition urge decision-makers to develop low-regret strategies, i.e., strategies that perform well regardless of how the future unfolds. To address this challenge, we introduce a decision-support framework that identifies low-regret strategies in energy system planning under uncertainty. Our framework (i) automatically identifies strategies, (ii) evaluates their performance in terms of regret, (iii) assesses the key drivers of regret, and (iv) supports the decision process with intuitive decision trees, regret curves and decision maps. We apply the framework to evaluate the optimal use of biomass in the transition to net-zero energy systems, considering all major biomass utilization options: biofuels, biomethane, chemicals, hydrogen, biochar, electricity, and heat. Producing fuels and chemicals from biomass performs best across various decision-making criteria. In contrast, the current use of biomass, mainly for low-temperature heat supply, results in high regret, making it a must-avoid in the energy transition.

Title: Output behavior equivalence and simultaneous subspace identification of systems and faults
Authors: Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a system subject to additive faults, while simultaneously reconstructing the fault signal via subspace methods. We do not require nominal data for the identification, neither do we impose any assumption on the class of faults, e.g., sensor or actuator faults. We show that, under mild assumptions on the fault signal, standard PI-MOESP can recover the system matrices associated to the input-output subsystem. Then we introduce the concept of output behavior equivalence, which characterizes systems with the same output behavior set, and present a method to establish this equivalence from system matrices. Finally, we show how to estimate from data the complete set of fault matrices for which there exist a fault signal with minimal dimension that explains the data.

Title: Frequency-Dependent Power Consumption Modeling of CMOS Transmitters for WNoC Architectures
Authors: Mohammad Shahmoradi, Korkut Kaan Tokgöz, Eduard Alarcón, Sergi Abadal
Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) systems, which wirelessly interconnect the chips of a computing system, have been proposed as a complement to existing chip-to-chip wired links. However, their feasibility depends on the availability of custom-designed high-speed, tiny, ultra-efficient transceivers. This represents a challenge due to the tradeoffs between bandwidth, area, and energy efficiency that are found as frequency increases, which suggests that there is an optimal frequency region. To aid in the search for such an optimal design point, this paper presents a behavioral model that quantifies the expected power consumption of oscillators, mixers, and power amplifiers as a function of frequency. The model is built on extensive surveys of the respective sub-blocks, all based on experimental data. By putting together the models of the three sub-blocks, a comprehensive power model is obtained, which will aid in selecting the optimal operating frequency for WNoC systems.

Title: Quantum Hardware-in-the-Loop for Optimal Power Flow in Renewable-Integrated Power Systems
Authors: Zeynab Kaseb, Rahul Rane, Aleksandra Lekic, Matthias Moller, Amin Khodaei, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept for integrating quantum hardware with real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to model and control modern power systems, including renewable energy resources. Power flow (PF) analysis and optimal power flow (OPF) studies are conducted using RTDS coupled with Fujitsu's CMOS Digital Annealer and D-Wave's Advantage quantum processors. The adiabatic quantum power flow (AQPF) and adiabatic quantum optimal power flow (AQOPF) algorithms are used to perform PF and OPF, respectively, on quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are performed on the IEEE 9-bus test system and a modified version that includes solar and wind farms. The findings demonstrate that the AQPF and AQOPF algorithms can accurately perform PF and OPF, yielding results that closely match those of classical Newton-Raphson (NR) solvers while also exhibiting robust convergence. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) within the AQOPF framework proves effective in maintaining system stability and performance, even under variable generation conditions. These findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to significantly enhance the modeling and control of future power grids, particularly in systems with high renewable energy penetration.

Title: An Empirical Bayes approach to ARX Estimation
Authors: Timofei Leahu, Giorgio Picci
Abstract: Empirical Bayes inference is based on estimation of the parameters of an a priori distribution from the observed data. The estimation technique of the parameters of the prior, called hyperparameters, is based on the marginal distribution obtained by integrating the joint density of the model with respect to the prior. This is a key step which needs to be properly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper we study Empirical Bayes inference of linear autoregressive models with inputs (ARX models) for time series and compare the performance of the marginal parametric estimator with that a full Empirical Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior. Such a comparison, can only make sense for a (realistic) finite data length. In this setting, we propose a new estimation technique of the hyperparameters by a sequential Bayes procedure which is essentially a backward Kalman filter. It turns out that for finite data length the marginal Bayes tends to behave slightly better than the full Empirical Bayesian parameter estimator and so also in the case of slowly varying random parameters.

Title: Beyond-Diagonal RIS Prototype and Performance Evaluation
Authors: Jean Tapie, Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx, Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: We present the first experimental prototype of a reflective beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), i.e., a RIS with reconfigurable inter-element connections. Our BD-RIS consists of an antenna array whose ports are terminated by a tunable load network. The latter can terminate each antenna port with three distinct individual loads or connect it to an adjacent antenna port. Extensive performance evaluations in a rich-scattering environment validate that inter-element connections are beneficial. Moreover, we observe that our tunable load network's mentioned hardware constraints significantly influence, first, the achievable performance, second, the benefits of having inter-element connections, and, third, the importance of mutual-coupling awareness during optimization.

Title: GuidedMorph: Two-Stage Deformable Registration for Breast MRI
Authors: Yaqian Chen, Hanxue Gu, Haoyu Dong, Qihang Li, Yuwen Chen, Nicholas Konz, Lin Li, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Accurately registering breast MR images from different time points enables the alignment of anatomical structures and tracking of tumor progression, supporting more effective breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. However, the complexity of dense tissue and its highly non-rigid nature pose challenges for conventional registration methods, which primarily focus on aligning general structures while overlooking intricate internal details. To address this, we propose \textbf{GuidedMorph}, a novel two-stage registration framework designed to better align dense tissue. In addition to a single-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework that utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned transformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer Network (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method based on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately warp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural details during deformation. The framework supports paradigms that require external segmentation models and with image data only. It also operates effectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile solution for breast registration. We validate our method on ISPY2 and internal dataset, demonstrating superior performance in dense tissue, overall breast alignment, and breast structural similarity index measure (SSIM), with notable improvements by over 13.01% in dense tissue Dice, 3.13% in breast Dice, and 1.21% in breast SSIM compared to the best learning-based baseline.

Title: The Value of Information in Multi-Scale Feedback Systems
Authors: Louisa Jane Di Felice, Ada Diaconescu, Payam Zahadat, Patricia Mellodge
Abstract: Complex adaptive systems (CAS) can be described as systems of information flows dynamically interacting across scales in order to adapt and survive. CAS often consist of many components that work towards a shared goal, and interact across different informational scales through feedback loops, leading to their adaptation. In this context, understanding how information is transmitted among system components and across scales becomes crucial for understanding the behavior of CAS. Shannon entropy, a measure of syntactic information, is often used to quantify the size and rarity of messages transmitted between objects and observers, but it does not measure the value that information has for each specific observer. For this, semantic and pragmatic information have been conceptualized as describing the influence on an observer's knowledge and actions. Building on this distinction, we describe the architecture of multi-scale information flows in CAS through the concept of Multi-Scale Feedback Systems, and propose a series of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information measures to quantify the value of information flows. While the measurement of values is necessarily context-dependent, we provide general guidelines on how to calculate semantic and pragmatic measures, and concrete examples of their calculation through four case studies: a robotic collective model, a collective decision-making model, a task distribution model, and a hierarchical oscillator model. Our results contribute to an informational theory of complexity, aiming to better understand the role played by information in the behavior of Multi-Scale Feedback Systems.

Title: SELECT: A Submodular Approach for Active LiDAR Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Ruiyu Mao, Sarthak Kumar Maharana, Xulong Tang, Yunhui Guo
Abstract: LiDAR-based semantic segmentation plays a vital role in autonomous driving by enabling detailed understanding of 3D environments. However, annotating LiDAR point clouds is extremely costly and requires assigning semantic labels to millions of points with complex geometric structures. Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce labeling costs by querying only the most informative samples. Yet, existing AL methods face critical challenges when applied to large-scale 3D data: outdoor scenes contain an overwhelming number of points and suffer from severe class imbalance, where rare classes have far fewer points than dominant classes. To address these issues, we propose SELECT, a voxel-centric submodular approach tailored for active LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our method targets both scalability problems and class imbalance through three coordinated stages. First, we perform Voxel-Level Submodular Subset Selection, which efficiently identifies representative voxels without pairwise comparisons, ensuring scalability. Second, we estimate Voxel-Level Model Uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout, aggregating point-wise uncertainties to identify informative voxels. Finally, we introduce Submodular Maximization for Point-Level Class Balancing, which selects a subset of points that enhances label diversity, explicitly mitigating class imbalance. Experiments on SemanticPOSS, SemanticKITTI, and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SELECT achieves superior performance compared to prior active learning approaches for 3D semantic segmentation.

Title: Improving Open-Set Semantic Segmentation in 3D Point Clouds by Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization: Preliminary Results
Authors: Wang Fang, Shirin Rahimi, Olivia Bennett, Sophie Carter, Mitra Hassani, Xu Lan, Omid Javadi, Lucas Mitchell
Abstract: Point-cloud semantic segmentation underpins a wide range of critical applications. Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have driven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or properly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked interest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.

Title: Object-Centric Representations Improve Policy Generalization in Robot Manipulation
Authors: Alexandre Chapin (imagine), Bruno Machado (imagine), Emmanuel Dellandrea (imagine), Liming Chen (imagine)
Abstract: Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities, introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks. We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

Title: ASR-FAIRBENCH: Measuring and Benchmarking Equity Across Speech Recognition Systems
Authors: Anand Rai, Satyam Rahangdale, Utkarsh Anand, Animesh Mukherjee
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous in everyday applications, yet significant disparities in performance across diverse demographic groups persist. In this work, we introduce the ASR-FAIRBENCH leaderboard which is designed to assess both the accuracy and equity of ASR models in real-time. Leveraging the Meta's Fair-Speech dataset, which captures diverse demographic characteristics, we employ a mixed-effects Poisson regression model to derive an overall fairness score. This score is integrated with traditional metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to compute the Fairness Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS), providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our approach reveals significant performance disparities in SOTA ASR models across demographic groups and offers a benchmark to drive the development of more inclusive ASR technologies.

Title: Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges
Authors: Pengrui Quan, Brian Wang, Kang Yang, Liying Han, Mani Srivastava
Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

Title: Joint Graph Estimation and Signal Restoration for Robust Federated Learning
Authors: Tsutahiro Fukuhara, Junya Hara, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka
Abstract: We propose a robust aggregation method for model parameters in federated learning (FL) under noisy communications. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which a central server aggregates local model parameters from multiple clients. These parameters are often noisy and/or have missing values during data collection, training, and communication between the clients and server. This may cause a considerable drop in model accuracy. To address this issue, we learn a graph that represents pairwise relationships between model parameters of the clients during aggregation. We realize it with a joint problem of graph learning and signal (i.e., model parameters) restoration. The problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization, which is efficiently solved via a proximal DC algorithm. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches by up to $2$--$5\%$ in classification accuracy under biased data distributions and noisy conditions.

Title: On the Sharp Input-Output Analysis of Nonlinear Systems under Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Jihun Kim, Yuchen Fang, Javad Lavaei
Abstract: This paper is concerned with learning the input-output mapping of general nonlinear dynamical systems. While the existing literature focuses on Gaussian inputs and benign disturbances, we significantly broaden the scope of admissible control inputs and allow correlated, nonzero-mean, adversarial disturbances. With our reformulation as a linear combination of basis functions, we prove that the $l_1$-norm estimator overcomes the challenges as long as the probability that the system is under adversarial attack at a given time is smaller than a certain threshold. We provide an estimation error bound that decays with the input memory length and prove its optimality by constructing a problem instance that suffers from the same bound under adversarial attacks. Our work provides a sharp input-output analysis for a generic nonlinear and partially observed system under significantly generalized assumptions compared to existing works.

Title: Automatic Speech Recognition for African Low-Resource Languages: Challenges and Future Directions
Authors: Sukairaj Hafiz Imam, Babangida Sani, Dawit Ketema Gete, Bedru Yimam Ahamed, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, Idris Abdulmumin, Seid Muhie Yimam, Muhammad Yahuza Bello, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications. This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection, self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical, efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic participation for speakers of African languages.

Title: UGoDIT: Unsupervised Group Deep Image Prior Via Transferable Weights
Authors: Shijun Liang, Ismail R. Alkhouri, Siddhant Gautam, Qing Qu, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models (e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled (clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific settings such as dynamic imaging. On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior (DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency. We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training data.

Title: Semantically-Aware Game Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Kai Zhu, Vignesh Edithal, Le Zhang, Ilia Blank, Imran Junejo
Abstract: Assessing the visual quality of video game graphics presents unique challenges due to the absence of reference images and the distinct types of distortions, such as aliasing, texture blur, and geometry level of detail (LOD) issues, which differ from those in natural images or user-generated content. Existing no-reference image and video quality assessment (NR-IQA/VQA) methods fail to generalize to gaming environments as they are primarily designed for distortions like compression artifacts. This study introduces a semantically-aware NR-IQA model tailored to gaming. The model employs a knowledge-distilled Game distortion feature extractor (GDFE) to detect and quantify game-specific distortions, while integrating semantic gating via CLIP embeddings to dynamically weight feature importance based on scene content. Training on gameplay data recorded across graphical quality presets enables the model to produce quality scores that align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that the GDFE, trained through knowledge distillation from binary classifiers, generalizes effectively to intermediate distortion levels unseen during training. Semantic gating further improves contextual relevance and reduces prediction variance. In the absence of in-domain NR-IQA baselines, our model outperforms out-of-domain methods and exhibits robust, monotonic quality trends across unseen games in the same genre. This work establishes a foundation for automated graphical quality assessment in gaming, advancing NR-IQA methods in this domain.

Title: Study of Robust Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Multiple-Antenna Networks
Authors: S. Mashdour, A. Flores, R. C. de Lamare
Abstract: Cell-free networks outperform cellular networks in many aspects, yet their efficiency is affected by imperfect channel state information (CSI). In order to address this issue, this work presents a robust resource allocation framework designed for the downlink of user-centric cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. This framework employs a sequential resource allocation strategy with a robust user scheduling algorithm designed to maximize the sum-rate of the network and two robust power allocation algorithms aimed at minimizing the mean square error, which are developed to mitigate the effects of imperfect CSI. An analysis of the proposed robust resource allocation problems is developed along with a study of their computational cost. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust resource allocation algorithms, showing a performance improvement of up to 30\% compared to existing techniques.

Title: Communication-Efficient Hybrid Language Model via Uncertainty-Aware Opportunistic and Compressed Transmission
Authors: Seungeun Oh, Jinhyuk Kim, Jihong Park, Seung-Woo Ko, Jinho Choi, Tony Q. S. Quek, Seong-Lyun Kim
Abstract: To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model (LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability. Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while maintaining 97.4% accuracy.

Title: Robustness of Incentive Mechanisms Against System Misspecification in Congestion Games
Authors: Chih-Yuan Chiu, Bryce L. Ferguson
Abstract: To steer the behavior of selfish, resource-sharing agents in a socio-technical system towards the direction of higher efficiency, the system designer requires accurate models of both agent behaviors and the underlying system infrastructure. For instance, traffic controllers often use road latency models to design tolls whose deployment can effectively mitigate traffic congestion. However, misspecifications of system parameters may restrict a system designer's ability to influence collective agent behavior toward efficient outcomes. In this work, we study the impact of system misspecifications on toll design for atomic congestion games. We prove that tolls designed under sufficiently minor system misspecifications, when deployed, do not introduce new Nash equilibria in atomic congestion games compared to tolls designed in the noise-free setting, implying a form of local robustness. We then upper bound the degree to which the worst-case equilibrium system performance could decrease when tolls designed under a given level of system misspecification are deployed. We validate our theoretical results via Monte-Carlo simulations as well as realizations of our worst-case guarantees.

Title: CL-CaGAN: Capsule differential adversarial continuous learning for cross-domain hyperspectral anomaly detection
Authors: Jianing Wang, Siying Guo, Zheng Hua, Runhu Huang, Jinyu Hu, Maoguo Gong
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.

Title: Self-Learning Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion via Adaptive Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model
Authors: Jian Zhu, He Wang, Yang Xu, Zebin Wu, Zhihui Wei
Abstract: Hyperspectral and multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion involves combining a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM), which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field of HSI-MSI fusion.

Title: PyScrew: A Comprehensive Dataset Collection from Industrial Screw Driving Experiments
Authors: Nikolai West, Jochen Deuse
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive collection of industrial screw driving datasets designed to advance research in manufacturing process monitoring and quality control. The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing, this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.

Title: LLM-guided DRL for Multi-tier LEO Satellite Networks with Hybrid FSO/RF Links
Authors: Jiahui Li, Geng Sun, Zemin Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Yinqiu Liu, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Shiwen Mao
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in terrestrial networks, inherent limitations persist in providing reliable coverage to remote areas and maintaining resilience during natural disasters. Multi-tier networks with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) offer promising solutions, but face challenges from high mobility and dynamic channel conditions that cause unstable connections and frequent handovers. In this paper, we design a three-tier network architecture that integrates LEO satellites, HAPs, and ground terminals with hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links to maximize coverage while maintaining connectivity reliability. This hybrid approach leverages the high bandwidth of FSO for satellite-to-HAP links and the weather resilience of RF for HAP-to-ground links. We formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously balance downlink transmission rate and handover frequency by optimizing network configuration and satellite handover decisions. The problem is highly dynamic and non-convex with time-coupled constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-guided truncated quantile critics algorithm with dynamic action masking (LTQC-DAM) that utilizes dynamic action masking to eliminate unnecessary exploration and employs LLMs to adaptively tune hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LTQC-DAM algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of convergence, downlink transmission rate, and handover frequency. We also reveal that compared to other state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek delivers the best performance through gradual, contextually-aware parameter adjustments.

Title: Multi-Attribute Graph Estimation with Sparse-Group Non-Convex Penalties
Authors: Jitendra K Tugnait
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional Gaussian vectors from multi-attribute data. Most existing methods for graph estimation are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar random variable with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning using a penalized log-likelihood objective function. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and sparse-group non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach coupled with local linear approximation to non-convex penalties is presented for optimization of the objective function. For non-convex penalties, theoretical analysis establishing local consistency in support recovery, local convexity and precision matrix estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided under two sets of sufficient conditions: with and without some irrepresentability conditions. We illustrate our approaches using both synthetic and real-data numerical examples. In the synthetic data examples the sparse-group log-sum penalized objective function significantly outperformed the lasso penalized as well as SCAD penalized objective functions with $F_1$-score and Hamming distance as performance metrics.

Title: A VCSEL based Photonic Neuromorphic Processor for Event-Based Imaging Flow Cytometry Applications
Authors: M. Skontranis, G. Moustakas, A. Bogris, C. Mesaritakis
Abstract: This work presents an optical neuromorphic imaging and processing cytometry system that integrates an excitable VCSEL-based time-delayed (TD) extreme learning machine with an event-based 2D camera. The proposed system is designed for the classification of Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) particles of varying diameters moving at speeds between 0.01 and 0.1 m/s. The TD photonic scheme achieved a classification accuracy of 95.8% while encoding the original 2D images into a 1-bit spike stream containing a maximum of 96 spikes. Additionally, the binary representation of the synthetic frames enables a significant reduction in memory and hardware requirements, ranging from 98.4% to 99.5% and 50% to 84%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the integration of neuromorphic computing with sensing can facilitate the development of low-power, low-latency applications optimized for resource-constrained environments

Title: SepPrune: Structured Pruning for Efficient Deep Speech Separation
Authors: Yuqi Li, Kai Li, Xin Yin, Zhifei Yang, Junhao Dong, Zeyu Dong, Chuanguang Yang, Yingli Tian, Yao Lu
Abstract: Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost. SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection. Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than training from scratch.

Title: Behind the Screens: Uncovering Bias in AI-Driven Video Interview Assessments Using Counterfactuals
Authors: Dena F. Mujtaba, Nihar R. Mahapatra
Abstract: AI-enhanced personality assessments are increasingly shaping hiring decisions, using affective computing to predict traits from the Big Five (OCEAN) model. However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical concerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like gender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a counterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in AI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by altering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the underlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or static data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio, and textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in high-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide AI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction model, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We also validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm the effectiveness of our counterfactual generation. This work provides a scalable tool for fairness auditing of commercial AI hiring platforms, especially in black-box settings where training data and model internals are inaccessible. Our results highlight the importance of counterfactual approaches in improving ethical transparency in affective computing.

Title: T-Rex: Fitting a Robust Factor Model via Expectation-Maximization
Authors: Daniel Cederberg
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been a surge of interest in studying low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional data. Statistical factor models $-$ i.e., low-rank plus diagonal covariance structures $-$ offer a powerful framework for modeling such structures. However, traditional methods for fitting statistical factor models, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or maximum likelihood estimation assuming the data is Gaussian, are highly sensitive to heavy tails and outliers in the observed data. In this paper, we propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for robustly fitting statistical factor models. Our approach is based on Tyler's M-estimator of the scatter matrix for an elliptical distribution, and consists of solving Tyler's maximum likelihood estimation problem while imposing a structural constraint that enforces the low-rank plus diagonal covariance structure. We present numerical experiments on both synthetic and real examples, demonstrating the robustness of our method for direction-of-arrival estimation in nonuniform noise and subspace recovery.

Title: Learning to Highlight Audio by Watching Movies
Authors: Chao Huang, Ruohan Gao, J. M. F. Tsang, Jan Kurcius, Cagdas Bilen, Chenliang Xu, Anurag Kumar, Sanjeel Parekh
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant increase in video content creation and consumption. Crafting engaging content requires the careful curation of both visual and audio elements. While visual cue curation, through techniques like optimal viewpoint selection or post-editing, has been central to media production, its natural counterpart, audio, has not undergone equivalent advancements. This often results in a disconnect between visual and acoustic saliency. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: visually-guided acoustic highlighting, which aims to transform audio to deliver appropriate highlighting effects guided by the accompanying video, ultimately creating a more harmonious audio-visual experience. We propose a flexible, transformer-based multimodal framework to solve this task. To train our model, we also introduce a new dataset -- the muddy mix dataset, leveraging the meticulous audio and video crafting found in movies, which provides a form of free supervision. We develop a pseudo-data generation process to simulate poorly mixed audio, mimicking real-world scenarios through a three-step process -- separation, adjustment, and remixing. Our approach consistently outperforms several baselines in both quantitative and subjective evaluation. We also systematically study the impact of different types of contextual guidance and difficulty levels of the dataset. Our project page is here: this https URL.

Title: BenSParX: A Robust Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Parkinson's Disease Detection from Bengali Conversational Speech
Authors: Riad Hossain, Muhammad Ashad Kabir, Arat Ibne Golam Mowla, Animesh Chandra Roy, Ranjit Kumar Ghosh
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing global health challenge, with Bangladesh experiencing a notable rise in PD-related mortality. Early detection of PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where voice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective alternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other major languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a significant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare solutions. Moreover, most prior studies employed only a narrow set of acoustic features, with limited or no hyperparameter tuning and feature selection strategies, and little attention to model explainability. This restricts the development of a robust and generalizable machine learning model. To address this gap, we present BenSparX, the first Bengali conversational speech dataset for PD detection, along with a robust and explainable machine learning framework tailored for early diagnosis. The proposed framework incorporates diverse acoustic feature categories, systematic feature selection methods, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with extensive hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability and trust in model predictions, the framework incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to quantify the contribution of individual acoustic features toward PD detection. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an accuracy of 95.77%, F1 score of 95.57%, and AUC-ROC of 0.982. We further externally validated our approach by applying the framework to existing PD datasets in other languages, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, the dataset has been made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Receiver Quantization in Communication
Authors: Jing Zhou, Shuqin Pang, Wenyi Zhang
Abstract: We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies, this work is more focused on the impact of resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes i.i.d. complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is $\log\left(1+\gamma\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where $\gamma$ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the MSE also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by $\log\left(1+\mathsf {mmse}\cdot\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and is equal to the minimum of $\gamma$. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, including how small rate losses decay to zero and achievable rate approximations under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several per-bit rules for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general.

Title: Finite-time stabilization of ladder multi-level quantum systems
Authors: Zeping Su, Sen Kuang, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: In this paper, a novel continuous non-smooth control strategy is proposed to achieve finite-time stabilization of ladder quantum systems. We first design a universal fractional-order control law for a ladder n-level quantum system using a distance-based Lyapunov function, and then apply the Filippov solution in the sense of differential inclusions and the LaSalle's invariance principle to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the ladder system under the continuous non-smooth control law. Both asymptotic stability and finite-time stability for the ladder system is rigorously established by applying Lyapunov stability theory and finite-time stability criteria. We also derive an upper bound of the time required for convergence to an eigenstate of the intrinsic Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations on a rubidium ladder three-level atomic system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning
Authors: Qianyue Hu, Junyan Wu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at this https URL.

Authors: Georgiy Malaniya, Anton Bolychev, Grigory Yaremenko, Anastasia Krasnaya, Pavel Osinenko
Abstract: We introduce Multi-CALF, an algorithm that intelligently combines reinforcement learning policies based on their relative value improvements. Our approach integrates a standard RL policy with a theoretically-backed alternative policy, inheriting formal stability guarantees while often achieving better performance than either policy individually. We prove that our combined policy converges to a specified goal set with known probability and provide precise bounds on maximum deviation and convergence time. Empirical validation on control tasks demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining stability guarantees.

Title: A universal policy wrapper with guarantees
Authors: Anton Bolychev, Georgiy Malaniya, Grigory Yaremenko, Anastasia Krasnaya, Pavel Osinenko
Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement learning architectures and tasks.

Title: Adaptive MPC-based quadrupedal robot control under periodic disturbances
Authors: Elizaveta Pestova, Ilya Osokin, Danil Belov, Pavel Osinenko
Abstract: Recent advancements in adaptive control for reference trajectory tracking enable quadrupedal robots to perform locomotion tasks under challenging conditions. There are methods enabling the estimation of the external disturbances in terms of forces and torques. However, a specific case of disturbances that are periodic was not explicitly tackled in application to quadrupeds. This work is devoted to the estimation of the periodic disturbances with a lightweight regressor using simplified robot dynamics and extracting the disturbance properties in terms of the magnitude and frequency. Experimental evidence suggests performance improvement over the baseline static disturbance compensation.

Title: Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Keke Ying, Zhen Gao, Sheng Chen, Tony Q.S. Quek, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.

Title: Unleashing Automated Congestion Control Customization in the Wild
Authors: Amit Cohen, Lev Gloukhenki, Ravid Hadar, Eden Itah, Yehuda Shvut, Michael Schapira
Abstract: Congestion control (CC) crucially impacts user experience across Internet services like streaming, gaming, AR/VR, and connected cars. Traditionally, CC algorithm design seeks universal control rules that yield high performance across diverse application domains and networks. However, varying service needs and network conditions challenge this approach. We share operational experience with a system that automatically customizes congestion control logic to service needs and network conditions. We discuss design, deployment challenges, and solutions, highlighting performance benefits through case studies in streaming, gaming, connected cars, and more. Our system leverages PCC Vivace, an online-learning based congestion control protocol developed by researchers. Hence, along with insights from customizing congestion control, we also discuss lessons learned and modifications made to adapt PCC Vivace for real-world deployment.

Title: Exploring Sparsity for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning Using Wavelets
Authors: Ahmet Bilican, M. Akın Yılmaz, A. Murat Tekalp, R. Gökberk Cinbiş
Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.

Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning-Based Locomotion for Resource-Constrained Quadrupeds with Exteroceptive Sensing
Authors: Davide Plozza, Patricia Apostol, Paul Joseph, Simon Schläpfer, Michele Magno
Abstract: Compact quadrupedal robots are proving increasingly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively. We open-source our training code at this http URL.

Title: Event-based Star Tracking under Spacecraft Jitter: the e-STURT Dataset
Authors: Samya Bagchi, Peter Anastasiou, Matthew Tetlow, Tat-Jun Chin, Yasir Latif
Abstract: Jitter degrades a spacecraft's fine-pointing ability required for optical communication, earth observation, and space domain awareness. Development of jitter estimation and compensation algorithms requires high-fidelity sensor observations representative of on-board jitter. In this work, we present the Event-based Star Tracking Under Jitter (e-STURT) dataset -- the first event camera based dataset of star observations under controlled jitter conditions. Specialized hardware employed for the dataset emulates an event-camera undergoing on-board jitter. While the event camera provides asynchronous, high temporal resolution star observations, systematic and repeatable jitter is introduced using a micrometer accurate piezoelectric actuator. Various jitter sources are simulated using distinct frequency bands and utilizing both axes of motion. Ground-truth jitter is captured in hardware from the piezoelectric actuator. The resulting dataset consists of 200 sequences and is made publicly available. This work highlights the dataset generation process, technical challenges and the resulting limitations. To serve as a baseline, we propose a high-frequency jitter estimation algorithm that operates directly on the event stream. The e-STURT dataset will enable the development of jitter aware algorithms for mission critical event-based space sensing applications.

Title: Chain-Talker: Chain Understanding and Rendering for Empathetic Conversational Speech Synthesis
Authors: Yifan Hu, Rui Liu, Yi Ren, Xiang Yin, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to align synthesized speech with the emotional and stylistic context of user-agent interactions to achieve empathy. Current generative CSS models face interpretability limitations due to insufficient emotional perception and redundant discrete speech coding. To address the above issues, we present Chain-Talker, a three-stage framework mimicking human cognition: Emotion Understanding derives context-aware emotion descriptors from dialogue history; Semantic Understanding generates compact semantic codes via serialized prediction; and Empathetic Rendering synthesizes expressive speech by integrating both components. To support emotion modeling, we develop CSS-EmCap, an LLM-driven automated pipeline for generating precise conversational speech emotion captions. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Chain-Talker produces more expressive and empathetic speech than existing methods, with CSS-EmCap contributing to reliable emotion modeling. The code and demos are available at: this https URL.

Title: MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter
Authors: Jiazhu Li, Jian Kuang, Xiaoji, Niu
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.

Title: Text2midi-InferAlign: Improving Symbolic Music Generation with Inference-Time Alignment
Authors: Abhinaba Roy, Geeta Puri, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption, and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

Title: RoVo: Robust Voice Protection Against Unauthorized Speech Synthesis with Embedding-Level Perturbations
Authors: Seungmin Kim, Sohee Park, Donghyun Kim, Jisu Lee, Daeseon Choi
Abstract: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat. In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.

Title: Identifiability of Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions -- Part I: Theory
Authors: Subhayan Saha, Giovanni Barbarino, Nicolas Gillis
Abstract: Tensor decompositions have become a central tool in data science, with applications in areas such as data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD. Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures, using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor.

Title: SounDiT: Geo-Contextual Soundscape-to-Landscape Generation
Authors: Junbo Wang, Haofeng Tan, Bowen Liao, Albert Jiang, Teng Fei, Qixing Huang, Zhengzhong Tu, Shan Ye, Yuhao Kang
Abstract: We present a novel and practically significant problem-Geo-Contextual Soundscape-to-Landscape (GeoS2L) generation-which aims to synthesize geographically realistic landscape images from environmental soundscapes. Prior audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets, SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI, geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.

Title: OZSpeech: One-step Zero-shot Speech Synthesis with Learned-Prior-Conditioned Flow Matching
Authors: Hieu-Nghia Huynh-Nguyen, Ngoc Son Nguyen, Huynh Nguyen Dang, Thieu Vo, Truong-Son Hy, Van Nguyen
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style preservation.

Title: 2T1R Regulated Memristor Conductance Control Array Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing using 28nm CMOS Technology
Authors: Neethu Kuriakose (1), Arun Ashok (1), Christian Grewing (1), André Zambanini (1), Stefan van Waasen (1,2) ((1) Central Institute of Engineering, Electronics and Analytics -- Electronic Systems (ZEA-2), Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, 52425 Jülich, Germany, (2) Faculty of Engineering, Communication Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, Germany)
Abstract: Memristors are promising devices for scalable and low power, in-memory computing to improve the energy efficiency of a rising computational demand. The crossbar array architecture with memristors is used for vector matrix multiplication (VMM) and acts as kernels in neuromorphic computing. The analog conductance control in a memristor is achieved by applying voltage or current through it. A basic 1T1R array is suitable to avoid sneak path issues but suffer from wire resistances, which affects the read and write procedures. A conductance control scheme with a regulated voltage source will improve the architecture and reduce the possible potential divider effects. A change in conductance is also possible with the provision of a regulated current source and measuring the voltage across the memristors. A regulated 2T1R memristor conductance control architecture is proposed in this work, which avoids the potential divider effect and virtual ground scenario in a regular crossbar scheme, as well as conductance control by passing a regulated current through memristors. The sneak path current is not allowed to pass by the provision of ground potential to both terminals of memristors.

Title: Towards a Universal Image Degradation Model via Content-Degradation Disentanglement
Authors: Wenbo Yang, Zhongling Wang, Zhou Wang
Abstract: Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects. Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at this http URL.

Title: Unified Cross-modal Translation of Score Images, Symbolic Music, and Performance Audio
Authors: Jongmin Jung, Dongmin Kim, Sihun Lee, Seola Cho, Hyungjoon Soh, Irmak Bukey, Chris Donahue, Dasaem Jeong
Abstract: Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores, MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription (audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score). However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach, where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%, while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in cross-modal music generation.

Title: The Computation of Generalized Embeddings for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition using Contrastive Learning
Authors: Hilde I. Hummel, Arwin Gansekoele, Sandjai Bhulai, Rob van der Mei
Abstract: The increasing level of sound pollution in marine environments poses an increased threat to ocean health, making it crucial to monitor underwater noise. By monitoring this noise, the sources responsible for this pollution can be mapped. Monitoring is performed by passively listening to these sounds. This generates a large amount of data records, capturing a mix of sound sources such as ship activities and marine mammal vocalizations. Although machine learning offers a promising solution for automatic sound classification, current state-of-the-art methods implement supervised learning. This requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data that is not publicly available. In contrast, a massive amount of lower-quality unlabeled data is publicly available, offering the opportunity to explore unsupervised learning techniques. This research explores this possibility by implementing an unsupervised Contrastive Learning approach. Here, a Conformer-based encoder is optimized by the so-called Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization loss function on these lower-quality unlabeled data and the translation to the labeled data is made. Through classification tasks involving recognizing ship types and marine mammal vocalizations, our method demonstrates to produce robust and generalized embeddings. This shows to potential of unsupervised methods for various automatic underwater acoustic analysis tasks.

Title: Personalized Fine-Tuning with Controllable Synthetic Speech from LLM-Generated Transcripts for Dysarthric Speech Recognition
Authors: Dominik Wagner, Ilja Baumann, Natalie Engert, Seanie Lee, Elmar Nöth, Korbinian Riedhammer, Tobias Bocklet
Abstract: In this work, we present our submission to the Speech Accessibility Project challenge for dysarthric speech recognition. We integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning with latent audio representations to improve an encoder-decoder ASR system. Synthetic training data is generated by fine-tuning Parler-TTS to mimic dysarthric speech, using LLM-generated prompts for corpus-consistent target transcripts. Personalization with x-vectors consistently reduces word error rates (WERs) over non-personalized fine-tuning. AdaLoRA adapters outperform full fine-tuning and standard low-rank adaptation, achieving relative WER reductions of ~23% and ~22%, respectively. Further improvements (~5% WER reduction) come from incorporating wav2vec 2.0-based audio representations. Training with synthetic dysarthric speech yields up to ~7% relative WER improvement over personalized fine-tuning alone.

Title: Codec-Based Deepfake Source Tracing via Neural Audio Codec Taxonomy
Authors: Xuanjun Chen, I-Ming Lin, Lin Zhang, Jiawei Du, Haibin Wu, Hung-yi Lee, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang
Abstract: Recent advances in neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models have produced remarkably realistic audio deepfakes. We refer to deepfake speech generated by CoSG systems as codec-based deepfake, or CodecFake. Although existing anti-spoofing research on CodecFake predominantly focuses on verifying the authenticity of audio samples, almost no attention was given to tracing the CoSG used in generating these deepfakes. In CodecFake generation, processes such as speech-to-unit encoding, discrete unit modeling, and unit-to-speech decoding are fundamentally based on neural audio codecs. Motivated by this, we introduce source tracing for CodecFake via neural audio codec taxonomy, which dissects neural audio codecs to trace CoSG. Our experimental results on the CodecFake+ dataset provide promising initial evidence for the feasibility of CodecFake source tracing while also highlighting several challenges that warrant further investigation.

Title: DualCodec: A Low-Frame-Rate, Semantically-Enhanced Neural Audio Codec for Speech Generation
Authors: Jiaqi Li, Xiaolong Lin, Zhekai Li, Shixi Huang, Yuancheng Wang, Chaoren Wang, Zhenpeng Zhan, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: Neural audio codecs form the foundational building blocks for language model (LM)-based speech generation. Typically, there is a trade-off between frame rate and audio quality. This study introduces a low-frame-rate, semantically enhanced codec model. Existing approaches distill semantically rich self-supervised (SSL) representations into the first-layer codec tokens. This work proposes DualCodec, a dual-stream encoding approach that integrates SSL and waveform representations within an end-to-end codec framework. In this setting, DualCodec enhances the semantic information in the first-layer codec and enables the codec system to maintain high audio quality while operating at a low frame rate. Note that a low-frame-rate codec improves the efficiency of speech generation. Experimental results on audio codec and speech generation tasks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DualCodec compared to state-of-the-art codec systems, such as Mimi Codec, SpeechTokenizer, DAC, and Encodec.

Title: MMAR: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reasoning in Speech, Audio, Music, and Their Mix

Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios, including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers: Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding. Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models (OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models. We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but little-explored area.

Title: Disentangling Coordiante Frames for Task Specific Motion Retargeting in Teleoperation using Shared Control and VR Controllers
Authors: Max Grobbel, Daniel Flögel, Philipp Rigoll, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: Task performance in terms of task completion time in teleoperation is still far behind compared to humans conducting tasks directly. One large identified impact on this is the human capability to perform transformations and alignments, which is directly influenced by the point of view and the motion retargeting strategy. In modern teleoperation systems, motion retargeting is usually implemented through a one time calibration or switching modes. Complex tasks, like concatenated screwing, might be difficult, because the operator has to align (e.g. mirror) rotational and translational input commands. Recent research has shown, that the separation of translation and rotation leads to increased task performance. This work proposes a formal motion retargeting method, which separates translational and rotational input commands. This method is then included in a optimal control based trajectory planner and shown to work on a UR5e manipulator.

Title: Hearing from Silence: Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos via Vision-Language Model
Authors: Yong Ren, Chenxing Li, Le Xu, Hao Gu, Duzhen Zhang, Yujie Chen, Manjie Xu, Ruibo Fu, Shan Yang, Dong Yu
Abstract: Humans can intuitively infer sounds from silent videos, but whether multimodal large language models can perform modal-mismatch reasoning without accessing target modalities remains relatively unexplored. Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.

Title: Suicide Risk Assessment Using Multimodal Speech Features: A Study on the SW1 Challenge Dataset
Authors: Ambre Marie, Ilias Maoudj, Guillaume Dardenne, Gwenolé Quellec
Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX, linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM. Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

Title: MultiActor-Audiobook: Zero-Shot Audiobook Generation with Faces and Voices of Multiple Speakers
Authors: Kyeongman Park, Seongho Joo, Kyomin Jung
Abstract: We introduce MultiActor-Audiobook, a zero-shot approach for generating audiobooks that automatically produces consistent, expressive, and speaker-appropriate prosody, including intonation and emotion. Previous audiobook systems have several limitations: they require users to manually configure the speaker's prosody, read each sentence with a monotonic tone compared to voice actors, or rely on costly training. However, our MultiActor-Audiobook addresses these issues by introducing two novel processes: (1) MSP (**Multimodal Speaker Persona Generation**) and (2) LSI (**LLM-based Script Instruction Generation**). With these two processes, MultiActor-Audiobook can generate more emotionally expressive audiobooks with a consistent speaker prosody without additional training. We compare our system with commercial products, through human and MLLM evaluations, achieving competitive results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP and LSI through ablation studies.

Title: Time-Frequency-Based Attention Cache Memory Model for Real-Time Speech Separation
Authors: Guo Chen, Kai Li, Runxuan Yang, Xiaolin Hu
Abstract: Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM) model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage. In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters.

Title: Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Mixed Graph Algorithms for Traffic Forecast
Authors: Ji Qi, Tam Thuc Do, Mingxiao Liu, Zhuoshi Pan, Yuzhe Li, Gene Cheung, H. Vicky Zhao
Abstract: To forecast traffic with both spatial and temporal dimensions, we unroll a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm into a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net. Specifically, we construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.

Title: Benchmarking and Confidence Evaluation of LALMs For Temporal Reasoning
Authors: Debarpan Bhattacharya, Apoorva Kulkarni, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA). We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus, points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes applications.

Title: Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance for Robotics: Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Racing
Authors: Hao Ma, Sabrina Bodmer, Andrea Carron, Melanie Zeilinger, Michael Muehlebach
Abstract: Diffusion models hold great potential in robotics due to their ability to capture complex, high-dimensional data distributions. However, their lack of constraint-awareness limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance (CoDiG), a data-efficient and general-purpose framework that integrates barrier functions into the denoising process, guiding diffusion sampling toward constraint-satisfying outputs. CoDiG enables constraint satisfaction even with limited training data and generalizes across tasks. We evaluate our framework in the challenging setting of miniature autonomous racing, where real-time obstacle avoidance is essential. Real-world experiments show that CoDiG generates safe outputs efficiently under dynamic conditions, highlighting its potential for broader robotic applications.

Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

Title: Distilling a speech and music encoder with task arithmetic
Authors: Fabian Ritter-Gutierrez, Yi-Cheng Lin, Jui-Chiang Wei, Jeremy H.M Wong, Eng Siong Chng, Nancy F. Chen, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Despite the progress in self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech and music, existing models treat these domains separately, limiting their capacity for unified audio understanding. A unified model is desirable for applications that require general representations, e.g. audio large language models. Nonetheless, directly training a general model for speech and music is computationally expensive. Knowledge Distillation of teacher ensembles may be a natural solution, but we posit that decoupling the distillation of the speech and music SSL models allows for more flexibility. Thus, we propose to learn distilled task vectors and then linearly interpolate them to form a unified speech+music model. This strategy enables flexible domain emphasis through adjustable weights and is also simpler to train. Experiments on speech and music benchmarks demonstrate that our method yields superior overall performance compared to ensemble distillation.

Title: VesselGPT: Autoregressive Modeling of Vascular Geometry
Authors: Paula Feldman, Martin Sinnona, Viviana Siless, Claudio Delrieux, Emmanuel Iarussi
Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous' methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code, data, and trained models will be made available.

Title: Learning Driven Elastic Task Multi-Connectivity Immersive Computing Systems
Authors: Babak Badnava, Jacob Chakareski, Morteza Hashemi
Abstract: In virtual reality (VR) environments, computational tasks exhibit an elastic nature, meaning they can dynamically adjust based on various user and system constraints. This elasticity is essential for maintaining immersive experiences; however, it also introduces challenges for communication and computing in VR systems. In this paper, we investigate elastic task offloading for multi-user edge-computing-enabled VR systems with multi-connectivity, aiming to maximize the computational energy-efficiency (computational throughput per unit of energy consumed). To balance the induced communication, computation, energy consumption, and quality of experience trade-offs due to the elasticity of VR tasks, we formulate a constrained stochastic computational energy-efficiency optimization problem that integrates the multi-connectivity/multi-user action space and the elastic nature of VR computational tasks. We formulate a centralized phasic policy gradient (CPPG) framework to solve the problem of interest online, using only prior elastic task offloading statistics (energy consumption, response time, and transmission time), and task information (i.e., task size and computational intensity), while observing the induced system performance (energy consumption and latency). We further extend our approach to decentralized learning by formulating an independent phasic policy gradient (IPPG) method and a decentralized shared multi-armed bandit (DSMAB) method. We train our methods with real-world 4G, 5G, and WiGig network traces and 360 video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of response time, energy efficiency, scalability, and delivered quality of experience. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of task size and its effect on offloading policy and system performance. In particular, we show that CPPG reduces latency by 28% and energy consumption by 78% compared to IPPG.

Title: Neural-Enhanced Rate Adaptation and Computation Distribution for Emerging mmWave Multi-User 3D Video Streaming Systems
Authors: Babak Badnava, Jacob Chakareski, Morteza Hashemi
Abstract: We investigate multitask edge-user communication-computation resource allocation for $360^\circ$ video streaming in an edge-computing enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user virtual reality system. To balance the communication-computation trade-offs that arise herein, we formulate a video quality maximization problem that integrates interdependent multitask/multi-user action spaces and rebuffering time/quality variation constraints. We formulate a deep reinforcement learning framework for \underline{m}ulti-\underline{t}ask \underline{r}ate adaptation and \underline{c}omputation distribution (MTRC) to solve the problem of interest. Our solution does not rely on a priori knowledge about the environment and uses only prior video streaming statistics (e.g., throughput, decoding time, and transmission delay), and content information, to adjust the assigned video bitrates and computation distribution, as it observes the induced streaming performance online. Moreover, to capture the task interdependence in the environment, we leverage neural network cascades to extend our MTRC method to two novel variants denoted as R1C2 and C1R2. We train all three methods with real-world mmWave network traces and $360^\circ$ video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of expected quality of experience (QoE), viewport peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), rebuffering time, and quality variation. We outperform state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithms, with C1R2 showing best results and achieving $5.21-6.06$ dB PSNR gains, $2.18-2.70$x rebuffering time reduction, and $4.14-4.50$ dB quality variation reduction.

Title: Contextual Paralinguistic Data Creation for Multi-Modal Speech-LLM: Data Condensation and Spoken QA Generation
Authors: Qiongqiong Wang, Hardik B. Sailor, Tianchi Liu, Ai Ti Aw
Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-task and multilingual approaches benefit large models, yet speech processing for low-resource languages remains underexplored due to data scarcity. To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages. This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on previously curated datasets for both high- and low-resource languages. Our findings show that these models achieve similar performance using approx. 50% less data. Dataset will be made available at this https URL

Title: Noise performance of the complex monopulse ratio
Authors: Marco Lanucara
Abstract: The paper provides a characterization of the complex monopulse ratio in terms of autocorrelation and power spectral density of its fluctuations during satellite tracking, taking into account the presence of additive noise on sum and difference channels. The considered spectral structure and statistical distribution of the incoming signal is of interest for satellite missions. In particular it is assumed that the signal available at the monopulse processor after frequency down conversion contains a Gaussian term produced by low pass filtering of a constant envelope modulation, plus a monochromatic component representative of a possible residual carrier. The results can be used for optimizing the design of a monopulse tracking system.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Scheduling in Distributed Networked Control
Authors: Gaoyang Pang, Kang Huang, Daniel E. Quevedo, Branka Vucetic, Yonghui Li, Wanchun Liu
Abstract: We consider a joint uplink and downlink scheduling problem of a fully distributed wireless networked control system (WNCS) with a limited number of frequency channels. Using elements of stochastic systems theory, we derive a sufficient stability condition of the WNCS, which is stated in terms of both the control and communication system parameters. Once the condition is satisfied, there exists a stationary and deterministic scheduling policy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing the per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable vector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework for solving it. To tackle the challenges of a large action space in DRL, we propose novel action space reduction and action embedding methods for the DRL framework that can be applied to various algorithms, including Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark policies.

Title: You Can Wash Hands Better: Accurate Daily Handwashing Assessment with a Smartwatch
Authors: Fei Wang, Tingting Zhang, Xilei Wu, Xin Wang, Pengcheng Wang, Han Ding, Jingang Shi, Jinsong Han, Dong Huang
Abstract: Hand hygiene is among the most effective daily practices for preventing infectious diseases such as influenza, malaria, and skin infections. While professional guidelines emphasize proper handwashing to reduce the risk of viral infections, surveys reveal that adherence to these recommendations remains low. To address this gap, we propose UWash, a wearable solution leveraging smartwatches to evaluate handwashing procedures, aiming to raise awareness and cultivate high-quality handwashing habits. We frame the task of handwashing assessment as an action segmentation problem, similar to those in computer vision, and introduce a simple yet efficient two-stream UNet-like network to achieve this goal. Experiments involving 51 subjects demonstrate that UWash achieves 92.27% accuracy in handwashing gesture recognition, an error of <0.5 seconds in onset/offset detection, and an error of <5 points in gesture scoring under user-dependent settings. The system also performs robustly in user-independent and user-independent-location-independent evaluations. Remarkably, UWash maintains high performance in real-world tests, including evaluations with 10 random passersby at a hospital 9 months later and 10 passersby in an in-the-wild test conducted 2 years later. UWash is the first system to score handwashing quality based on gesture sequences, offering actionable guidance for improving daily hand hygiene.

Title: A Cyclic Small Phase Theorem
Authors: Chao Chen, Wei Chen, Di Zhao, Jianqi Chen, Li Qiu
Abstract: This paper introduces a brand-new phase definition called the segmental phase for multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant systems. The underpinning of the definition lies in the matrix segmental phase which, as its name implies, is graphically based on the smallest circular segment covering the matrix normalized numerical range in the unit disk. The matrix segmental phase has the crucial product eigen-phase bound, which makes itself stand out from several existing phase notions in the literature. The proposed bound paves the way for stability analysis of a single-loop cyclic feedback system consisting of multiple subsystems. A cyclic small phase theorem is then established as our main result, which requires the loop system phase to lie between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. The proposed theorem complements a cyclic version of the celebrated small gain theorem. In addition, a generalization of the proposed theorem is made via the use of angular scaling techniques for reducing conservatism.

Title: BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models
Authors: Zhisheng Zheng, Puyuan Peng, Ziyang Ma, Xie Chen, Eunsol Choi, David Harwath
Abstract: Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.

Title: An Overview of Automated Vehicle Longitudinal Platoon Formation Strategies
Authors: M Sabbir Salek, Mugdha Basu Thakur, Pardha Sai Krishna Ala, Mashrur Chowdhury, Matthias Schmid, Pamela Murray-Tuite, Sakib Mahmud Khan, Venkat Krovi
Abstract: Automated vehicle (AV) platooning has the potential to improve the safety, operational, and energy efficiency of surface transportation systems by limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in AV longitudinal platoon formation using a five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model, information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based on the discussion about existing strategies and associated limitations, potential future research directions are presented.

Title: Economic Capacity Withholding Bounds of Competitive Energy Storage Bidders
Authors: Xin Qin, Ioannis Lestas, Bolun Xu
Abstract: Economic withholding in electricity markets refers to generators bidding higher than their true marginal fuel cost, and is a typical approach to exercising market power. However, existing market designs require storage to design bids strategically based on their own future price predictions, motivating storage to conduct economic withholding without assuming market power. As energy storage takes up more significant roles in wholesale electricity markets, understanding its motivations for economic withholding and the consequent effects on social welfare becomes increasingly vital. This paper derives a theoretical framework to study the economic capacity withholding behavior of storage participating in competitive electricity markets and validate our results in simulations based on the ISO New England system. We demonstrate that storage bids can reach unbounded high levels under conditions where future price predictions show bounded expectations but unbounded deviations. Conversely, in scenarios with peak price limitations, we show the upper bounds of storage bids are grounded in bounded price expectations. Most importantly, we show that storage capacity withholding can potentially lower the overall system cost when price models account for system uncertainties. Our paper reveals energy storage is not a market manipulator but an honest player contributing to the social welfare. It helps electricity market researchers and operators better understand the economic withholding behavior of storage and reform market policies to maximize storage contributing to a cost-efficient decolonization.

Title: Matrix-Valued Measures and Wishart Statistics for Target Tracking Applications
Authors: Robin Forsling, Simon J. Julier, Gustaf Hendeby
Abstract: Ensuring sufficiently accurate models is crucial in target tracking systems. If the assumed models deviate too much from the truth, the tracking performance might be severely degraded. While the models are usually defined using multivariate conditions, the measures used to validate them are most often scalar-valued. In this paper, we propose matrix-valued measures for both offline and online assessment of target tracking systems. Recent results from Wishart statistics, and approximations thereof, are adapted and it is shown how these can be incorporated to infer statistical properties for the eigenvalues of the proposed measures. In addition, we relate these results to the statistics of the baseline measures. Finally, the applicability of the proposed measures are demonstrated using two important problems in target tracking: (i) distributed track fusion design; and (ii) filter model mismatch detection.

Title: Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized F-RANs
Authors: Xingran Chen, Kai Li, Kun Yang
Abstract: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.

Title: Multi-modal MRI Translation via Evidential Regression and Distribution Calibration
Authors: Jiyao Liu, Shangqi Gao, Yuxin Li, Lihao Liu, Xin Gao, Zhaohu Xing, Junzhi Ning, Yanzhou Su, Xiao-Yong Zhang, Junjun He, Ningsheng Xu, Xiahai Zhuang
Abstract: Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation leverages information from source MRI sequences to generate target modalities, enabling comprehensive diagnosis while overcoming the limitations of acquiring all sequences. While existing deep-learning-based multi-modal MRI translation methods have shown promising potential, they still face two key challenges: 1) lack of reliable uncertainty quantification for synthesized images, and 2) limited robustness when deployed across different medical centers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that reformulates multi-modal MRI translation as a multi-modal evidential regression problem with distribution calibration. Our approach incorporates two key components: 1) an evidential regression module that estimates uncertainties from different source modalities and an explicit distribution mixture strategy for transparent multi-modal fusion, and 2) a distribution calibration mechanism that adapts to source-target mapping shifts to ensure consistent performance across different medical centers. Extensive experiments on three datasets from the BraTS2023 challenge demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance and robustness across domains.

Title: Safety Critical Control for Nonlinear Systems with Complex Input Constraints
Authors: Yaosheng Deng, Yang Bai, Yujie Wang, Masaki Ogura, Mir Feroskhan
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF) based controller for nonlinear systems with complex, time-varying input constraints. To deal with these constraints, we introduce an auxiliary control input to transform the original system into an augmented one, thus reformulating the constrained-input problem into a constrained-output one. This transformation simplifies the Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation and enhances compatibility with the CBF framework. As a result, the proposed method can systematically address the complex, time-varying, and state-dependent input constraints. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated using numerical examples.

Title: Toward Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum AD/DA Conversion and the Fourier Transform
Authors: Yuan Liu, John M. Martyn, Jasmine Sinanan-Singh, Kevin C. Smith, Steven M. Girvin, Isaac L. Chuang
Abstract: Signal processing stands as a pillar of classical computation and modern information technology, applicable to both analog and digital signals. Recently, advancements in quantum information science have suggested that quantum signal processing (QSP) can enable more powerful signal processing capabilities. However, the developments in QSP have primarily leveraged \emph{digital} quantum resources, such as discrete-variable (DV) systems like qubits, rather than \emph{analog} quantum resources, such as continuous-variable (CV) systems like quantum oscillators. Consequently, there remains a gap in understanding how signal processing can be performed on hybrid CV-DV quantum computers. Here we address this gap by developing a new paradigm of mixed analog-digital QSP. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm by showcasing how it naturally enables analog-digital conversion of quantum signals -- specifically, the transfer of states between DV and CV quantum systems. We then show that such quantum analog-digital conversion enables new implementations of quantum algorithms on CV-DV hardware. This is exemplified by realizing the quantum Fourier transform of a state encoded on qubits via the free-evolution of a quantum oscillator, albeit with a runtime exponential in the number of qubits due to information theoretic arguments. Collectively, this work marks a significant step forward in hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, providing a foundation for scalable analog-digital signal processing on quantum processors.

Title: USEF-TSE: Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Bang Zeng, Ming Li
Abstract: Target speaker extraction aims to separate the voice of a specific speaker from mixed speech. Traditionally, this process has relied on extracting a speaker embedding from a reference speech, in which a speaker recognition model is required. However, identifying an appropriate speaker recognition model can be challenging, and using the target speaker embedding as reference information may not be optimal for target speaker extraction tasks. This paper introduces a Universal Speaker Embedding-Free Target Speaker Extraction (USEF-TSE) framework that operates without relying on speaker embeddings. USEF-TSE utilizes a multi-head cross-attention mechanism as a frame-level target speaker feature extractor. This innovative approach allows mainstream speaker extraction solutions to bypass the dependency on speaker recognition models and better leverage the information available in the enrollment speech, including speaker characteristics and contextual details. Additionally, USEF-TSE can seamlessly integrate with other time-domain or time-frequency domain speech separation models to achieve effective speaker extraction. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) on the WSJ0-2mix, WHAM!, and WHAMR! datasets, which are standard benchmarks for monaural anechoic, noisy and noisy-reverberant two-speaker speech separation and speaker extraction. The results on the LibriMix and the blind test set of the ICASSP 2023 DNS Challenge demonstrate that the model performs well on more diverse and out-of-domain data.

Title: ECVC: Exploiting Non-Local Correlations in Multiple Frames for Contextual Video Compression
Authors: Wei Jiang, Junru Li, Kai Zhang, Li Zhang
Abstract: In Learned Video Compression (LVC), improving inter prediction, such as enhancing temporal context mining and mitigating accumulated errors, is crucial for boosting rate-distortion performance. Existing LVCs mainly focus on mining the temporal movements while neglecting non-local correlations among frames. Additionally, current contextual video compression models use a single reference frame, which is insufficient for handling complex movements. To address these issues, we propose leveraging non-local correlations across multiple frames to enhance temporal priors, significantly boosting rate-distortion performance. To mitigate error accumulation, we introduce a partial cascaded fine-tuning strategy that supports fine-tuning on full-length sequences with constrained computational resources. This method reduces the train-test mismatch in sequence lengths and significantly decreases accumulated errors. Based on the proposed techniques, we present a video compression scheme ECVC. Experiments demonstrate that our ECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing 10.5% and 11.5% more bit-rates than previous SOTA method DCVC-FM over VTM-13.2 low delay B (LDB) under the intra period (IP) of 32 and -1, respectively.

Title: Modeling Nonlinear Oscillator Networks Using Physics-Informed Hybrid Reservoir Computing
Authors: Andrew Shannon, Conor Houghton, David Barton, Martin Homer
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of non-linear oscillator networks remains challenging due to discrepancies between simplified analytical models and real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we investigate hybrid reservoir computing, combining reservoir computing with "expert" analytical models. Simulating the absence of an exact model, we first test the surrogate models with parameter errors in their expert model. Second, in a residual physics task, we assess their performance when their expert model lacks key non-linear coupling terms present in an extended ground-truth model. We focus on short-term forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes, evaluating the use of these surrogates for control applications. We show that hybrid reservoir computers generally outperform standard reservoir computers and exhibit greater robustness to parameter tuning. This advantage is less pronounced in the residual physics task. Notably, unlike standard reservoir computers, the performance of the hybrid does not degrade when crossing an observed spectral radius threshold. Furthermore, there is good performance for dynamical regimes not accessible to the expert model, demonstrating the contribution of the reservoir.

Title: Performance Benchmarking of Psychomotor Skills Using Wearable Devices: An Application in Sport
Authors: Mahela Pandukabhaya, Tharaka Fonseka, Madhumini Kulathunge, Roshan Godaliyadda, Parakrama Ekanayake, Chanaka Senanayake, Vijitha Herath
Abstract: Mastering psychomotor skills, such as those essential in sports, rehabilitation, and professional training, often requires a precise understanding of motion patterns and performance metrics. This study proposes a versatile framework for optimizing psychomotor learning through human motion analysis. Utilizing a wearable IMU sensor system, the motion trajectories of a given psychomotor task are acquired and then linked to points in a performance space using a predefined set of quality metrics specific to the psychomotor skill. This enables the identification of a benchmark cluster in the performance space, which represents a group of reference points that define optimal performance across multiple criteria, allowing correspondences to be established between the performance clusters and sets of trajectories in the motion space. As a result, common or specific deviations in the performance space can be identified, enabling remedial actions in the motion space to optimize performance. A thorough validation of the proposed framework is done in this paper using a Table Tennis forehand stroke as a case study. The resulting quantitative and visual representation of performance empowers individuals to optimize their skills and achieve peak performance.

Title: Unsupervised Multi-Parameter Inverse Solving for Reducing Ring Artifacts in 3D X-Ray CBCT
Authors: Qing Wu, Hongjiang Wei, Jingyi Yu, Yuyao Zhang
Abstract: Ring artifacts are prevalent in 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) due to non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors, substantially affecting image quality and diagnostic reliability. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) ring artifact reduction (RAR) methods rely on supervised learning with large-scale paired CT datasets. While effective in-domain, supervised methods tend to struggle to fully capture the physical characteristics of ring artifacts, leading to pronounced performance drops in complex real-world acquisitions. Moreover, their scalability to 3D CBCT is limited by high memory demands. In this work, we propose Riner, a new unsupervised RAR method. Based on a theoretical analysis of ring artifact formation, we reformulate RAR as a multi-parameter inverse problem, where the non-ideal responses of X-ray detectors are parameterized as solvable physical variables. Using a new differentiable forward model, Riner can jointly learn the implicit neural representation of artifact-free images and estimate the physical parameters directly from CT measurements, without external training data. Additionally, Riner is memory-friendly due to its ray-based optimization, enhancing its usability in large-scale 3D CBCT. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show Riner outperforms existing SOTA supervised methods.

Title: Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction and Personal Voice Activity Detection
Authors: Bang Zeng, Ming Li
Abstract: Determining 'who spoke what and when' remains challenging in real-world applications. In typical scenarios, Speaker Diarization (SD) is employed to address the problem of 'who spoke when,' while Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) or Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (TSASR) techniques are utilized to resolve the issue of 'who spoke what.' Although some works have achieved promising results by combining SD and TSE systems, inconsistencies remain between SD and TSE regarding both output inconsistency and scenario mismatch. To address these limitations, we propose a Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction and Personal Voice Activity Detection (USEF-TP) model that jointly performs TSE and Personal Voice Activity Detection (PVAD). USEF-TP leverages frame-level features obtained through a cross-attention mechanism as speaker-related features instead of using speaker embeddings as in traditional approaches. Additionally, a multi-task learning algorithm with a scenario-aware differentiated loss function is applied to ensure robust performance across various levels of speaker overlap. The experimental results show that our proposed USEF-TP model achieves superior performance in TSE and PVAD tasks on the LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. The results on the CALLHOME dataset demonstrate the competitive performance of our model on real recordings.

Title: Near-Field ISAC: Synergy of Dual-Purpose Codebooks and Space-Time Adaptive Processing
Authors: Ahmed Hussain, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, enabling situationally aware and perceptive next-generation wireless networks through the co-design of shared network resources. With the adoption of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands, ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems and holographic surfaces unlock the potential of near-field (NF) propagation, characterized by spherical wavefronts that facilitate beam manipulation in both angular and range domains. This paper presents a unified approach to near-field beam-training and sensing, introducing a dual-purpose codebook design that employs discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based codebooks for coarse estimation of sensing parameters and polar codebooks for parameter refinement. Leveraging these range and angle estimates, a customized low-complexity space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique is proposed for NF-ISAC to detect slow-moving targets and efficiently mitigate clutter. The interplay between codebooks and NF-STAP framework offers three key advantages: reduced communication beam training overhead, improved estimation accuracy, and minimal STAP computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce STAP complexity by three orders of magnitude, validating efficacy, and highlighting the potential of the proposed approach to seamlessly integrate NF communication and sensing functionalities in future wireless networks.

Title: STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting
Authors: Bonan An, Weidong Mei, Yuanwei Liu, Dong Wang, Zhi Chen
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.

Abstract: This study contributes to the advancement of vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit (AGT) systems using Wi-Fi probe requests and deep learning models. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating various approaches to occupancy estimation, particularly in the context of MAC address randomization. While many methods proposed in the literature claim effectiveness in simpler experimental settings, our research reveals that those methods are unreliable in the complex environment of AGT systems. Specifically, techniques for handling randomized MAC addresses and distinguishing between passenger and non-passenger data do not perform well in AGT systems. Despite challenges in tracking individual devices, our study demonstrates that accurate occupancy estimation using Wi-Fi probe requests remains feasible. A pilot study conducted on the Miami-Dade Metromover, an AGT system characterized by frequent stops, significant occupancy fluctuations, and absence of fare collection devices, provides a robust testing ground for the framework. Additionally, our findings show that deep learning models significantly outperform machine learning models in this context. The insights from this study can significantly enhance decision-making for transit agencies to optimize operations and elevate service quality.

Title: Decoding Human Attentive States from Spatial-temporal EEG Patches Using Transformers
Authors: Yi Ding, Joon Hei Lee, Shuailei Zhang, Tianze Luo, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Learning the spatial topology of electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and their temporal dynamics is crucial for decoding attention states. This paper introduces EEG-PatchFormer, a transformer-based deep learning framework designed specifically for EEG attention classification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. By integrating a Temporal CNN for frequency-based EEG feature extraction, a pointwise CNN for feature enhancement, and Spatial and Temporal Patching modules for organizing features into spatial-temporal patches, EEG-PatchFormer jointly learns spatial-temporal information from EEG data. Leveraging the global learning capabilities of the self-attention mechanism, it captures essential features across brain regions over time, thereby enhancing EEG data decoding performance. Demonstrating superior performance, EEG-PatchFormer surpasses existing benchmarks in accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and macro-F1 score on a public cognitive attention dataset.

Title: State-Dependent Conformal Perception Bounds for Neuro-Symbolic Verification of Autonomous Systems
Authors: Thomas Waite, Yuang Geng, Trevor Turnquist, Ivan Ruchkin, Radoslav Ivanov
Abstract: It remains a challenge to provide safety guarantees for autonomous systems with neural perception and control. A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.

Title: Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for State Avoidance in Discrete Event Systems
Authors: Md Nur-A-Adam Dony
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a potent paradigm for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. However, the integration of event-driven decision processes within RL remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel architecture that combines a Discrete Event Supervisory (DES) model with a standard RL framework to create a hybrid decision-making system. Our model leverages the DES's capabilities in managing event-based dynamics with the RL agent's adaptability to continuous states and actions, facilitating a more robust and flexible control strategy in systems characterized by both continuous and discrete events. The DES model operates alongside the RL agent, enhancing the policy's performance with event-based insights, while the environment's state transitions are governed by a mechanistic model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations that show improved performance metrics over traditional RL implementations. Our results suggest that this integrated approach holds promise for applications ranging from industrial automation to intelligent traffic systems, where discrete event handling is paramount.

Title: Electrifying Heavy-Duty Trucks: Battery-Swapping vs Fast Charging
Authors: Ruiting Wang, Antoine Martinez, Zaid Allybokus, Wente Zeng, Nicolas Obrecht, Scott Moura
Abstract: The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify their optimal design. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.

Title: Submillimeter-Accurate 3D Lumbar Spine Reconstruction from Biplanar X-Ray Images: Incorporating a Multi-Task Network and Landmark-Weighted Loss
Authors: Wanxin Yu, Zhemin Zhu, Cong Wang, Yihang Bao, Chunjie Xia, Rongshan Cheng, Yan Yu, Tsung-Yuan Tsai
Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of the spine under weight-bearing conditions from biplanar X-ray images is of great importance for the clinical assessment of spinal diseases. However, the current fully automated reconstruction methods only achieve millimeter-level accuracy, making it difficult to meet clinical standards. This study developed and validated a fully automated method for high-accuracy 3D reconstruction of the lumbar spine from biplanar X-ray images. The method involves lumbar decomposition and landmark detection from the raw X-ray images, followed by a deformable model and landmark-weighted 2D-3D registration approach. The reconstruction accuracy was validated by the gold standard obtained through the registration of CT-segmented vertebral models with the biplanar X-ray images. The proposed method achieved a 3D reconstruction accuracy of 0.80mm, representing a significant improvement over the mainstream approaches. This study will contribute to the clinical diagnosis of lumbar in weight-bearing positions.

Title: System Identification Under Bounded Noise: Optimal Rates Beyond Least Squares
Authors: Xiong Zeng, Jing Yu, Necmiye Ozay
Abstract: System identification is a fundamental problem in control and learning, particularly in high-stakes applications where data efficiency is critical. Classical approaches, such as the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate under Gaussian noise assumptions, where $T$ is the number of samples. This rate has been shown to match the lower bound. However, in many practical scenarios, noise is known to be bounded, opening the possibility of improving sample complexity. In this work, we establish the minimax lower bound for system identification under bounded noise, proving that the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate is indeed optimal. We further demonstrate that OLS remains limited to an $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, making it fundamentally suboptimal in the presence of bounded noise. Finally, we instantiate two natural variations of OLS that obtain the optimal sample complexity.

Title: High Accuracy Pulmonary Vessel Segmentation for Contrast and Non-contrast CT Images and Clinical Evaluation
Authors: Ying Ming (1), Shaoze Luo (2), Longfei Zhao (2), Ruijie Zhao (1), Bing Li (2), Qiqi Xu (2), Wei Song (1) ((1) Department of Radiology Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, (2) Research and Development Center Canon Medical Systems China)
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pulmonary vessels plays a very critical role in diagnosing and assessing various lung diseases. Currently, many automated algorithms are primarily targeted at CTPA (Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography) types of data. However, the segmentation precision of these methods is insufficient, and support for NCCT (Non-Contrast Computed Tomography) types of data is also a requirement in some clinical scenarios. In this study, we propose a 3D image segmentation algorithm for automated pulmonary vessel segmentation from both contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CT images. In the network, we designed a Vessel Lumen Structure Optimization Module (VLSOM), which extracts the centerline (Cl) of vessels and adjusts the weights based on the positional information and adds a Cl-Dice Loss to supervise the stability of the vessels structure. We used 427 sets of high-precision annotated CT data from multiple vendors and countries to train the model and achieved Cl-DICE, Cl-Recall, and Recall values of 0.892, 0.861, 0.924 for CTPA data and 0.925, 0.903, 0.949 for NCCT data. This shows that our model has achieved good performance in both accuracy and completeness of pulmonary vessel segmentation. We finally conducted a clinical visual assessment on an independent external test dataset. The average score for accuracy and robustness, branch abundance, assistance for diagnosis and vascular continuity are 4.26, 4.17, 4.33, 3.83 respectively while the full score is 5. These results highlight the great potential of this method in clinical application.

Title: CP-NCBF: A Conformal Prediction-based Approach to Synthesize Verified Neural Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Manan Tayal, Aditya Singh, Pushpak Jagtap, Shishir Kolathaya
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a practical approach for designing safety-critical controllers, but constructing them for arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenge. Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.

Title: Algorithm Design and Prototype Validation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surface: Forward-Only Transmission
Authors: Cheng Luo, Luping Xiang, Jie Hu, Kun Yang
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.

Title: Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems
Authors: Sunjung Kang, Vishrant Tripathi, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.

Title: Adaptive Control of Dubins Vehicle in the Presence of Loss of Effectiveness (Extended Version)
Authors: Daniel Maldonado Naranjo, Anuradha M. Annaswamy
Abstract: The control of a Dubins Vehicle when subjected to a loss of control effectiveness in the turning rate is considered. A complex state-space representation is used to model the vehicle dynamics. An adaptive control design is proposed, with the underlying stability analysis guaranteeing closed-loop boundedness and tracking of a desired path. It is shown that a path constructed by waypoints and a minimum turn radius can be specified using a reference model which can be followed by the closed loop system. The control design utilizes the complex representation as well as a PID controller for the nominal closed-loop. How the design can be modified to ensure to ensure path following even in the presence input constraints is also discussed. Simulation studies are carried out to complement the theoretical derivations.

Title: ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior
Authors: Zhongweiyang Xu, Xulin Fan, Zhong-Qiu Wang, Xilin Jiang, Romit Roy Choudhury
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: this https URL.

Title: Leveraging Reinforcement Learning and Koopman Theory for Enhanced Model Predictive Control Performance
Authors: Md Nur-A-Adam Dony
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to Model Predictive Control (MPC) by leveraging the powerful combination of Koopman theory and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). By transforming nonlinear dynamical systems into a higher-dimensional linear regime, the Koopman operator facilitates the linear treatment of nonlinear behaviors, paving the way for more efficient control strategies. Our methodology harnesses the predictive prowess of Koopman-based models alongside the optimization capabilities of DRL, particularly using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to enhance the controller's performance. The resulting end-to-end learning framework refines the predictive control policies to cater to specific operational tasks, optimizing both performance and economic efficiency. We validate our approach through rigorous NMPC and eNMPC case studies, demonstrating that the Koopman-RL controller outperforms traditional controllers by achieving higher stability, superior constraint satisfaction, and significant cost savings. The findings indicate that our model can be a robust tool for complex control tasks, offering valuable insights into future applications of RL in MPC.

Title: Integrating Koopman theory and Lyapunov stability for enhanced model predictive control in nonlinear systems
Authors: Md Nur-A-Adam Dony
Abstract: This paper delves into the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of modern control systems, specifically focusing on bilinear systems, a prevalent subclass of non-linear systems characterized by state dynamics influenced by the interaction of state and control variables. Traditional control strategies, such as PID controllers, often fall short in adequately addressing the intricacies of such systems due to their predictive limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Model Predictive Control (MPC), a sophisticated technique that utilizes system models to forecast future behaviors, allowing for the computation of an optimal control sequence by minimizing deviations and control efforts. The Koopman operator emerges as a pivotal tool in this framework by providing a means to linearize the nonlinear dynamics of bilinear systems. By integrating the principles of Lyapunov theory with the linearizing capabilities of the Koopman operator into the MPC framework, we give rise to Koopman Lyapunov-based Model Predictive Control (Koopman LMPC). This approach not only retains MPC's predictive capabilities but also harnesses the Koopman operator's ability to transform complex nonlinear behaviors into a linear framework, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of LMPC. With the stability assurances from Lyapunov theory, Koopman LMPC presents a robust solution to effectively control and stabilize bilinear systems. The paper underscores the efficacy of Koopman LMPC, emphasizing its significance in achieving optimal performance and system stability, marking it as a promising approach for the future of advanced control systems.

Title: Non-Blocking Robustness Analysis in Discrete Event Systems
Authors: Md Nur-A-Adam Dony
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for characterizing state blocking in discrete event systems (DES) under transition deletions. We introduce a path-based analysis approach that determines whether systems maintain non-blocking properties when transitions are removed. Through formal analysis and case studies, we establish three key contributions: a mathematical characterization of transition-induced blocking with necessary and sufficient conditions, a definition of robust deviations that preserve non-blocking properties, and an algorithm for identifying critical transitions and analyzing system behavior under deletions. Our algorithm reduces computational complexity by leveraging minimal blocking sets, achieving significant reduction in computational requirements. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through manufacturing system and autonomous vehicle case studies, showing substantial improvements in identifying critical transitions and predicting potential blocking scenarios across different application domains.

Title: Ultrasound Report Generation with Multimodal Large Language Models for Standardized Texts
Authors: Peixuan Ge, Tongkun Su, Faqin Lv, Baoliang Zhao, Peng Zhang, Chi Hong Wong, Liang Yao, Yu Sun, Zenan Wang, Pak Kin Wong, Ying Hu
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) report generation is a challenging task due to the variability of US images, operator dependence, and the need for standardized text. Unlike X-ray and CT, US imaging lacks consistent datasets, making automation difficult. In this study, we propose a unified framework for multi-organ and multilingual US report generation, integrating fragment-based multilingual training and leveraging the standardized nature of US reports. By aligning modular text fragments with diverse imaging data and curating a bilingual English-Chinese dataset, the method achieves consistent and clinically accurate text generation across organ sites and languages. Fine-tuning with selective unfreezing of the vision transformer (ViT) further improves text-image alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art KMVE method, our approach achieves relative gains of about 2\% in BLEU scores, approximately 3\% in ROUGE-L, and about 15\% in CIDEr, while significantly reducing errors such as missing or incorrect content. By unifying multi-organ and multi-language report generation into a single, scalable framework, this work demonstrates strong potential for real-world clinical workflows.

Title: Stability and Convergence Analysis of Multi-Agent Consensus with Communication Delays: A Lambert W Function Approach
Authors: Layan Badran, Kiarash Aryankia, Rastko R. Selmic
Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of constant time delay in weakly connected multi-agent systems modeled by double integrator dynamics. A novel analytical approach is proposed to establish an upper bound on the permissible time delay that ensures stability and consensus convergence. The analysis employs the Lambert W function method in higher-dimensional systems to derive explicit conditions under which consensus is achieved. The theoretical results are rigorously proven and provide insight into the allowable delay margins. The analysis applies to general leaderless undirected network topologies. The framework also accounts for complex and realistic delays, including non-commensurate communication delays. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Robust Path Recommendations During Public Transit Disruptions Under Demand Uncertainty
Authors: Baichuan Mo, Haris N. Koutsopoulos, Max Zuo-Jun Shen, Jinhua Zhao
Abstract: When there are significant service disruptions in public transit systems, passengers usually need guidance to find alternative paths. This paper proposes a path recommendation model to mitigate congestion during public transit disruptions. Passengers with different origins, destinations, and departure times are recommended with different paths such that the system travel time is minimized. We model the path recommendation problem as an optimal flow problem with uncertain demand information. To tackle the lack of analytical formulation of travel times due to capacity constraints, we propose a simulation-based first-order approximation to transform the original problem into a linear program. Uncertainties in demand are modeled using robust optimization to protect the path recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates. A real-world rail disruption scenario in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system is used as a case study. Results show that even without considering uncertainty, the nominal model can reduce the system travel time by 9.1% (compared to the status quo), and outperforms the benchmark capacity-based path recommendation. The average travel time of passengers in the incident line (i.e., passengers receiving recommendations) is reduced more (-20.6% compared to the status quo). After incorporating the demand uncertainty, the robust model can further reduce system travel times. The best robust model can decrease the average travel time of incident-line passengers by 2.91% compared to the nominal model. The improvement of robust models is more prominent when the actual demand pattern is close to the worst-case demand.

Title: Learning The Likelihood Test With One-Class Classifiers for Physical Layer Authentication
Authors: Francesco Ardizzon, Stefano Tomasin
Abstract: In physical layer authentication (PLA) mechanisms, a verifier decides whether a received message has been transmitted by a legitimate user or an intruder, according to some features of the physical channel over which the message traveled. To design the authentication check implemented at the verifier, typically either the statistics or a dataset of features are available for the channel from the legitimate user, while no information is available when under attack. When the statistics are known, a well-known good solution is the likelihood test (LT). When a dataset is available, the decision problem is one-class classification (OCC) and a good understanding of the machine learning (ML) techniques used for its solution is important to ensure security. Thus, in this paper, we aim at obtaining ML PLA verifiers that operate as the LT. We show how to do it with the neural network (NN) and the one-class least-squares support vector machine (OCLSSVM) models, trained as two-class classifiers on the single-class dataset and an artificial dataset. The artificial dataset for the negative class is obtained by generating channel feature (CF) vectors uniformly distributed over the domain of the legitimate class dataset. We also derive a modified stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that trains a PLA verifier operating as LT without the need for the artificial dataset. Furthermore, we show that the one-class least-squares support vector machine with suitable kernels operates as the LT at convergence. Lastly, we show that the widely used autoencoder classifier generally does not provide the LT. Numerical results are provided considering PLA on both wireless and underwater acoustic channels.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Control of Evolutionary and Ecological Processes
Authors: Bryce Allen Bagley, Navin Khoshnan, Claudia K Petritsch
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.

Title: EMelodyGen: Emotion-Conditioned Melody Generation in ABC Notation with the Musical Feature Template
Authors: Monan Zhou, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Wei Li
Abstract: The EMelodyGen system focuses on emotional melody generation in ABC notation controlled by the musical feature template. Owing to the scarcity of well-structured and emotionally labeled sheet music, we designed a template for controlling emotional melody generation by statistical correlations between musical features and emotion labels derived from small-scale emotional symbolic music datasets and music psychology conclusions. We then automatically annotated a large, well-structured sheet music collection with rough emotional labels by the template, converted them into ABC notation, and reduced label imbalance by data augmentation, resulting in a dataset named Rough4Q. Our system backbone pre-trained on Rough4Q can achieve up to 99% music21 parsing rate and melodies generated by our template can lead to a 91% alignment on emotional expressions in blind listening tests. Ablation studies further validated the effectiveness of the feature controls in the template. Available code and demos are at this https URL.

Title: Offboard Occupancy Refinement with Hybrid Propagation for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Hao Shi, Song Wang, Jiaming Zhang, Xiaoting Yin, Guangming Wang, Jianke Zhu, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Vision-based occupancy prediction, also known as 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, particularly for increasing the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner significantly boosts the performance of vision-based SSC models, achieving accuracy levels competitive with established LiDAR-based onboard SSC methods. Furthermore, OccFiner is the first to achieve automatic annotation of SSC in a purely vision-based approach. Quantitative experiments prove that OccFiner successfully facilitates occupancy data loop-closure in autonomous driving. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of the offboard approach on city-level SSC static maps. The source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Shicong Liu, Xianghao Yu, Zhen Gao, Jie Xu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Shuguang Cui
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 66%.

Title: Carbon Footprint Reduction for Sustainable Data Centers in Real-Time
Authors: Soumyendu Sarkar, Avisek Naug, Ricardo Luna, Antonio Guillen, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Sajad Mousavi, Dejan Markovikj, Ashwin Ramesh Babu
Abstract: As machine learning workloads significantly increase energy consumption, sustainable data centers with low carbon emissions are becoming a top priority for governments and corporations worldwide. This requires a paradigm shift in optimizing power consumption in cooling and IT loads, shifting flexible loads based on the availability of renewable energy in the power grid, and leveraging battery storage from the uninterrupted power supply in data centers, using collaborative agents. The complex association between these optimization strategies and their dependencies on variable external factors like weather and the power grid carbon intensity makes this a hard problem. Currently, a real-time controller to optimize all these goals simultaneously in a dynamic real-world setting is lacking. We propose a Data Center Carbon Footprint Reduction (DC-CFR) multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that optimizes data centers for the multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. The results show that the DC-CFR MARL agents effectively resolved the complex interdependencies in optimizing cooling, load shifting, and energy storage in real-time for various locations under real-world dynamic weather and grid carbon intensity conditions. DC-CFR significantly outperformed the industry standard ASHRAE controller with a considerable reduction in carbon emissions (14.5%), energy usage (14.4%), and energy cost (13.7%) when evaluated over one year across multiple geographical regions.

Title: Nonlinear integral extension of PID control with improved convergence of perturbed second-order dynamic systems
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Abstract: Nonlinear extension of the integral part of a standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback control is proposed for perturbed second-order systems. The approach is model-free and requires solely the Lipschitz boundedness of the unknown matched perturbations. For constant disturbances, the global asymptotic stability is shown based on the circle criterion. For Lipschitz perturbations, an ultimately bounded output error is provided based on the steady-state behavior in frequency domain. Also the transient response to the stepwise disturbances is analyzed for the control tuning. Based on the developed analysis, the design recommendations are formulated as a step by step procedure. It is also discussed how the proposed control is applicable to second-order systems extended by additional (parasitic) actuator dynamics with low-pass characteristics. The proposed nonlinear control is proven to outperform its linear PID counterpart during the settling phase, i.e. at convergence of the residual output error. An experimental case study of the second-order system with an additional actuator dynamics and considerable perturbations is demonstrated to confirm and benchmark the control performance.

Authors: Qingkun Deng, Saturnino Luz, Sofia de la Fuente Garcia
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection tools could aid early screening. Here, we propose an interpretable speech foundation model approach to enhance the clinical applicability of such tools. We introduce a speech-level Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to detect depression using long-duration speech instead of short segments, along with a novel interpretation method that reveals prediction-relevant acoustic features for clinician interpretation. Our experiments show the proposed model outperforms a segment-level AST, highlighting the impact of segment-level labelling noise and the advantage of leveraging longer speech duration for more reliable depression detection. Through interpretation, we observe our model identifies reduced loudness and F0 as relevant depression signals, aligning with documented clinical findings. This interpretability supports a responsible AI approach for speech-based depression detection, rendering such tools more clinically applicable.

Title: Two-Player Zero-Sum Hybrid Games
Authors: Santiago J. Leudo, Ricardo G. Sanfelice
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a two-player zero-sum game under dynamic constraints defined by hybrid dynamical equations. The game consists of a min-max problem involving a cost functional that depends on the actions and resulting solutions to the hybrid system, defined as functions of hybrid time and, hence, can flow or jump. A terminal set conveniently defined allows to recast both finite and infinite horizon problems. We present sufficient conditions given in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-like equations to guarantee to attain a solution to the game. It is shown that when the players select the optimal strategy, the value function can be evaluated without computing solutions to the hybrid system. Under additional conditions, we show that the optimal state-feedback laws render a set of interest asymptotically stable for the resulting hybrid closed-loop system. Applications of these games, presented here as robust control problems, include disturbance rejection and security problems.

Title: Audio xLSTMs: Learning Self-Supervised Audio Representations with xLSTMs
Authors: Sarthak Yadav, Sergios Theodoridis, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: While the transformer has emerged as the eminent neural architecture, several independent lines of research have emerged to address its limitations. Recurrent neural approaches have observed a lot of renewed interest, including the extended long short-term memory (xLSTM) architecture, which reinvigorates the original LSTM. However, while xLSTMs have shown competitive performance compared to the transformer, their viability for learning self-supervised general-purpose audio representations has not been evaluated. This work proposes Audio xLSTM (AxLSTM), an approach for learning audio representations from masked spectrogram patches in a self-supervised setting. Pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AxLSTM models outperform comparable self-supervised audio spectrogram transformer (SSAST) baselines by up to 25% in relative performance across a set of ten diverse downstream tasks while having up to 45% fewer parameters.

Title: SSR: Alignment-Aware Modality Connector for Speech Language Models
Authors: Weiting Tan, Hirofumi Inaguma, Ning Dong, Paden Tomasello, Xutai Ma
Abstract: Fusing speech into pre-trained language model (SpeechLM) usually suffers from inefficient encoding of long-form speech and catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained text modality. We propose SSR-Connector (Segmented Speech Representation Connector) for better modality fusion. Leveraging speech-text alignments, our approach segments and compresses speech features to match the granularity of text embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline that includes the distillation and fine-tuning phases to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. SSR-Connector outperforms existing mechanism for speech-text modality fusion, consistently achieving better speech understanding (e.g., +10 accuracy on StoryCloze and +20 on Speech-MMLU) while preserving pre-trained text ability.

Title: Characterization of input-to-output stability for infinite-dimensional systems
Authors: Patrick Bachmann, Sergey Dashkovskiy, Andrii Mironchenko
Abstract: We prove a superposition theorem for input-to-output stability (IOS) of a broad class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems with outputs including both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations known from the literature. To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite-dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output Lagrange stability (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from the literature to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.

Title: BrainECHO: Semantic Brain Signal Decoding through Vector-Quantized Spectrogram Reconstruction for Whisper-Enhanced Text Generation
Authors: Jilong Li, Zhenxi Song, Jiaqi Wang, Meishan Zhang, Honghai Liu, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang
Abstract: Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.

Title: USpeech: Ultrasound-Enhanced Speech with Minimal Human Effort via Cross-Modal Synthesis
Authors: Luca Jiang-Tao Yu, Running Zhao, Sijie Ji, Edith C.H. Ngai, Chenshu Wu
Abstract: Speech enhancement is crucial for ubiquitous human-computer interaction. Recently, ultrasound-based acoustic sensing has emerged as an attractive choice for speech enhancement because of its superior ubiquity and performance. However, due to inevitable interference from unexpected and unintended sources during audio-ultrasound data acquisition, existing solutions rely heavily on human effort for data collection and processing. This leads to significant data scarcity that limits the full potential of ultrasound-based speech enhancement. To address this, we propose USpeech, a cross-modal ultrasound synthesis framework for speech enhancement with minimal human effort. At its core is a two-stage framework that establishes the correspondence between visual and ultrasonic modalities by leveraging audio as a bridge. This approach overcomes challenges from the lack of paired video-ultrasound datasets and the inherent heterogeneity between video and ultrasound data. Our framework incorporates contrastive video-audio pre-training to project modalities into a shared semantic space and employs an audio-ultrasound encoder-decoder for ultrasound synthesis. We then present a speech enhancement network that enhances speech in the time-frequency domain and recovers the clean speech waveform via a neural vocoder. Comprehensive experiments show USpeech achieves remarkable performance using synthetic ultrasound data comparable to physical data, outperforming state-of-the-art ultrasound-based speech enhancement baselines. USpeech is open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework
Authors: Mengshuo Jia, Zeyu Cui, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.

Title: On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectrum Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics
Authors: Hanyao Guo, Yunhai Han, Harish Ravichandar
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix that was computed using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectrum clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after clipping any eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate linear systems that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our codes and dataset can be found at this https URL.

Title: CLaMP 3: Universal Music Information Retrieval Across Unaligned Modalities and Unseen Languages
Authors: Shangda Wu, Zhancheng Guo, Ruibin Yuan, Junyan Jiang, Seungheon Doh, Gus Xia, Juhan Nam, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Maosong Sun
Abstract: CLaMP 3 is a unified framework developed to address challenges of cross-modal and cross-lingual generalization in music information retrieval. Using contrastive learning, it aligns all major music modalities--including sheet music, performance signals, and audio recordings--with multilingual text in a shared representation space, enabling retrieval across unaligned modalities with text as a bridge. It features a multilingual text encoder adaptable to unseen languages, exhibiting strong cross-lingual generalization. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, we curated M4-RAG, a web-scale dataset consisting of 2.31 million music-text pairs. This dataset is enriched with detailed metadata that represents a wide array of global musical traditions. To advance future research, we release WikiMT-X, a benchmark comprising 1,000 triplets of sheet music, audio, and richly varied text descriptions. Experiments show that CLaMP 3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MIR tasks, significantly surpassing previous strong baselines and demonstrating excellent generalization in multimodal and multilingual music contexts.

Title: Rapid and Inexpensive Inertia Tensor Estimation from a Single Object Throw
Authors: Till M. Blaha, Mike M. Kuijper, Radu Pop, Ewoud J.J. Smeur
Abstract: The inertia tensor is an important parameter in many engineering fields, but measuring it can be cumbersome and involve multiple experiments or accurate and expensive equipment. We propose a method to measure the moment of inertia tensor of a rigid body from a single spinning throw, by attaching a small and inexpensive stand-alone measurement device consisting of a gyroscope, accelerometer and a reaction wheel. The method includes a compensation for the increase of moment of inertia due to adding the measurement device to the body, and additionally obtains the location of the centre of gravity of the body as an intermediate result. Experiments performed with known rigid bodies show that the mean accuracy is around 2%.

Title: Logic-in-Frames: Dynamic Keyframe Search via Visual Semantic-Logical Verification for Long Video Understanding
Authors: Weiyu Guo, Ziyang Chen, Shaoguang Wang, Jianxiang He, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Ying Sun, Hui Xiong
Abstract: Understanding long video content is a complex endeavor that often relies on densely sampled frame captions or end-to-end feature selectors, yet these techniques commonly overlook the logical relationships between textual queries and visual elements. In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse frame subsampling, a challenge analogous to "finding a needle in a haystack." To address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that reformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical Search. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical dependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute dependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame sampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling context-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to specific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the manually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when applied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench and Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between textual queries and visual-temporal reasoning. The code will be publicly available.

Title: Value-Oriented Forecast Combinations for Unit Commitment
Authors: Mehrnoush Ghazanfariharandi, Robert Mieth
Abstract: Value-oriented forecasts for two-stage power system operational problems have been demonstrated to reduce cost, but prove to be computationally challenging for large-scale systems because the underlying optimization problem must be internalized into the forecast model training. Therefore, existing approaches typically scale poorly in the usable training data or require relaxations of the underlying optimization. This paper presents a method for value-oriented forecast combinations using progressive hedging, which unlocks high-fidelity, at-scale models and large-scale datasets in training. We also derive one-shot training model for reference and study how different modifications of the training model impact the solution quality.

Title: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis with Single Exposure
Authors: Kaixuan Zhang, Hu Wang, Minxian Li, Mingwu Ren, Mao Ye, Xiatian Zhu
Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR-NVS) aims to establish a 3D scene HDR model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) imagery. Typically, multiple-exposure LDR images are employed to capture a wider range of brightness levels in a scene, as a single LDR image cannot represent both the brightest and darkest regions simultaneously. While effective, this multiple-exposure HDR-NVS approach has significant limitations, including susceptibility to motion artifacts (e.g., ghosting and blurring), high capture and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the single-exposure HDR-NVS problem, where only single exposure LDR images are available during training. We further introduce a novel approach, Mono-HDR-3D, featuring two dedicated modules formulated by the LDR image formation principles, one for converting LDR colors to HDR counterparts, and the other for transforming HDR images to LDR format so that unsupervised learning is enabled in a closed loop. Designed as a meta-algorithm, our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing NVS models. Extensive experiments show that Mono-HDR-3D significantly outperforms previous methods. Source code will be released.

Title: Sensing Safety Analysis for Vehicular Networks with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
Authors: Tingyu Shui, Walid Saad, Mingzhe Chen
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing safety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically adjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular user (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve spoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the RIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect to the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly misled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity estimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can cause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\circ} with only a 5^{\circ} beam misalignment.

Title: Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling
Authors: Javier E. Santos, Agnese Marcato, Roman Colman, Nicholas Lubbers, Yen Ting Lin
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces, diffusing independently across pixels and color channels. As a result, they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications involving inherently discrete quantities-such as particle counts or material units-that are constrained by strict conservation laws like mass conservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving particle counts in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve particle conservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across standard image benchmarks, while exactly conditioning total image intensity. We validate DSD on two challenging scientific applications: porous rock microstructures and lithium-ion battery electrodes, demonstrating its ability to generate structurally realistic samples under strict mass conservation constraints, with quantitative evaluation using state-of-the-art metrics for transport and electrochemical performance.

Title: TSLFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for Turkish Sign Language Recognition Using Skeletal Landmarks
Authors: Kutay Ertürk, Furkan Altınışık, İrem Sarıaltın, Ömer Nezih Gerek
Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered, string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information. Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold. Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.

Title: M3G: Multi-Granular Gesture Generator for Audio-Driven Full-Body Human Motion Synthesis
Authors: Zhizhuo Yin, Yuk Hang Tsui, Pan Hui
Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio. However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating natural and expressive full-body human gestures.

Title: Dual-UAV-Enabled Secure Communication and Sensing for A2G-ISAC Systems with Maneuverable Jamming
Authors: Libiao Lou, Yuan Liu, Fotis Foukalas, Hongjiang Lei, Gaofeng Pan, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis, Hongwu Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a dual-functional source UAV and jamming UAV collaborate to enhance both the secure communication and target sensing performance. From a perspective of hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar, the jamming UAV maneuvers to aid the source UAV to detect multiple ground targets by emitting artificial noise, meanwhile interfering with the ground eavesdropper. Residual interference is considered to reflect the effects of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receive signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios, which results in a degraded system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR), the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are jointly optimized subject to the transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraint, and sensing requirements. To tackle the highly complicated non-convex ASR maximization problem, the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are optimized for the secure communication (SC) purpose and the SCS purpose, sequentially. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to optimize the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming iteratively, using the trust-region successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Then, a weighted distance minimization problem is formulated to determine the dual-UAV maneuvering positions suitable for the SCS purpose, which is solved by a heuristic greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming.

Title: Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series
Authors: Simon Schindler, Elias Steffen Reich, Saverio Messineo, Simon Hoher, Stefan Huber
Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.

Title: Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks based Video Enhancement
Authors: Kağan ÇETİN
Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Title: Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL). Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.
