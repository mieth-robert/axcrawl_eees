Title: Landmark Detection for Medical Images using a General-purpose Segmentation Model
Authors: Ekaterina Stansfield, Jennifer A. Mitterer, Abdulrahman Altahhan
Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Title: 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model for Whole-Body MR-to-CT Modality Translation
Authors: Jiaxu Zheng, Meiman He, Xuhui Tang, Xiong Wang, Tuoyu Cao, Tianyi Zeng, Lichi Zhang, Chenyu You
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony structures and soft-tissue contrast.

Title: Predicting Pulmonary Hypertension in Newborns: A Multi-view VAE Approach
Authors: Lucas Erlacher, Samuel Ruipérez-Campillo, Holger Michel, Sven Wellmann, Thomas M. Sutter, Ece Ozkan, Julia E. Vogt
Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches. Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment in newborns.

Title: Are Vision Foundation Models Ready for Out-of-the-Box Medical Image Registration?
Authors: Hanxue Gu, Yaqian Chen, Nicholas Konz, Qihang Li, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{this https URL}{Github}.

Title: JSQA: Speech Quality Assessment with Perceptually-Inspired Contrastive Pretraining Based on JND Audio Pairs
Authors: Junyi Fan, Donald Williamson
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score (MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Title: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Multi-objective Transmission Switching
Authors: Ding Lin, Jianhui Wang, Tianqiao Zhao, Meng Yue
Abstract: Transmission switching is a well-established approach primarily applied to minimize operational costs through strategic network reconfiguration. However, exclusive focus on cost reduction can compromise system reliability. While multi-objective transmission switching can balance cost savings with reliability improvements, feasible solutions become exceedingly difficult to obtain as system scale grows, due to the inherent nonlinearity and high computational demands involved. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for multi-objective transmission switching. The method incorporates a dueling-based actor-critic framework to evaluate the relative impact of each line switching decision within the action space, which improves decision quality and enhances both system reliability and cost efficiency. Numerical studies on the IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to two benchmark DRL algorithms.

Title: Reconfigurable Battery Systems for Enhanced Fast Charging in Electric Vehicles
Authors: Jonathan Olivares, Tyler Depe, Rakeshkumar Mahto
Abstract: The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as a key solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, prolonged charging times remain a significant barrier to widespread EV usage, especially for individuals without access to fast charging infrastructure. This paper explores the potential of reconfigurable battery systems to reduce EV charging times without compromising battery life. We propose innovative battery pack configurations that dynamically adjust the arrangement of cells to optimize charging performance. Simulations were conducted using MATLAB and Simulink to compare the efficiency of various battery configurations, focusing on charging times, state of charge (SOC), voltage, and current under different conditions. The results demonstrate that connecting more batteries in series through reconfigurability in battery packs can significantly reduce charging times while maintaining operational safety. This study offers insights into how reconfigurable battery designs can provide a practical solution for faster, more efficient home-based EV charging, making EV ownership more accessible and sustainable.

Title: Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions
Authors: Gayal Kuruppu, Neeraj Wagh, Yogatheesan Varatharajah
Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Title: Directional Measurements and Analysis for FR3 Low-Altitude Channels in a Campus Environment
Authors: Yulu Guo, Tongjia Zhang, Xiangwen Gu, Shu Sun, Meixia Tao, Ruifeng Gao
Abstract: In this paper, we present detailed low-altitude channel measurements at the FR3 band in an outdoor campus environment. Using a time-domain channel sounder system, we conduct two types of measurements: path loss measurements by moving the transmitter (Tx) at one-meter intervals along a 26-point rooftop path, and directional power angular spectrum measurements through antenna scanning at half-power beam width intervals. The path loss analysis across different Rx shows that the close-in model outperforms conventional 3GPP models and height-corrected variants, with path loss exponents close to free space values indicating line-of-sight dominance. The power angular spectrum measurements show that propagation behavior varies significantly with environmental conditions. Closer Rx exhibit stronger sensitivity to ground reflections during downward Tx tilting, while obstructed links display uniform angular characteristics due to dominant scattering effects, and corridor environments produce asymmetric power distributions. These results indicate that low-altitude propagation is characterized by complex interactions between Tx height and ground scattering mechanisms, providing fundamental insights for channel modeling in emerging mid-band communication systems.

Title: Mobility Extraction and Analysis of GaN HEMTs for RF Applications Using TCAD and Experimental Data
Authors: Tanjim Rahman
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) using both TCAD simulation and experimental characterization. The energy band structure was studied using Nextnano simulation software to observe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formation and carrier confinement under equilibrium conditions. Additionally, I-V and C-V data from fabricated research-grade GaN HEMTs were analyzed to extract key electrical parameters. The device demonstrated an ON current of 1.9 mA and an OFF current of 0.01 mA, indicating a strong ON/OFF current ratio. A subthreshold swing of 80 mV/decade and a DIBL of 5 mV/V were observed, confirming good gate control and short-channel suppression. The ON-resistance was 22.72 ohm per micron, with a saturation voltage of 1 V . The peak transconductance was extracted as 0.18 mS in the linear region and 0.5 mS in saturation. Field-effect mobility was calculated using the transconductance method, with a maximum value of approximately 1200 cm2/V.s at low drain bias. The combined simulation and experimental approach provided comprehensive insight into GaN HEMT behavior, enabling a deeper understanding of structure-performance relationships critical to advanced transistor design.

Title: Algorithm Design and Comparative Test of Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation Filter
Authors: Wenhan Cao, Tianyi Zhang, Shengbo Eben Li
Abstract: Popular Bayes filters typically rely on linearization techniques such as Taylor series expansion and stochastic linear regression to use the structure of standard Kalman filter. These techniques may introduce large estimation errors in nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems. This paper overviews a recent breakthrough in filtering algorithm design called \textit{N}atural Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation (NANO) filter and compare its performance over a large class of nonlinear filters. The NANO filter interprets Bayesian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, which allows to define optimal Gaussian approximation and derive its corresponding extremum conditions. The algorithm design still follows the two-step structure of Bayes filters. In the prediction step, NANO filter calculates the first two moments of the prior distribution, and this process is equivalent to a moment-matching filter. In the update step, natural gradient descent is employed to directly minimize the objective of the update step, thereby avoiding errors caused by model linearization. Comparative tests are conducted on four classic systems, including the damped linear oscillator, sequence forecasting, modified growth model, and robot localization, under Gaussian, Laplace, and Beta noise to evaluate the NANO filter's capability in handling nonlinearity. Additionally, we validate the NANO filter's robustness to data outliers using a satellite attitude estimation example. It is observed that the NANO filter outperforms popular Kalman filters family such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and posterior linearization filter (PLF), while having similar computational burden.

Title: A Composite Alignment-Aware Framework for Myocardial Lesion Segmentation in Multi-sequence CMR Images
Authors: Yifan Gao, Shaohao Rui, Haoyang Su, Jinyi Xiang, Lianming Wu, Xiaosong Wang
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial lesions from multi-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is essential for cardiac disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, achieving optimal feature correspondence is challenging due to intensity variations across modalities and spatial misalignment caused by inconsistent slice acquisition protocols. We propose CAA-Seg, a composite alignment-aware framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach. First, we introduce a selective slice alignment method that dynamically identifies and aligns anatomically corresponding slice pairs while excluding mismatched sections, ensuring reliable spatial correspondence between sequences. Second, we develop a hierarchical alignment network that processes multi-sequence features at different semantic levels, i.e., local deformation correction modules address geometric variations in low-level features, while global semantic fusion blocks enable semantic fusion at high levels where intensity discrepancies diminish. We validate our method on a large-scale dataset comprising 397 patients. Experimental results show that our proposed CAA-Seg achieves superior performance on most evaluation metrics, with particularly strong results in myocardial infarction segmentation, representing a substantial 5.54% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Joint UAV Placement and Transceiver Design in Multi-User Wireless Relay Networks
Authors: Tzu-Hsuan Chou, Nicolo Michelusi, David J. Love, James V. Krogmeier
Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to improve the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) among users in non-orthogonal multi-user wireless relay networks, by optimizing the placement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays, relay beamforming, and receive combining. The design is separated into two problems: beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization and transceiver design for minimum SINR maximization. A significant challenge in beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization is the lack of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) prior to deploying UAV relays, making it difficult to derive the beamforming SINR in non-orthogonal multi-user transmission. To address this issue, an approximation of the expected beamforming SINR is derived using the narrow beam property of a massive MIMO base station. Based on this, a UAV placement algorithm is proposed to provide UAV positions that improve the minimum expected beamforming SINR among users, using a difference-of-convex framework. Subsequently, after deploying the UAV relays to the optimized positions, and with estimated CSI available, a joint relay beamforming and receive combining (JRBC) algorithm is proposed to optimize the transceiver to improve the minimum beamforming SINR among users, using a block-coordinate descent approach. Numerical results show that the UAV placement algorithm combined with the JRBC algorithm provides a 4.6 dB SINR improvement over state-of-the-art schemes.

Title: Scene Graph-Aided Probabilistic Semantic Communication for Image Transmission
Authors: Chen Zhu, Siyun Liang, Zhouxiang Zhao, Jianrong Bao, Zhaohui Yang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Semantic communication emphasizes the transmission of meaning rather than raw symbols. It offers a promising solution to alleviate network congestion and improve transmission efficiency. In this paper, we propose a wireless image communication framework that employs probability graphs as shared semantic knowledge base among distributed users. High-level image semantics are represented via scene graphs, and a two-stage compression algorithm is devised to remove predictable components based on learned conditional and co-occurrence probabilities. At the transmitter, the algorithm filters redundant relations and entity pairs, while at the receiver, semantic recovery leverages the same probability graphs to reconstruct omitted information. For further research, we also put forward a multi-round semantic compression algorithm with its theoretical performance analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that our semantic-aware scheme achieves superior transmission throughput and satiable semantic alignment, validating the efficacy of leveraging high-level semantics for image communication.

Title: STFT-based Time-Frequency Mode Decomposition: A Fast and Robust Method for Multicomponent Signal Analysis
Authors: Wei Zhou, Wei-Jian Li, Wei-Xin Ren
Abstract: The decomposition of complex, multicomponent, and non-stationary signals into their constituent modes is a fundamental yet significant challenge in science and engineering. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among accuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the number of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition (TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of such signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous high-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline reframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is transformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the continuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding and connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to automatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The modes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform. Validation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately determines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its performance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative analysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a wider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals its superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design. The method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully extracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal. TFMD provides a computationally efficient and powerful paradigm for multicomponent signal analysis, offering a compelling balance of accuracy, versatility, and efficiency for large-scale or time-sensitive applications.

Title: Advantages of Feedback in Distributed Data-Gathering for Accurate and Power-Efficient State-Estimation
Authors: Hyeongmin Choe, Soojean Han
Abstract: In distributed target-tracking sensor networks, efficient data gathering methods are necessary to save communication resources and assure information accuracy. This paper proposes a Feedback (FB) distributed data-gathering method which lets the central unit feed information back to the mobile sensors; each sensor then uses it to cancel redundant transmissions and reduce communication congestion. We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional Non-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and advantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication delay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period, observation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain achieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region is nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends more on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the sensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete conditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical simulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived conditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex scenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.

Title: DSSD: Efficient Edge-Device Deployment and Collaborative Inference via Distributed Split Speculative Decoding
Authors: Jiahong Ning, Ce Zheng, Tingting Yang
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing but face critical deployment challenges in device-edge systems due to resource limitations and communication overhead. To address these issues, collaborative frameworks have emerged that combine small language models (SLMs) on devices with LLMs at the edge, using speculative decoding (SD) to improve efficiency. However, existing solutions often trade inference accuracy for latency or suffer from high uplink transmission costs when verifying candidate tokens. In this paper, we propose Distributed Split Speculative Decoding (DSSD), a novel architecture that not only preserves the SLM-LLM split but also partitions the verification phase between the device and edge. In this way, DSSD replaces the uplink transmission of multiple vocabulary distributions with a single downlink transmission, significantly reducing communication latency while maintaining inference quality. Experiments show that our solution outperforms current methods, and codes are at: this https URL

Title: Enhancing Situational Awareness in ISAC Networks via Drone Swarms: A Real-World Channel Sounding Data Set
Authors: Julia Beuster, Carsten Andrich, Sebastian Giehl, Marc Miranda, Lorenz Mohr, Dieter Novotny, Tom Kaufmann, Christian Schneider, Reiner Thomä
Abstract: With the upcoming capabilities of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and the incorporation of user equipment (UE) like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 6G mobile networks, there is a significant opportunity to enhance situational awareness through multi-static radar sensing in meshed ISAC networks. This paper presents a real-world channel sounding data set acquired using a testbed with synchronized, distributed ground-based sensor nodes and flying sensor nodes within a swarm of up to four drones. The conducted measurement campaign is designed to sense the bi-static reflectivity of objects such as parking cars, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and small drones in multi-path environments. We detail the rationale behind the selection of the included scenarios and the configuration of the participating nodesand present exemplary results to demonstrate the potential of using collaborating drone swarms for multi-static radar tracking and localization in air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios. The data sets are publicly available to support the development and validation of future ISAC algorithms in real-world environments rather than relying solely on simulation.

Title: Towards Ultra-Reliable 6G in-X Subnetworks: Dynamic Link Adaptation by Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Fateme Salehi, Aamir Mahmood, Sarder Fakhrul Abedin, Kyi Thar, Mikael Gidlund
Abstract: 6G networks are composed of subnetworks expected to meet ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for mission-critical applications such as industrial control and automation. An often-ignored aspect in URLLC is consecutive packet outages, which can destabilize control loops and compromise safety in in-factory environments. Hence, the current work proposes a link adaptation framework to support extreme reliability requirements using the soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that jointly optimizes energy efficiency (EE) and reliability under dynamic channel and interference conditions. Unlike prior work focusing on average reliability, our method explicitly targets reducing burst/consecutive outages through adaptive control of transmit power and blocklength based solely on the observed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The joint optimization problem is formulated under finite blocklength and quality of service constraints, balancing reliability and EE. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms, reducing outage bursts while consuming only 18\% of the transmission cost required by a full/maximum resource allocation policy in the evaluated scenario. The framework also supports flexible trade-off tuning between EE and reliability by adjusting reward weights, making it adaptable to diverse industrial requirements.

Title: Self-Boosted Weight-Constrained FxLMS: A Robustness Distributed Active Noise Control Algorithm Without Internode Communication
Authors: Junwei Ji, Dongyuan Shi, Zhengding Luo, Boxiang Wang, Woon-Seng Gan
Abstract: Compared to the conventional centralized multichannel active noise control (MCANC) algorithm, which requires substantial computational resources, decentralized approaches exhibit higher computational efficiency but typically result in inferior noise reduction performance. To enhance performance, distributed ANC methods have been introduced, enabling information exchange among ANC nodes; however, the resulting communication latency often compromises system stability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-boosted weight-constrained filtered-reference least mean square (SB-WCFxLMS) algorithm for the distributed MCANC system without internode communication. The WCFxLMS algorithm is specifically designed to mitigate divergence issues caused by the internode cross-talk effect. The self-boosted strategy lets each ANC node independently adapt its constraint parameters based on its local noise reduction performance, thus ensuring effective noise cancellation without the need for inter-node communication. With the assistance of this mechanism, this approach significantly reduces both computational complexity and communication overhead. Numerical simulations employing real acoustic paths and compressor noise validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory noise cancellation performance with minimal resource requirements.

Title: Distributed Resilient State Estimation and Control with Strategically Implemented Security Measures
Authors: Takumi Shinohara, Karl H. Johansson, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of distributed resilient state estimation and control for linear time-invariant systems in the presence of malicious false data injection sensor attacks and bounded noise. We consider a system operator (defender) capable of deploying cybersecurity measures to counteract the sensor compromises. Although such measures enhance resilience against adversarial attacks, they may incur substantial costs; hence, it is crucial to select countermeasures to balance resilience gains and cost efficiency strategically. We first demonstrate that the system's resilience against attacks is maximized through the appropriate implementation of security measures, implying that no attacker can execute undetectable sensor attacks. Building on this analysis, we propose an algorithm that identifies the optimal security measure. While determining this measure is NP-hard in general, we also derive sufficient conditions under which efficient computation is feasible. Furthermore, we develop a distributed resilient state estimation and control scheme informed by the optimal security measure and establish conditions that guarantee bounded estimation and control errors. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach via numerical simulations of a vehicle platooning scenario.

Title: VoxATtack: A Multimodal Attack on Voice Anonymization Systems
Authors: Ahmad Aloradi, Ünal Ege Gaznepoglu, Emanuël A. P. Habets, Daniel Tenbrinck
Abstract: Voice anonymization systems aim to protect speaker privacy by obscuring vocal traits while preserving the linguistic content relevant for downstream applications. However, because these linguistic cues remain intact, they can be exploited to identify semantic speech patterns associated with specific speakers. In this work, we present VoxATtack, a novel multimodal de-anonymization model that incorporates both acoustic and textual information to attack anonymization systems. While previous research has focused on refining speaker representations extracted from speech, we show that incorporating textual information with a standard ECAPA-TDNN improves the attacker's performance. Our proposed VoxATtack model employs a dual-branch architecture, with an ECAPA-TDNN processing anonymized speech and a pretrained BERT encoding the transcriptions. Both outputs are projected into embeddings of equal dimensionality and then fused based on confidence weights computed on a per-utterance basis. When evaluating our approach on the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge (VPAC) dataset, it outperforms the top-ranking attackers on five out of seven benchmarks, namely B3, B4, B5, T8-5, and T12-5. To further boost performance, we leverage anonymized speech and SpecAugment as augmentation techniques. This enhancement enables VoxATtack to achieve state-of-the-art on all VPAC benchmarks, after scoring 20.6% and 27.2% average equal error rate on T10-2 and T25-1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that incorporating textual information and selective data augmentation reveals critical vulnerabilities in current voice anonymization methods and exposes potential weaknesses in the datasets used to evaluate them.

Title: Inductance Estimation for High-Power Multilayer Rectangle Planar Windings
Authors: Theofilos Papadopoulos, Antonios Antonopoulos
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple and accurate monomial-like equation for estimating the inductance of Multilayer Rectangle-shaped Planar Windings (MLRPWs) for high-frequency, high-power applications. The equation consists of the power product of the geometrical dimensions, raised at individual power coefficients. The coefficients are generated via Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), based on a large set of approximately 6,000 simulated windings, with an 80/20 training/evaluation sample ratio. The resulting mean error value is 0%, with a standard deviation below 1.8%. The accuracy of the inductance estimation is confirmed on several experimental samples, with dimensions both within and outside the initial training dataset.

Title: Soft-Constrained Spatially Selective Active Noise Control for Open-fitting Hearables
Authors: Tong Xiao, Reinhild Roden, Matthias Blau, Simon Doclo
Abstract: Recent advances in spatially selective active noise control (SSANC) using multiple microphones have enabled hearables to suppress undesired noise while preserving desired speech from a specific direction. Aiming to achieve minimal speech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the optimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a soft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to trade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time- and frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise control and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise sources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and demonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the signal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of PESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained design.

Title: DoRF: Doppler Radiance Fields for Robust Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi
Authors: Navid Hasanzadeh, Shahrokh Valaee
Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However, despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability. The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

Title: A Practical Analysis: Understanding Phase Noise Modelling in Time and Frequency Domain for Phase-Locked Loops
Authors: Carl Collmann, Bitan Banerjee, Ahmad Nimr, Gerhard Fettweis
Abstract: In MIMO systems, the presence of phase noise is a significant factor that can degrade performance. For MIMO testbeds build from SDR devices, phase noise cannot be ignored, particular in applications that require phase synchronization. This is especially relevant in MIMO systems that employ digital beamforming, where precise phase alignment is crucial. Accordingly, accurate phase noise modelling of SDR devices is essential. However, the information provided in data sheets for different SDR models varies widely and is often insufficient for comprehensive characterization of their phase noise performance. While numerical simulations of PLL phase noise behavior are documented in the literature, there is a lack of extensive measurements supported by appropriate system modelling. In this work, we present a practical phase noise modeling methodology applied to an SDR from the USRP X310 series. Based on measurement data, we derive estimates of key PLL performance indicators such as cycle-to-cycle jitter, oscillator constants, and PLL bandwidth. Furthermore, we propose a parametric model for the phase noise PSD of the PLL circuit and provide corresponding parameter estimates. This model can be used for further investigation into the impact of phase noise on MIMO system performance implemented by similar SDR devices.

Authors: Pramit Karmakar, Siddharth B, Chinmay Murlidhar Kadnur Rao
Abstract: Energy Harvesting technologies will play a fundamental role in the development of the next generation of electronic systems as well as in advancing the development of sustainable infrastructure. One of the critical challenges in EH is utilizing ambient vibrations to harvest energy. Piezo Energy Harvesting, which uses ambient vibrations, is a promising technology in energy harvesting and a self-powered technology. However, it suffers from several practical challenges. Some of these challenges include narrow bandwidth, non-linearity, and impedance mismatch, among others. This paper presents a novel, simulated Piezo Energy Harvesting (PEH) framework that addresses some of these challenges. The proposed model is designed to be adaptive and effective against the inherent non-linearity of PEH. This detailed model covers a non-linear piezo, Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (SECE), Hybrid Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a Switched Capacitor Array (SCA). The SECE extracts the maximum charge accumulated on the piezo every time the piezo reaches the mechanical extremum. The Bouc-Wen model has been used to establish nonlinearity in the system. The hybrid MPPT exhibits significant improvement over conventional P&O, while the SCA-tuned system demonstrates resilience against variable frequency input.

Title: Learning, fast and slow: a two-fold algorithm for data-based model adaptation
Authors: Laura Boca de Giuli, Alessio La Bella, Riccardo Scattolini
Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of adapting data-based models over time. We propose a novel two-fold modelling architecture designed to correct plant-model mismatch caused by two types of uncertainty. Out-of-domain uncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in the initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from real-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To handle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the human brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored operating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems it necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a combination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical proximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and (ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises the ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of a new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain uncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast thinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the slow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP) model, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding older samples. The proposed methodology is tested on a benchmark energy system referenced in the literature, demonstrating that the combined use of slow and fast learning components improves model accuracy compared to standard adaptation approaches.

Title: PAPR of DFT-s-OTFS with Pulse Shaping
Authors: Jialiang Zhu, Sanoopkumar P. S., Arman Farhang
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) when the number of Doppler bins is large. To address this issue, a discrete Fourier transform spread OTFS (DFT-s-OTFS) scheme is employed by applying DFT spreading across the Doppler dimension. This paper presents a thorough PAPR analysis of DFT-s-OTFS in the uplink scenario using different pulse shaping filters and resource allocation strategies. Specifically, we derive a PAPR upper bound of DFT-s-OTFS with interleaved and block Doppler resource allocation schemes. Our analysis reveals that DFT-s-OTFS with interleaved allocation yields a lower PAPR than that of block allocation. Furthermore, we show that interleaved allocation produces a periodic time-domain signal composed of repeated quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) symbols which simplifies the transmitter design. Based on our analytical results, the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse generally results in a higher maximum PAPR compared to the rectangular pulse. Simulation results confirm the validity of the derived PAPR upper bounds. Furthermore, we also demonstrate through BER simulation analysis that the DFT-s-OTFS gives the same performance as OTFS without DFT spreading.

Title: Cell Sensing: Traffic detection
Authors: Saúl Fenollosa
Abstract: This work presents a passive sensing system for traffic monitoring using ambient Long Term Evolution (LTE) signals as a non-intrusive and scalable alternative to traditional surveillance methods. The approach employs a dual-receiver architecture analyzing Channel State Information (CSI) to isolate differential Doppler shifts induced by moving targets, effectively mitigating hardware-induced phase impairments. Implemented with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform and srsRAN software, the system demonstrated over 90% detection accuracy for speeds above 6000 mm/min in controlled indoor tests, and provided reliable speed estimations for pedestrians and vehicles in outdoor evaluations. Despite challenges at low speeds, directional ambiguity, and multipath fading in urban settings, the results validate LTE-based passive sensing as a feasible traffic monitoring method, identifying critical areas for future research such as angle-of-arrival (AoA) integration, machine learning, and real-time embedded system development.

Title: Novel Approach to Dual-Channel Estimation in Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G
Authors: Alejandro Castilla, Saúl Fenollosa, Monika Drozdowska, Alejandro Lopez-Escudero, Sergio Micò-Rosa, Narcis Cardona
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) design is crucial for 6G and harmonizes environmental data sensing with communication, emphasizing the need to understand and model these elements. This paper delves into dual-channel models for ISAC, employing channel extraction techniques to validate and enhance accuracy. Focusing on millimeter wave (mmWave) radars, it explores the extraction of the bistatic sensing channel from monostatic measurements and subsequent communication channel estimation. The proposed methods involve interference extraction, module and phase correlation analyses, chirp clustering, and auto-clutter reduction. A comprehensive set-up in an anechoic chamber with controlled scenarios evaluates the proposed techniques, demonstrating successful channel extraction and validation through Root Mean Square Delay Spread (RMS DS), Power Delay Profile (PDP), and Angle of Arrival (AoA) analysis. Comparison with Ray-Tracing (RT) simulations confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach, presenting an innovative stride towards fully integrated sensing and communication in future networks.

Title: Frequency-responsive RCS characteristics and scaling implications for ISAC development
Authors: Saúl Fenollosa, Monika Drozdowska, Wenfei Yang, Sergio Micó-Rosa, Alejandro Castilla, Alejandro Lopez-Escudero, Jian Li, Narcis Cardona
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation on the Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of various targets, with the objective of analysing how RCS properties vary with frequency. Targets such as an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), a pedestrian, and a full-scale car were measured in the frequency bands referred to in industry standards as FR2 and FR3. Measurements were taken in diverse environments, indoors and outdoors, to ensure comprehensive scenario coverage. The methodology employed in RCS extraction performs background subtraction, followed by time-domain gating to isolate the influence of the target. This analysis compares the RCS values and how the points of greatest contribution are distributed across different bands based on the range response of the RCS. Analysis of the results demonstrated how RCS values change with frequency and target shape, providing insights into the electromagnetic behaviour of these targets. Key findings highlight how much scaling RCS values based on frequency and geometry is complex and varies among different types of materials and shapes. These insights are instrumental for advancing sensing systems and enhancing 3GPP channel models, particularly for Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) techniques proposed for 6G standards.

Title: Constructed Realities? Technical and Contextual Anomalies in a High-Profile Image
Authors: Matthias Wjst
Abstract: This study offers a forensic assessment of a widely circulated photograph featuring Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell - an image that has played a pivotal role in public discourse and legal narratives. Through analysis of multiple published versions, several inconsistencies are identified, including irregularities in lighting, posture, and physical interaction, which are more consistent with digital compositing than with an unaltered snapshot. While the absence of the original negative and a verifiable audit trail precludes definitive conclusions, the technical and contextual anomalies suggest that the image may have been deliberately constructed. Nevertheless, without additional evidence, the photograph remains an unresolved but symbolically charged fragment within a complex story of abuse, memory, and contested truth.

Title: Neural Co-state Regulator: A Data-Driven Paradigm for Real-time Optimal Control with Input Constraints
Authors: Lihan Lian, Yuxin Tong, Uduak Inyang-Udoh
Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs) with input constraints in real-time. In this framework, a neural network (NN) learns to predict the optimal co-state trajectory that minimizes the control Hamiltonian for a given system, at any system's state, based on the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). Specifically, the NN is trained to find the norm-optimal co-state solution that simultaneously satisfies the nonlinear system dynamics and minimizes a quadratic regulation cost. The control input is then extracted from the predicted optimal co-state trajectory by solving a quadratic program (QP) to satisfy input constraints and optimality conditions. We coin the term neural co-state regulator (NCR) to describe the combination of the co-state NN and control input QP solver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the NCR, we compare its feedback control performance with that of an expert nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) solver on a unicycle model. Because the NCR's training does not rely on expert nonlinear control solvers which are often suboptimal, the NCR is able to produce solutions that outperform the nonlinear MPC solver in terms of convergence error and input trajectory smoothness even for system conditions that are outside its original training domain. At the same time, the NCR offers two orders of magnitude less computational time than the nonlinear MPC.

Title: Leveraging Bi-Directional Channel Reciprocity for Robust Ultra-Low-Rate Implicit CSI Feedback with Deep Learning
Authors: Zhenyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Zhi Ding
Abstract: Deep learning-based implicit channel state information (CSI) feedback has been introduced to enhance spectral efficiency in massive MIMO systems. Existing methods often show performance degradation in ultra-low-rate scenarios and inadaptability across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose Dual-ImRUNet, an efficient uplink-assisted deep implicit CSI feedback framework incorporating two novel plug-in preprocessing modules to achieve ultra-low feedback rates while maintaining high environmental robustness. First, a novel bi-directional correlation enhancement module is proposed to strengthen the correlation between uplink and downlink CSI eigenvector matrices. This module projects highly correlated uplink and downlink channel matrices into their respective eigenspaces, effectively reducing redundancy for ultra-low-rate feedback. Second, an innovative input format alignment module is designed to maintain consistent data distributions at both encoder and decoder sides without extra transmission overhead, thereby enhancing robustness against environmental variations. Finally, we develop an efficient transformer-based implicit CSI feedback network to exploit angular-delay domain sparsity and bi-directional correlation for ultra-low-rate CSI compression. Simulation results demonstrate successful reduction of the feedback overhead by 85% compared with the state-of-the-art method and robustness against unseen environments.

Title: Road Roughness Estimation via Fusion of Standard Onboard Automotive Sensors
Authors: Martin Agebjär, Gustav Zetterqvist, Fredrik Gustafsson, Johan Wahlström, Gustaf Hendeby
Abstract: Road roughness significantly affects vehicle vibrations and ride quality. We introduce a Kalman filter (KF)-based method for estimating road roughness in terms of the international roughness index (IRI) by fusing inertial and speed measurements, offering a cost-effective solution for pavement monitoring. The method involves system identification on a physical vehicle to estimate realistic model parameters, followed by KF-based reconstruction of the longitudinal road profile to compute IRI values. It explores IRI estimation using vertical and lateral vibrations, the latter more common in modern vehicles. Validation on 230 km of real-world data shows promising results, with IRI estimation errors ranging from 1% to 10% of the reference values. However, accuracy deteriorates significantly when using only lateral vibrations, highlighting their limitations. These findings demonstrate the potential of KF-based estimation for efficient road roughness monitoring.

Title: Mixed-integer Second-Order Cone Programming for Multi-period Scheduling of Flexible AC Transmission System Devices
Authors: Mohamad Charara (Polytechnique Montréal, GERAD &amp; MILA, Canada), Martin De Montigny (Hydro-Québec, Canada), Nivine Abou Daher (Hydro-Québec, Canada), Hanane Dagdougui (Polytechnique Montréal, GERAD &amp; MILA, Canada), Antoine Lesage-Landry (Polytechnique Montréal, GERAD &amp; MILA, Canada)
Abstract: With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads, losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv) thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making, ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.

Title: Symbolic Control: Unveiling Free Robustness Margins
Authors: Youssef Ait Si, Antoine Girard, Adnane Saoud
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring robustness in the presence of system perturbations for symbolic control techniques. Given a discrete-time control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins. We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform (state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Unit-Based Histopathology Tissue Segmentation via Multi-Level Feature Representation
Authors: Ashkan Shakarami, Azade Farshad, Yousef Yeganeh, Lorenzo Nicole, Peter Schuffler, Stefano Ghidoni, Nassir Navab
Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.

Title: Energy-based models for inverse imaging problems
Authors: Andreas Habring, Martin Holler, Thomas Pock, Martin Zach
Abstract: In this chapter we provide a thorough overview of the use of energy-based models (EBMs) in the context of inverse imaging problems. EBMs are probability distributions modeled via Gibbs densities $p(x) \propto \exp{-E(x)}$ with an appropriate energy functional $E$. Within this chapter we present a rigorous theoretical introduction to Bayesian inverse problems that includes results on well-posedness and stability in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional setting. Afterwards we discuss the use of EBMs for Bayesian inverse problems and explain the most relevant techniques for learning EBMs from data. As a crucial part of Bayesian inverse problems, we cover several popular algorithms for sampling from EBMs, namely the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs sampling, Langevin Monte Carlo, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Moreover, we present numerical results for the resolution of several inverse imaging problems obtained by leveraging an EBM that allows for the explicit verification of those properties that are needed for valid energy-based modeling.

Title: BitWave: Exploiting Column-Based Bit-Level Sparsity for Deep Learning Acceleration
Authors: Man Shi, Vikram Jain, Antony Joseph, Maurice Meijer, Marian Verhelst
Abstract: Bit-serial computation facilitates bit-wise sequential data processing, offering numerous benefits, such as a reduced area footprint and dynamically-adaptive computational precision. It has emerged as a prominent approach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits. As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called "bit-column-serial" and a compatible architecture design named "BitWave." BitWave harnesses the advantages of the "bit-column-serial" approach, leveraging structured bit-level sparsity in combination with dynamic dataflow techniques. This achieves a reduction in computations and memory footprints through redundant computation skipping and weight compression. BitWave is able to mitigate the performance drop or the need for retraining that is typically associated with sparsity-enhancing techniques using a post-training optimization involving selected weight bit-flips. Empirical studies conducted on four deep-learning benchmarks demonstrate the achievements of BitWave: (1) Maximally realize 13.25x higher speedup, 7.71x efficiency compared to state-of-the-art sparsity-aware accelerators. (2) Occupying 1.138 mm2 area and consuming 17.56 mW power in 16nm FinFet process node.

Title: SurgeryLSTM: A Time-Aware Neural Model for Accurate and Explainable Length of Stay Prediction After Spine Surgery
Authors: Ha Na Cho, Sairam Sutari, Alexander Lopez, Hansen Bow, Kai Zheng
Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal, explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

Title: Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation
Authors: Varun Velankar
Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes. Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database, we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1 seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in real-world scenarios.

Title: HCOMC: A Hierarchical Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control Framework in Mixed Traffic Environment on Two-Lane Highways
Authors: Tianyi Wang, Yangyang Wang, Jie Pan, Junfeng Jiao, Christian Claudel
Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.

Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate.

Title: Towards Scalable AASIST: Refining Graph Attention for Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Ivan Viakhirev, Daniil Sirota, Aleksandr Smirnov, Kirill Borodin
Abstract: Advances in voice conversion and text-to-speech synthesis have made automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems more susceptible to spoofing attacks. This work explores modest refinements to the AASIST anti-spoofing architecture. It incorporates a frozen Wav2Vec 2.0 encoder to retain self-supervised speech representations in limited-data settings, substitutes the original graph attention block with a standardized multi-head attention module using heterogeneous query projections, and replaces heuristic frame-segment fusion with a trainable, context-aware integration layer. When evaluated on the ASVspoof 5 corpus, the proposed system reaches a 7.6\% equal error rate (EER), improving on a re-implemented AASIST baseline under the same training conditions. Ablation experiments suggest that each architectural change contributes to the overall performance, indicating that targeted adjustments to established models may help strengthen speech deepfake detection in practical scenarios.

Title: A Multimodal Data Fusion Generative Adversarial Network for Real Time Underwater Sound Speed Field Construction
Authors: Wei Huang, Yuqiang Huang, Yanan Wu, Tianhe Xu, Junting Wang, Hao Zhang
Abstract: Sound speed profiles (SSPs) are essential parameters underwater that affects the propagation mode of underwater signals and has a critical impact on the energy efficiency of underwater acoustic communication and accuracy of underwater acoustic positioning. Traditionally, SSPs can be obtained by matching field processing (MFP), compressive sensing (CS), and deep learning (DL) methods. However, existing methods mainly rely on on-site underwater sonar observation data, which put forward strict requirements on the deployment of sonar observation systems. To achieve high-precision estimation of sound velocity distribution in a given sea area without on-site underwater data measurement, we propose a multi-modal data-fusion generative adversarial network model with residual attention block (MDF-RAGAN) for SSP construction. To improve the model's ability for capturing global spatial feature correlations, we embedded the attention mechanisms, and use residual modules for deeply capturing small disturbances in the deep ocean sound velocity distribution caused by changes of SST. Experimental results on real open dataset show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which achieves an accuracy with an error of less than 0.3m/s. Specifically, MDF-RAGAN not only outperforms convolutional neural network (CNN) and spatial interpolation (SITP) by nearly a factor of two, but also achieves about 65.8\% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction compared to mean profile, which fully reflects the enhancement of overall profile matching by multi-source fusion and cross-modal attention.

Title: Hybrid Conformal Prediction-based Risk-Aware Model Predictive Planning in Dense, Uncertain Environments
Authors: Jeongyong Yang, KwangBin Lee, SooJean Han
Abstract: Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk assessment.

Title: Schrödinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Shuichiro Nishigori, Koichi Saito, Naoki Murata, Masato Hirano, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schrödinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schrödinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schrödinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schrödinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient.

Title: Native-AI Empowered Scalable Architectures and Solutions for Future Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview
Authors: Jikang Deng, Fizza Hassan, Hui Zhou, Saad Al-Ahmadi, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Daniel B. Da Costa
Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient, reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures, the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle, hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are highlighted.

Title: IANN-MPPI: Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral Approach for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Kanghyun Ryu, Minjun Sung, Piyush Gupta, Jovin D'sa, Faizan M. Tariq, David Isele, Sangjae Bae
Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to perform efficient merging maneuvers. Our project website is available at this https URL

Title: Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Autoencoder with Automatically Generated Audio-Visual-Text Triplets from Videos
Authors: Yuchi Ishikawa, Shota Nakada, Hokuto Munakata, Kazuhiro Saito, Tatsuya Komatsu, Yoshimitsu Aoki
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning. LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations. We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Title: The Role of Rank in Mismatched Low-Rank Symmetric Matrix Estimation
Authors: Panpan Niu, Yuhao Liu, Teng Fu, Jie Fan, Chaowen Deng, Zhongyi Huang
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a Bayesian statistician tasked with recovering a rank-\(k\) signal matrix \(\bS \bS^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\), corrupted by element-wise additive Gaussian noise. This problem lies at the core of numerous applications in machine learning, signal processing, and statistics. We derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic mean-square error (MSE) of the Bayesian estimator under mismatches in the assumed signal rank, signal power, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), considering both sphere and Gaussian signals. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of how rank mismatch influences the asymptotic MSE. Our primary technical tools include the spectrum of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (GOE) with low-rank perturbations and asymptotic behavior of \(k\)-dimensional spherical integrals.

Title: Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with Onscreen/offscreen Classification
Authors: Kazuki Shimada, Archontis Politis, Iran R. Roman, Parthasaarathy Sudarsanam, David Diaz-Guerra, Ruchi Pandey, Kengo Uchida, Yuichiro Koyama, Naoya Takahashi, Takashi Shibuya, Shusuke Takahashi, Tuomas Virtanen, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3 of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change shifts the focus from more specialized 360° audio and audiovisual scene analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data, the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane (left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric, which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs reasonably well with the stereo audio data.

Title: MambaRate: Speech Quality Assessment Across Different Sampling Rates
Authors: Panos Kakoulidis, Iakovi Alexiou, Junkwang Oh, Gunu Jho, Inchul Hwang, Pirros Tsiakoulis, Aimilios Chalamandaris
Abstract: We propose MambaRate, which predicts Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with limited bias regarding the sampling rate of the waveform under evaluation. It is designed for Track 3 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025, which focuses on predicting MOS for speech in high sampling frequencies. Our model leverages self-supervised embeddings and selective state space modeling. The target ratings are encoded in a continuous representation via Gaussian radial basis functions (RBF). The results of the challenge were based on the system-level Spearman's Rank Correllation Coefficient (SRCC) metric. An initial MambaRate version (T16 system) outperformed the pre-trained baseline (B03) by ~14% in a few-shot setting without pre-training. T16 ranked fourth out of five in the challenge, differing by ~6% from the winning system. We present additional results on the BVCC dataset as well as ablations with different representations as input, which outperform the initial T16 version.

Title: HyDRA: A Hybrid Dual-Mode Network for Closed- and Open-Set RFFI with Optimized VMD
Authors: Hanwen Liu, Yuhe Huang, Yifeng Gong, Yanjie Zhai, Jiaxuan Lu
Abstract: Device recognition is vital for security in wireless communication systems, particularly for applications like access control. Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) offers a non-cryptographic solution by exploiting hardware-induced signal distortions. This paper proposes HyDRA, a Hybrid Dual-mode RF Architecture that integrates an optimized Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with a novel architecture based on the fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Mamba components, designed to support both closed-set and open-set classification tasks. The optimized VMD enhances preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy by fixing center frequencies and using closed-form solutions. HyDRA employs the Transformer Dynamic Sequence Encoder (TDSE) for global dependency modeling and the Mamba Linear Flow Encoder (MLFE) for linear-complexity processing, adapting to varying conditions. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in closed-set scenarios and robust performance in our proposed open-set classification method, effectively identifying unauthorized devices. Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, HyDRA achieves millisecond-level inference speed with low power consumption, providing a practical solution for real-time wireless authentication in real-world environments.

Title: Room Impulse Response Generation Conditioned on Acoustic Parameters
Authors: Silvia Arellano, Chunghsin Yeh, Gautam Bhattacharya, Daniel Arteaga
Abstract: The generation of room impulse responses (RIRs) using deep neural networks has attracted growing research interest due to its applications in virtual and augmented reality, audio postproduction, and related fields. Most existing approaches condition generative models on physical descriptions of a room, such as its size, shape, and surface materials. However, this reliance on geometric information limits their usability in scenarios where the room layout is unknown or when perceptual realism (how a space sounds to a listener) is more important than strict physical accuracy. In this study, we propose an alternative strategy: conditioning RIR generation directly on a set of RIR acoustic parameters. These parameters include various measures of reverberation time and direct sound to reverberation ratio, both broadband and bandwise. By specifying how the space should sound instead of how it should look, our method enables more flexible and perceptually driven RIR generation. We explore both autoregressive and non-autoregressive generative models operating in the Descript Audio Codec domain, using either discrete token sequences or continuous embeddings. Specifically, we have selected four models to evaluate: an autoregressive transformer, the MaskGIT model, a flow matching model, and a classifier-based approach. Objective and subjective evaluations are performed to compare these methods with state-of-the-art alternatives. Results show that the proposed models match or outperform state-of-the-art alternatives, with the MaskGIT model achieving the best performance.

Title: RadioDiff-3D: A 3D$\times$3D Radio Map Dataset and Generative Diffusion Based Benchmark for 6G Environment-Aware Communication
Authors: Xiucheng Wang, Qiming Zhang, Nan Cheng, Junting Chen, Zezhong Zhang, Zan Li, Shuguang Cui, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA, forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich, high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at this https URL.

Title: RUMAA: Repeat-Aware Unified Music Audio Analysis for Score-Performance Alignment, Transcription, and Mistake Detection
Authors: Sungkyun Chang, Simon Dixon, Emmanouil Benetos
Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment, score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.

Title: Selective Quantization Tuning for ONNX Models
Authors: Nikolaos Louloudakis, Ajitha Rajan
Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.

Title: Towards few-shot isolated word reading assessment
Authors: Reuben Smit, Retief Louw, Herman Kamper
Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL) models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data when used in a few-shot classification system.

Title: Spontaneous Spatial Cognition Emerges during Egocentric Video Viewing through Non-invasive BCI
Authors: Weichen Dai, Yuxuan Huang, Li Zhu, Dongjun Liu, Yu Zhang, Qibin Zhao, Andrzej Cichocki, Fabio Babiloni, Ke Li, Jianyu Qiu, Gangyong Jia, Wanzeng Kong, Qing Wu
Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.

Title: Traffic-Aware Pedestrian Intention Prediction
Authors: Fahimeh Orvati Nia, Hai Lin
Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention. However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states (Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

Title: Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length
Authors: Saptarshi Mitra, Rachid Karami, Haocheng Xu, Sitao Huang, Hyoukjun Kwon
Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.

Title: A single chip 1.024 Tb/s silicon photonics PAM4 receiver
Authors: Ali Pirmoradi, Han Hao, Kaisarbek Omirzakhov, Alexander J. Geers, Firooz Aflatouni
Abstract: Energy-efficient high-bandwidth interconnects play a key role in computing systems. Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength selective components have enabled the utilization of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers, offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency, bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers. Here, we report the demonstration of a single chip optical WDM PAM4 receiver, where by co-integration of a 32-channel optical demultiplexer (O-DeMux) with autonomous wavelength tuning and locking at a near-zero power consumption and a 32-channel ultra-low power concurrent electrical detection system, a record chip energy efficiency of under 0.38 pJ/bit is measured. The implemented 32 channel monolithic WDM optical receiver chip achieves an end-to-end latency of under 100 ps and a bit-error-rate of less than 10-12 with no equalization, pre-distortion, or digital-signal-processing, while operating at 1.024 Tb/s aggregate data-rate on a single input fiber, the largest reported data-rate for a WDM PAM4 receiver chip to date. The receiver bandwidth density of more than 3.55 Tb/s/mm2 corresponds to more than an order-of-magnitude larger bandwidth density-energy efficiency product compared to the state-of-the-art optical PAM4 receivers for beyond 100Gb/s links. The chip, integrated using GlobalFoundries 45CLO CMOS-photonic process, can be used for implementation of energy-efficient high data-rate optical links for AI applications.

Title: InstantGroup: Instant Template Generation for Scalable Group of Brain MRI Registration
Authors: Ziyi He, Albert C. S. Chung
Abstract: Template generation is a critical step in groupwise image registration, which involves aligning a group of subjects into a common space. While existing methods can generate high-quality template images, they often incur substantial time costs or are limited by fixed group scales. In this paper, we present InstantGroup, an efficient groupwise template generation framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) models that leverage latent representations' arithmetic properties, enabling scalability to groups of any size. InstantGroup features a Dual VAE backbone with shared-weight twin networks to handle pairs of inputs and incorporates a Displacement Inversion Module (DIM) to maintain template unbiasedness and a Subject-Template Alignment Module (STAM) to improve template quality and registration accuracy. Experiments on 3D brain MRI scans from the OASIS and ADNI datasets reveal that InstantGroup dramatically reduces runtime, generating templates within seconds for various group sizes while maintaining superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on quantitative metrics, including unbiasedness and registration accuracy.

Title: The Utility of the Virtual Imaging Trials Methodology for Objective Characterization of AI Systems and Training Data
Authors: Fakrul Islam Tushar, Lavsen Dahal, Saman Sotoudeh-Paima, Ehsan Abadi, W. Paul Segars, Ehsan Samei, Joseph Y. Lo
Abstract: Purpose: The credibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for medical imaging continues to be a challenge, affected by the diversity of models, the data used to train the models, and applicability of their combination to produce reproducible results for new data. Approach: In this work we aimed to explore if the emerging Virtual Imaging Trials (VIT) methodologies can provide an objective resource to approach this challenge. The study was conducted for the case example of COVID-19 diagnosis using clinical and virtual computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR) processed with convolutional neural networks. Multiple AI models were developed and tested using 3D ResNet-like and 2D EfficientNetv2 architectures across diverse datasets. Results: The performance differences were evaluated in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) and the DeLong method for AUC confidence intervals. The models trained on the most diverse datasets showed the highest external testing performance, with AUC values ranging from 0.73-0.76 for CT and 0.70-0.73 for CXR. Internal testing yielded higher AUC values (0.77 -0.85 for CT and 0.77-1.0 for CXR), highlighting a substantial drop in performance during external validation, which underscores the importance of diverse and comprehensive training and testing data. Most notably, VIT approach provided objective assessment of the utility of diverse models and datasets while further providing insight into the influence of dataset characteristics, patient factors, and imaging physics on AI efficacy. Conclusions: The VIT approach can be used to enhance model transparency and reliability, offering nuanced insights into the factors driving AI performance and bridging the gap between experimental and clinical settings.

Title: LHU-Net: a Lean Hybrid U-Net for Cost-efficient, High-performance Volumetric Segmentation
Authors: Yousef Sadegheih, Afshin Bozorgpour, Pratibha Kumari, Reza Azad, Dorit Merhof
Abstract: The rise of Transformer architectures has advanced medical image segmentation, leading to hybrid models that combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. However, these models often suffer from excessive complexity and fail to effectively integrate spatial and channel features, crucial for precise segmentation. To address this, we propose LHU-Net, a Lean Hybrid U-Net for volumetric medical image segmentation. LHU-Net prioritizes spatial feature extraction before refining channel features, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets (Synapse, Left Atrial, BraTS-Decathlon, and Lung-Decathlon), LHU-Net consistently outperforms existing models across diverse modalities (CT/MRI) and output configurations. It achieves state-of-the-art Dice scores while using four times fewer parameters and 20% fewer FLOPs than competing models, without the need for pre-training, additional data, or model ensembles. With an average of 11 million parameters, LHU-Net sets a new benchmark for computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy. Our implementation is available on GitHub: this https URL

Title: Embracing Fairness in Consumer Electricity Markets using an Automatic Market Maker
Authors: Shaun Sweeney, Chris King, Mark O'Malley, Robert Shorten
Abstract: As consumer flexibility becomes expected, it is important that the market mechanisms which attain that flexibility are perceived as fair. We set out fairness issues in energy markets today, and propose a market design to address them. Consumption is categorised as either essential or flexible with different prices and reliability levels for each. Prices are generated by an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) based on instantaneous scarcity and resource is allocated using a novel Fair Play algorithm. We empirically show the performance of the system over 1 year for 101 UK households and benchmark its performance against more classical approaches.

Title: Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks
Authors: Mohamad H. Kazma, Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in water distribution networks (WDNs), with a focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements (SP) that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a greedy algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic systems and observability theory, and yields SPs that are submodular and robust to hydraulic changes. Case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.

Title: Robust Convergency Indicator using MIMO-PI Controller in the presence of disturbances
Authors: Zimao Sheng, Hongan Yang, Jiakang Wang, Tong Zhang
Abstract: The PID controller remains the most widely adopted control architecture, with groundbreaking success across extensive implications. However, optimal parameter tuning for PID controller remains a critical challenge. Existing theories predominantly focus on linear time-invariant systems and Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) scenarios, leaving a research gap in addressing complex PID control problems for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with disturbances. This study enhances controller robustness by leveraging insights into the velocity form of nonlinear systems. It establishes a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of MIMO-PI controller, clarifies key theories on how robustness influences exponential error stabilization. Guided by these theories, an optimal robust MIMO-PI controller is developed without oversimplifying assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller achieves effective exponential stabilization and exhibits exceptional robustness under the guidance of the proposed robust indicator. Notably, the robust convergence indicator can also effectively assess comprehensive performance.

Title: SPA: Efficient User-Preference Alignment against Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Jiayuan Zhu, Junde Wu, Cheng Ouyang, Konstantinos Kamnitsas, J. Alison Noble
Abstract: Medical image segmentation data inherently contain uncertainty. This can stem from both imperfect image quality and variability in labeling preferences on ambiguous pixels, which depend on annotator expertise and the clinical context of the annotations. For instance, a boundary pixel might be labeled as tumor in diagnosis to avoid under-estimation of severity, but as normal tissue in radiotherapy to prevent damage to sensitive structures. As segmentation preferences vary across downstream applications, it is often desirable for an image segmentation model to offer user-adaptable predictions rather than a fixed output. While prior uncertainty-aware and interactive methods offer adaptability, they are inefficient at test time: uncertainty-aware models require users to choose from numerous similar outputs, while interactive models demand significant user input through click or box prompts to refine segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SPA}, a new \textbf{S}egmentation \textbf{P}reference \textbf{A}lignment framework that efficiently adapts to diverse test-time preferences with minimal human interaction. By presenting users with a select few, distinct segmentation candidates that best capture uncertainties, it reduces the user workload to reach the preferred segmentation. To accommodate user preference, we introduce a probabilistic mechanism that leverages user feedback to adapt a model's segmentation preference. The proposed framework is evaluated on several medical image segmentation tasks: color fundus images, lung lesion and kidney CT scans, MRI scans of brain and prostate. SPA shows 1) a significant reduction in user time and effort compared to existing interactive segmentation approaches, 2) strong adaptability based on human feedback, and 3) state-of-the-art image segmentation performance across different imaging modalities and semantic labels.

Title: Patherea: Cell Detection and Classification for the 2020s
Authors: Dejan Štepec, Maja Jerše, Snežana Đokić, Jera Jeruc, Nina Zidar, Danijel Skočaj
Abstract: We present Patherea, a unified framework for point-based cell detection and classification that enables the development and fair evaluation of state-of-the-art methods. To support this, we introduce a large-scale dataset that replicates the clinical workflow for Ki-67 proliferation index estimation. Our method directly predicts cell locations and classes without relying on intermediate representations. It incorporates a hybrid Hungarian matching strategy for accurate point assignment and supports flexible backbones and training regimes, including recent pathology foundation models. Patherea achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets - Lizard, BRCA-M2C, and BCData - while highlighting performance saturation on these benchmarks. In contrast, our newly proposed Patherea dataset presents a significantly more challenging benchmark. Additionally, we identify and correct common errors in current evaluation protocols and provide an updated benchmarking utility for standardized assessment. The Patherea dataset and code are publicly available to facilitate further research and fair comparisons.

Title: LUMINA-Net: Low-light Upgrade through Multi-stage Illumination and Noise Adaptation Network for Image Enhancement
Authors: Namrah Siddiqua, Kim Suneung, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial task in computer vision aimed at enhancing the visual fidelity of images captured under low-illumination conditions. Conventional methods frequently struggle with noise, overexposure, and color distortion, leading to significant image quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose LUMINA-Net, an unsupervised deep learning framework that learns adaptive priors from low-light image pairs by integrating multi-stage illumination and reflectance modules. To assist the Retinex decomposition, inappropriate features in the raw image can be removed using a simple self-supervised mechanism. First, the illumination module intelligently adjusts brightness and contrast while preserving intricate textural details. Second, the reflectance module incorporates a noise reduction mechanism that leverages spatial attention and channel-wise feature refinement to mitigate noise contamination. Through extensive experiments on LOL and SICE datasets, evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, LUMINA-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its efficacy in low-light image enhancement.

Title: Lightweight Hypercomplex MRI Reconstruction: A Generalized Kronecker-Parameterized Approach
Authors: Haosen Zhang, Jiahao Huang, Yinzhe Wu, Congren Dai, Fanwen Wang, Zhenxuan Zhang, Guang Yang
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for clinical diagnostics but is hindered by prolonged scan times. Current deep learning models enhance MRI reconstruction but are often memory-intensive and unsuitable for resource-limited systems. This paper introduces a lightweight MRI reconstruction model leveraging Kronecker-Parameterized Hypercomplex Neural Networks to achieve high performance with reduced parameters. By integrating Kronecker-based modules, including Kronecker MLP, Kronecker Window Attention, and Kronecker Convolution, the proposed model efficiently extracts spatial features while preserving representational power. We introduce Kronecker U-Net and Kronecker SwinMR, which maintain high reconstruction quality with approximately 50% fewer parameters compared to existing models. Experimental evaluation on the FastMRI dataset demonstrates competitive PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, even at high acceleration factors (8x and 16x), with no significant performance drop. Additionally, Kronecker variants exhibit superior generalization and reduced overfitting on limited datasets, facilitating efficient MRI reconstruction on hardware-constrained systems. This approach sets a new benchmark for parameter-efficient medical imaging models.

Title: Sharp Hybrid Zonotopes: Set Operations and the Reformulation-linearization Technique
Authors: Jonah J. Glunt, Joshua A. Robbins, Jacob A. Siefert, Daniel Silvestre, Herschel C. Pangborn
Abstract: Mixed integer set representations, and specifically hybrid zonotopes, have enabled new techniques for reachability and verification of nonlinear and hybrid systems. Mixed-integer sets which have the property that their convex relaxation is equal to their convex hull are said to be sharp. This property allows the convex hull to be computed with minimal overhead, and is known to be important for improving the convergence rates of mixed-integer optimization algorithms that rely on convex relaxations. This paper examines methods for formulating sharp hybrid zonotopes and provides sharpness-preserving methods for performing several key set operations. The paper then shows how the reformulation-linearization technique can be applied to create a sharp realization of a hybrid zonotope that is initially not sharp. A numerical example applies this technique to find the convex hull of a level set of a feedforward ReLU neural network.

Title: Space Surveillance with High-Frequency Radar
Authors: Brendan Hennessy, Heath Yardley, Rob Debnam, Tristan A. Camilleri, Nicholas K. Spencer, David A. Holdsworth, Goeff Warne, Brian Cheung, Sergey Kharabash
Abstract: High-Frequency (HF) radar is well suited to the surveillance of low-Earth-orbit space. For large targets, a small deployable HF radar is able to match the detection performance of much larger space surveillance radar systems operating at higher frequencies. However, there are some unique challenges associated with the use of HF, including the range--Doppler coupling bias, coarse detection-level localisation, and the presence of meteor returns and other unwanted signals. This paper details the use of HF radar for space surveillance, including signal processing and radar product formation, tracking, ionospheric correction, and orbit determination. It is shown that by fusing measurements from multiple passes, accurate orbital estimates can be obtained. Included are results from recent SpaceFest trials of the Defence Science and Technology Group's HF space surveillance radar, achieving real-time wide-area surveillance in tracking, orbit determination, and cueing of other space surveillance sensors.

Title: Diffused Responsibility: Analyzing the Energy Consumption of Generative Text-to-Audio Diffusion Models
Authors: Riccardo Passoni, Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Romain Serizel, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.

Title: Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning
Authors: Dang Thoai Phan, Tuan Anh Huynh, Van Tuan Pham, Cao Minh Tran, Van Thuan Mai, Ngoc Quy Tran
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.

Authors: Milica Škipina, Nikola Jovišić, Nicola Dall'Asen, Vanja Švenda, Anil Osman Tur, Slobodan Ilić, Elisa Ricci, Dubravko Ćulibrk
Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

Title: Algorithmic Approaches to Enhance Safety in Autonomous Vehicles: Minimizing Lane Changes and Merging
Authors: Seyed Moein Abtahi, Akramul Azim
Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promise enhanced safety and operational efficiency. However, frequent lane changes and merging maneuvers continue to pose significant safety risks and disrupt traffic flow. This paper introduces the Minimizing Lane Change Algorithm (MLCA), a state-machine-based approach designed to reduce unnecessary lane changes, thereby enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency. The MLCA algorithm prioritizes maintaining lane stability unless safety-critical conditions necessitate a lane change. The algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated through simulations conducted on the SUMO platform, comparing its performance against established models, including LC2017 and MOBIL. Results demonstrate substantial reductions in lane changes and collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow and improved safety metrics. Additionally, the study highlights the MLCA's adaptability to various traffic densities and roadway configurations, showcasing its potential for wide-scale deployment in real-world AV systems. Future work aims to validate these findings in more complex scenarios using the CARLA simulator, which will enable the testing of the algorithm under more dynamic and high-fidelity conditions, such as urban traffic environments with diverse road users. Moreover, the integration of cybersecurity measures for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication will be explored to ensure robust and secure data exchange, further enhancing the reliability and safety of AV operations. This research contributes to the broader goal of developing intelligent traffic systems that optimize both individual vehicle performance and overall traffic network efficiency.

Abstract: This paper reports IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \& Expo (ICME) 2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement. With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR) and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.

Title: A computationally frugal open-source foundation model for thoracic disease detection in lung cancer screening programs
Authors: Niccolò McConnell, Pardeep Vasudev, Daisuke Yamada, Daryl Cheng, Mehran Azimbagirad, John McCabe, Shahab Aslani, Ahmed H. Shahin, Yukun Zhou, The SUMMIT Consortium, Andre Altmann, Yipeng Hu, Paul Taylor, Sam M. Janes, Daniel C. Alexander, Joseph Jacob
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.

Title: An Energy Efficient Design of Hybrid NOMA Based on Hybrid SIC with Power Adaptation
Authors: Ning Wang, Chenyu Zhang, Yanshi Sun, Minghui Min, Yuanwei Liu, Shiyin Li
Abstract: Recently, hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) technology, which effectively utilizes both NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technologies through flexible resource allocation in a single transmission, has demonstrated immense potential for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. To further release the potential of HNOMA, this paper proposes a novel design of H-NOMA which jointly incorporates hybrid successive interference cancellation (HSIC) and power adaptation (PA) in the NOMA transmission phase. To reveal the potential of the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA scheme, closed-form expression for the probability of the event that H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA by consuming less energy is rigorously derived. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis demonstrates that the probability of the proposed H-NOMA scheme approaches 1 in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime without any constraints on either users' target rates or transmit power ratios. This represents a significant improvement over conventional H-NOMA schemes, which require specific restrictive conditions to achieve probability 1 at high SNRs as shown in existing work. The above observation indicates that with less energy consumption, the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA with probability 1 at high SNRs, and hence a higher energy efficiency. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and also demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed H-NOMA scheme.

Title: Epic-Sounds: A Large-scale Dataset of Actions That Sound
Authors: Jaesung Huh, Jacob Chalk, Evangelos Kazakos, Dima Damen, Andrew Zisserman
Abstract: We introduce EPIC-SOUNDS, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.

Title: Robot Metabolism: Towards machines that can grow by consuming other machines

Abstract: Biological lifeforms can heal, grow, adapt, and reproduce -- abilities essential for sustained survival and development. In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through AI, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.

Title: Energy-Efficient and Intelligent ISAC in V2X Networks with Spiking Neural Networks-Driven DRL
Authors: Chen Shang, Jiadong Yu, Dinh Thai Hoang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. However, designing efficient beamforming schemes for ISAC signals to achieve accurate sensing and enhance communication performance in the dynamic and uncertain environments of V2X networks presents significant challenges. While artificial intelligence technologies offer promising solutions, the energy-intensive nature of neural networks imposes substantial burdens on communication infrastructures. To address these challenges, this work proposes an energy-efficient and intelligent ISAC system for V2X networks. Specifically, we first leverage a Markov Decision Process framework to model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X networks. This framework allows the roadside unit to develop beamforming schemes relying solely on its current sensing information, eliminating the need for numerous pilot signals and extensive CSI acquisition. We then introduce an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, enabling the joint optimization of beamforming and power allocation to guarantee both communication rate and sensing accuracy in dynamic and uncertain V2X scenario. To alleviate the energy demands of neural networks, we integrate spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL algorithm. The event-driven, sparse spike-based processing of SNNs significantly improves energy efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with lower energy consumption, superior communication performance, and improved sensing accuracy.

Title: SPARK: A Modular Benchmark for Humanoid Robot Safety
Authors: Yifan Sun, Rui Chen, Kai S. Yun, Yikuan Fang, Sebin Jung, Feihan Li, Bowei Li, Weiye Zhao, Changliu Liu
Abstract: This paper introduces the Safe Protective and Assistive Robot Kit (SPARK), a comprehensive benchmark designed to ensure safety in humanoid autonomy and teleoperation. Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general safety solutions. To facilitate safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and development, SPARK provides simulation benchmarks that compare safety approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore, SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots. For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion Capture System as external sensors, while offering interfaces for seamless integration with alternative hardware setups at the same time. This paper demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as accelerate relevant research.

Title: Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Optimal Solutions and Efficient Algorithms
Authors: Lebin Chen, Ming-Min Zhao, Min-Jian Zhao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by movable antennas (MAs), which can dynamically adjust antenna positions to enhance both sensing and communication performance for future wireless networks. To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we first derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized for optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. In particular, for the case with receive MAs only, we provide a closed-form optimal antenna position solution, and show that employing MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) can achieve a sensing performance gain upper-bounded by 4.77 dB. On the other hand, for the case with transmit MAs only, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution in the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. While in the scenario with non-LoS (NLoS) channels, a majorization-minimization (MM) based Rosen's gradient projection (RGP) algorithm with an efficient initialization method is proposed to obtain stationary solutions for the considered problem, which can be extended to the general case with both transmit and receive MAs. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with FPAs in terms of sensing and communication performance trade-off.

Title: Deterministic and Statistical Analysis of the DoF of Continuous Linear Arrays in the Near Field
Authors: Athanasios G. Kanatas, Harris K. Armeniakos, Harpreet S. Dhillon, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees of freedom (DoF) in a wireless line-of-sight channel comprising a small continuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one. The framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions in a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at the origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four key parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that model the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the calculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which extends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step towards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field networks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the large number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveil key system-level insights. A comparison of the proposed method with the singular value decomposition-based method is illustrated to validate the model.

Title: BondMatcher: H-Bond Stability Analysis in Molecular Systems
Authors: Thomas Daniel, Malgorzata Olejniczak, Julien Tierny
Abstract: This application paper investigates the stability of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), as characterized by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). First, we contribute a database of 4544 electron densities associated to four isomers of water hexamers (the so-called Ring, Book, Cage and Prism), generated by distorting their equilibrium geometry under various structural perturbations, modeling the natural dynamic behavior of molecular systems. Second, we present a new stability measure, called bond occurrence rate, associating each bond path present at equilibrium with its rate of occurrence within the input ensemble. We also provide an algorithm, called BondMatcher, for its automatic computation, based on a tailored, geometry-aware partial isomorphism estimation between the extremum graphs of the considered electron densities. Our new stability measure allows for the automatic identification of densities lacking H-bond paths, enabling further visual inspections. Specifically, the topological analysis enabled by our framework corroborates experimental observations and provides refined geometrical criteria for characterizing the disappearance of H-bond paths. Our electron density database and our C++ implementation are available at this address: this https URL.

Title: Geometric Formulation of Unified Force-Impedance Control on SE(3) for Robotic Manipulators
Authors: Joohwan Seo, Nikhil Potu Surya Prakash, Soomi Lee, Arvind Kruthiventy, Megan Teng, Jongeun Choi, Roberto Horowitz
Abstract: In this paper, we present an impedance control framework on the SE(3) manifold, which enables force tracking while guaranteeing passivity. Building upon the unified force-impedance control (UFIC) and our previous work on geometric impedance control (GIC), we develop the geometric unified force impedance control (GUFIC) to account for the SE(3) manifold structure in the controller formulation using a differential geometric perspective. As in the case of the UFIC, the GUFIC utilizes energy tank augmentation for both force-tracking and impedance control to guarantee the manipulator's passivity relative to external forces. This ensures that the end effector maintains safe contact interaction with uncertain environments and tracks a desired interaction force. Moreover, we resolve a non-causal implementation problem in the UFIC formulation by introducing velocity and force fields. Due to its formulation on SE(3), the proposed GUFIC inherits the desirable SE(3) invariance and equivariance properties of the GIC, which helps increase sample efficiency in machine learning applications where a learning algorithm is incorporated into the control law. The proposed control law is validated in a simulation environment under scenarios requiring tracking an SE(3) trajectory, incorporating both position and orientation, while exerting a force on a surface.

Title: Miipher-2: A Universal Speech Restoration Model for Million-Hour Scale Data Restoration
Authors: Shigeki Karita, Yuma Koizumi, Heiga Zen, Haruko Ishikawa, Robin Scheibler, Michiel Bacchiani
Abstract: Training data cleaning is a new application for generative model-based speech restoration (SR). This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaveFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.

Title: Efficient and Direct Duplex Modeling for Speech-to-Speech Language Model
Authors: Ke Hu, Ehsan Hosseini-Asl, Chen Chen, Edresson Casanova, Subhankar Ghosh, Piotr Żelasko, Zhehuai Chen, Jason Li, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

Title: Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing
Authors: Satvik Dixit, Sungjoon Park, Chris Donahue, Laurie M. Heller
Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available upon publication.

Title: JIS: A Speech Corpus of Japanese Idol Speakers with Various Speaking Styles
Authors: Yuto Kondo, Hirokazu Kameoka, Kou Tanaka, Takuhiro Kaneko
Abstract: We construct Japanese Idol Speech Corpus (JIS) to advance research in speech generation AI, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). JIS will facilitate more rigorous evaluations of speaker similarity in TTS and VC systems since all speakers in JIS belong to a highly specific category: "young female live idols" in Japan, and each speaker is identified by a stage name, enabling researchers to recruit listeners familiar with these idols for listening experiments. With its unique speaker attributes, JIS will foster compelling research, including generating voices tailored to listener preferences-an area not yet widely studied. JIS will be distributed free of charge to promote research in speech generation AI, with usage restricted to non-commercial, basic research. We describe the construction of JIS, provide an overview of Japanese live idol culture to support effective and ethical use of JIS, and offer a basic analysis to guide application of JIS.

Title: Active Probing with Multimodal Predictions for Motion Planning
Authors: Darshan Gadginmath, Farhad Nawaz, Minjun Sung, Faizan M Tariq, Sangjae Bae, David Isele, Fabio Pasqualetti, Jovin D'sa
Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges.
