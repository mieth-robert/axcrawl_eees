Title: DualLaguerreNet: A Decoupled Spectral Filter GNN and the Uncovering of the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off
Authors: Huseyin Goksu
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.

Title: GegenbauerNet: Finding the Optimal Compromise in the GNN Flexibility-Stability Trade-off
Authors: Huseyin Goksu
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.

Title: Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech
Authors: Moran Yanuka, Paul Dixon, Eyal Finkelshtein, Daniel Rotman, Raja Giryes
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.

Title: THD-BAR: Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling for EEG Generic Representations
Authors: Wenchao Yang, Weidong Yan, Wenkang Liu, Yulan Ma, Yang Li
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a "next-scale-time prediction" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.

Title: A Deep Learning Density Shaping Model Predictive Gust Load Alleviation Control of a Compliant Wing Subjected to Atmospheric Turbulence
Authors: Seid H. Pourtakdoust, Amir H. Khodabakhsh
Abstract: This study presents a novel deep learning approach aimed at enhancing stochastic Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) specifically for compliant wings. The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles. The evaluation involved stochastic aerodynamic loads generated from Band-Limited White Noise (BLWN) and Dryden gust models. The evaluation were conducted for two distinct Compliant Chord Fractions (CCF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probability density shaping model predictive control in alleviating stochastic gust load and reducing wing tip deflection.

Title: Deep reinforcement learning-based spacecraft attitude control with pointing keep-out constraint
Authors: Juntang Yang, Mohamed Khalil Ben-Larbi
Abstract: This paper implements deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for spacecraft reorientation control with a single pointing keep-out zone. The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is adopted to handle continuous state and action space. A new state representation is designed to explicitly include a compact representation of the attitude constraint zone. The reward function is formulated to achieve the control objective while enforcing the attitude constraint. A curriculum learning approach is used for the agent training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based method for spacecraft pointing-constrained attitude control.

Title: Game-theoretic Decentralized Coordination for Airspace Sector Overload Mitigation
Authors: Jaehan Im, Daniel Delahaye, David Fridovich-Keil, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management systems offer a scalable alternative to centralized control, but often assume high levels of cooperation. In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function. Numerical experiments using 24 hours of European flight data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially reduces overload even with only minimal cooperation between sectors, while maintaining scalability and matching the solution quality of centralized solvers.

Title: Tri-Level Stochastic-Robust Co-Planning of Distribution Networks and Renewable Charging Stations With an Adaptive iC&CG Algorithm
Authors: Yongheng Wang, Xiemin Mo, Tao Liu
Abstract: Renewable charging stations (RCSs) that co-locate electric-vehicle (EV) charging with distributed generation (DG) can raise renewable utilization and improve distribution-network (DN) efficiency, yet their variability and the siting-dependent charging demand can overload feeders if placed poorly. This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs.

Title: Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance
Authors: Federico Taschin, Ozan K. Tonguz
Abstract: Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.

Title: Stochastic framework for scheduling preemptive upgrades of distribution transformers
Authors: William A Wheeler, Samuel Chevalier, Amritanshu Pandey
Abstract: Electrification of residential heating and transporta- tion has the potential to overload transformers in distribution feeders. Strategic scheduling of transformer upgrades to antici- pate increasing loads can avoid operational failures and reduce the risk of supply shortages. This work proposes a framework to prioritize transformer upgrades based on predicted loads at each meter, including heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. The framework follows a Monte Carlo approach to forecasting, generating many possible loading instances and collecting a distribution of failure probabilities for each transformer. In each loading instance, heat pumps and EVs are added stochastically to each meter over time, based on an overall estimated growth rate and factors specific to each customer. We set heat pump load profiles by temperature and EV load profiles based on a stochastic driving model and charging pattern. The load profiles feed into network topology and transformer failure models to calculate failure this http URL formulate a cost optimization based on these failure probabilities to schedule transformer upgrades. We demonstrate this approach on a real-world distribution feeder in rural Vermont under low, medium, and high-electrification scenarios. We find generally less than 20% of transformers having substantial risk of failure over a 20-year simulation. Lastly, we develop an optimization routine to schedule upgrades and discuss the expected number of failures.

Title: Targeted Algorithmic Purpose-Driven Cyber Attacks in Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization
Authors: Mahan FakouriFard, Mingxi Liu
Abstract: Distributed multi-agent optimization (DMAO) enables the scalable control and coordination of a large population of edge resources in complex multi-agent environments. Despite its great scalability, DMAO is prone to cyber attacks as it relies on frequent peer-to-peer communications that are vulnerable to malicious data injection and alteration. Existing cybersecurity research mainly focuses on \emph{broad-spectrum} attacks that aim to jeopardize the overall environment but fail to sustainably achieve specific or targeted objectives. This paper develops a class of novel strategic purpose-driven algorithmic attacks that are launched by participating agents and interface with DMAO to achieve self-interested attacking purposes. Theoretical foundations, in both primal and dual senses, are established for these attack vectors with and without stealthy features. Simulations on electric vehicle charging control validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithmic attacks and show the impacts of such attacks on the power distribution network.

Title: Data-Driven EV Charging Load Profile Estimation and Typical EV Daily Load Dataset Generation
Authors: Linhan Fang, Jesus Silva-Rodriguez, Xingpeng Li
Abstract: Widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption introduces new challenges for distribution grids due to large, localized load increases, stochastic charging behavior, and limited data availability. This paper proposes two data-driven methods to estimate residential EV charging profiles using real-world customer meter data from CenterPoint Energy serving the Houston area. The first approach applies a least-squares estimation to extract average charging rates by comparing aggregated EV and non-EV meter data, enabling a statistical method for starting and ending charge times. The second method isolates EV load from meter profiles and applies a kernel density estimation (KDE) to develop a probabilistic charging model. Both methods produce a distinct "u-shaped" daily charging profile, with most charging occurring overnight. The validated profiles offer a scalable tool for utilities to better anticipate EV-driven demand increases and support proactive grid planning.

Title: Just Few States are Enough: Randomized Sparse Feedback for Stability of Dynamical Systems
Authors: Zaid Hadach, Hajar El Hammouti, El Houcine Bergou, Adnane Saoud
Abstract: While classical control theory assumes that the controller has access to measurements of the entire state (or output) at every time instant, this paper investigates a setting where the feedback controller can only access a randomly selected subset of the state vector at each time step. Due to the random sparsification that selects only a subset of the state components at each step, we analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of Asymptotic Mean-Square Stability (AMSS), which ensures that the system state converges to zero in the mean-square sense. We consider the problem of designing both a feedback gain matrix and a measurement sparsification strategy that minimizes the number of state components required for feedback, while ensuring AMSS of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, (1) we provide conditions on the dynamics of the system under which it is possible to find a sparsification strategy, and (2) we propose a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based algorithm that jointly computes a stabilizing gain matrix, and a randomized sparsification strategy that minimizes the expected number of measured state coordinates while preserving the AMSS. Our approach is then extended to the case where the sparsification probabilities vary across the state components. Based on these theoretical findings, we propose an algorithmic procedure to compute the vector of sparsification parameters, along with the corresponding feedback gain matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the stability properties of control systems that rely solely on randomly selected state measurements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in some settings, the system achieves comparable performance to full-state feedback while requiring measurements from only $0.3\%$ of the state coordinates.

Title: Dynamic state estimation of hybrid systems: Inverters that switch between grid-following and grid-forming control schemes
Authors: Bukunmi G. Odunlami, Marcos Netto
Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid system modeling framework for inverters that switch between grid-following and grid-forming control schemes. In particular, such inverters are modeled as hybrid automata with guard conditions on voltage and frequency, and reset maps that maintain consistent phase, frequency, and droop references during mode transitions. The hybrid model is embedded within an extended Kalman filter to assess estimation performance under explicit mode switching. Results show that the proposed framework ensures stable, well-behaved dynamics and improves state estimation, especially near switching instants, compared with smooth continuous models.

Title: A congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism for regions allowing passive balancing
Authors: Hang Thanh Nguyen, Bart Van Der Holst, Phuong Hong Nguyen, Koen Kok
Abstract: Maintaining system balance becomes increasingly challenging as market design and grid capacity enhancement lag behind the growing share of renewables, requiring greater effort from both the transmission system operator (TSO) and the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs). An actor can support balancing actively by bidding into reserve markets, or passively by adjusting its portfolio in line with system needs. In some countries, BRPs are incentivized to engage in passive balancing when their deviations support overall system stability. However, BRPs focus on profit maximization rather than minimizing portfolio discrepancies, which can cause simultaneous responses to price signals and create issues at the transmission-distribution interface. This research provides a two-stage stochastic model that captures BRP dynamic behavior and their impact on the grid under day-ahead and balancing market price uncertainty across three imbalance pricing mechanisms: the single, dual, and two-price. Then, a congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism is proposed that maintains incentives for passive balancing while satisfying the grid constraint. A proof of concept is provided via the simulation with a part of the Dutch distribution grid. Results show that the proposed method mitigates the unexpected peak flow issue in congested areas while preserving passive balancing contributions from other BRPs in non-congested areas.

Title: L-Functions Certify Set Attractivity for Discrete-Time Uncertain Nonlinear Switched Systems
Authors: Alejandro Anderson, Esteban A. Hernandez-Vargas, Giulia Giordano
Abstract: We introduce the class of L-functions to certify the attractivity of sets for uncertain nonlinear switched systems in discrete time. The existence of an L-function associated with a set guarantees the robust local attractivity of that set under the system dynamics. We propose a constructive method for obtaining piecewise-continuous L-functions based on contractive sets for the system, and show that the existence of a robust control contractive set for the dynamics implies the existence of an appropriate L-function, and hence the robust local attractivity of the set itself. We illustrate the proposed framework through examples that elucidate the theoretical concepts, and through the case study of a nonlinear switched system modelling antimicrobial resistance, which highlights the relevance of the approach to the analysis of biological systems.

Title: Compute-in-Memory Implementation of State Space Models for Event Sequence Processing
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhang, Mingtao Hu, Sen Lu, Soohyeon Kim, Eric Yeu-Jer Lee, Yuyang Liu, Wei D. Lu
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.

Title: Self-Supervised Compression and Artifact Correction for Streaming Underwater Imaging Sonar
Authors: Rongsheng Qian, Chi Xu, Xiaoqiang Ma, Hao Fang, Yili Jin, William I. Atlas, Jiangchuan Liu
Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

Title: Dissipativity-Based Distributed Stability Analysis for Networks with Heterogeneous Nonlinear Agents
Authors: Ingyu Jang, Ethan J. LoCicero, Leila Bridgeman
Abstract: Stabilizing large networks of nonlinear agents is challenging; decomposition and distributed analysis of these networks are crucial for computational tractability and information security. Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem enables both properties concurrently in distributed network analysis. This paper explored combining it with the alternating direction methods of multipliers to develop distributed stability analysis for networks of inhomogeneous, nonlinear agents. One algorithm enhances information security by requiring agents to share only a dissipativity characterization, not a dynamical model, for stability analysis. A second algorithm further restricts this information sharing to their clique, thereby enhancing security, and can also reduce the computational burden of stability analysis if the network allows chordal decomposition. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated, and criteria are identified for decomposable networks facilitating chordal decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples involving a swarm of linearized unmanned aerial vehicles and networks beyond linear time-invariant agents.

Title: Consensus-Based Stability Analysis of Multi-Agent Networks
Authors: Ingyu Jang, Ethan J. LoCicero, Leila Bridgeman
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale multi-agent systems has led to controller synthesis methods for sparse communication between agents. However, most sparse controller synthesis algorithms remain centralized, requiring information exchange and high computational costs. This underscores the need for distributed algorithms that design controllers using only local dynamics information from each agent. This paper presents a consensus-based distributed stability analysis. The proposed stability analysis algorithms leverage Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem and the alternating direction methods of multipliers to perform general stability analysis. Numerical examples involving a 2D swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms.

Title: dkpy: Robust Control with Structured Uncertainty in Python
Authors: Timothy Everett Adams, Steven Dahdah, James Richard Forbes
Abstract: Models used for control design are, to some degree, uncertain. Model uncertainty must be accounted for to ensure the robustness of the closed-loop system. $\mu$-analysis and $\mu$-synthesis methods allow for the analysis and design of controllers subject to structured uncertainties. Moreover, these tools can be applied to robust performance problems as they are fundamentally robust control problems with structured uncertainty. The contribution of this paper is dkpy, an open-source Python package for performing robust controller analysis and synthesis for systems subject to structured uncertainty. dkpy also provides tools for performing model uncertainty characterization using data from a set of perturbed systems. The open-source project can be found at this https URL.

Title: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multicarrier Cognitive Radio ISAC
Authors: Alireza Fadakar, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: The fusion of cognitive radio (CR) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enabled by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), offers a promising path for multi-functional programmable front ends in 6G and beyond. In this paper we propose a novel CR-ISAC framework that leverages an SIM integrated with the secondary base station (SB) to learn and realize optimal beampatterns that simultaneously (i) minimize the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) for localizing a secondary user equipment (SU) and (ii) limit averaged interference at primary user equipments (PUs) so that spectral efficiency loss is constrained, with the target of at most a few percent degradation. We propose an efficient alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain the optimal end-to-end transmission response of the SIM for all orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers. Drawing an analogy between the layered SIM architecture and deep neural networks, we define a beampattern- matching loss, derive analytical gradients for backpropagation, and implement a learning-based optimization of the SIM coefficients using a mini-batch Adam optimizer. A complexity analysis is provided, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed CR-ISAC framework. The results show that the proposed SIM coefficient optimization methods attain near-optimal performance in terms of both the SU BCRB localization metric and the PUs average spectral efficiency when the SIM has a sufficient number of layers, and they substantially outperform traditional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designs.

Title: Power Delivery for Cryogenic Scalable Quantum Applications: Challenges and Opportunities
Authors: Yating Zou, Batuhan Keskin, Gregor G. Taylor, Zenghui Li, Jie Wang, Eduard Alarcon, Fabio Sebastiano, Masoud Babaie, Edoardo Charbon
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer unprecedented capabilities in computation and secure information transfer. Their implementation requires qubits to operate at cryogenic temperatures (CT) while control and readout electronics typically still remains at room temperature (RT). As systems scale to millions of qubits, the electronics should also operate at CT to avoid a wiring bottleneck. However, wired power transfer from RT for such electronics introduces severe challenges, including thermal load between cooling stages, Joule heating, noise coupling, and wiring scalability. This paper addresses those challenges by evaluating several candidate architectures for scalable power transfer in the dilution frige: high-voltage (HV) wired power transfer, radiative wireless transfer, non-radiative wireless transfer, and a hybrid HV and non-radiative transfer. These architectures are analyzed in terms of thermal load, power loss, heating, coupling noise, power density, scalability, reliability, and complexity. Comparative analysis demonstrates the trade-offs among these architectures, while highlighting HV non-radiative transfer as a promising candidate for scalable quantum systems.

Title: PoCGM: Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction
Authors: Changsheng Fang, Yongtong Liu, Bahareh Morovati, Shuo Han, Li Zhou, Hengyong Yu
Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), reducing the number of projection views is an effective strategy to lower radiation exposure and/or improve temporal resolution. However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.

Title: On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices
Authors: Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez
Abstract: Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.

Title: Cross-Sparsity-Enabled Multipath Perception via Structured Bayesian Inference for Multi-Target Estimation
Authors: Xiang Chen, Ming-Min Zhao, An Liu, Min Li, Qingjiang Shi, Min-Jian Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-target sensing system in multipath environment, where inter-target scattering gives rise to first-order reflected paths whose angles of departure (AoDs) and angles of arrival (AoAs) coincide with the direct-path angles of different targets. Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity.

Title: ELiC: Efficient LiDAR Geometry Compression via Cross-Bit-depth Feature Propagation and Bag-of-Encoders
Authors: Junsik Kim, Gun Bang, Soowoong Kim
Abstract: Hierarchical LiDAR geometry compression encodes voxel occupancies from low to high bit-depths, yet prior methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, limiting compression efficiency. We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication.

Authors: Lehuai Xu, Zirui Lu, Haoran Yang, Yina Zhou
Abstract: With the increasing demand for real-time Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification on edge devices, existing models face challenges of high computational cost and limited accuracy on imbalanced this http URL paper presents Multi-task DFNet, a lightweight multi-task framework for ECG classification across the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, enabling efficient task collaboration by dynamically sharing knowledge across tasks, such as arrhythmia detection, myocardial infarction (MI) classification, and other cardiovascular abnormalities. The proposed method integrates GRU-augmented Diffusion, where the GRU is embedded within the diffusion model to capture temporal dependencies better and generate high-quality synthetic signals for imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that Multi-task DFNet achieves 99.72% and 99.89% accuracy on the MIT-BIH dataset and PTB dataset, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters compared to traditional models, making it suitable for deployment on wearable ECG monitors. This work offers a compact and efficient solution for multi-task ECG diagnosis, providing a promising potential for edge healthcare applications on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.

Title: FxSearcher: gradient-free text-driven audio transformation
Authors: Hojoon Ki, Jongsuk Kim, Minchan Kwon, Junmo Kim
Abstract: Achieving diverse and high-quality audio transformations from text prompts remains challenging, as existing methods are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a limited set of differentiable audio effects. This paper proposes \textbf{FxSearcher}, a novel gradient-free framework that discovers the optimal configuration of audio effects (FX) to transform a source signal according to a text prompt. Our method employs Bayesian Optimization and CLAP-based score function to perform this search efficiently. Furthermore, a guiding prompt is introduced to prevent undesirable artifacts and enhance human preference. To objectively evaluate our method, we propose an AI-based evaluation framework. The results demonstrate that the highest scores achieved by our method on these metrics align closely with human preferences. Demos are available at this https URL

Title: Data Center Control Against Sub-Synchronous Resonance: A Data-Driven Approach
Authors: Grant Ruan, Marija D. Ilic, Le Xie
Abstract: Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration.

Title: Uncertainty Discounting in Deterministic Black Box Price Predictions for Energy Arbitrage
Authors: Arnab Bhattacharjee
Abstract: This study examines the economic impact of post-hoc uncertainty discounting in predictive energy management, specifically in battery energy arbitrage. A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints. This approach enhances decision-making in energy arbitrage while remaining practical, scalable, and independent of specific forecasting models

Title: A Receding Horizon Reinforcement Learning Framework for Campus Chiller Energy Management - A case study from an Australian University
Authors: Laura Musgrave, Arnab Bhattacharjee, Tapan Kumar Saha
Abstract: This work presents a case study of optimal energy management of a large Heating Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) system within a university campus in Australia using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The HVAC system supplies to nine university buildings with an annual average electricity consumption of $\sim2$ GWh. Updated chiller Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves are identified, and a predictive building cooling demand model is developed using historical data from the HVAC system. Based on these inputs, a Proximal Policy Optimization based RL model is trained to optimally schedule the chillers in a receding horizon control framework with a priority reward function for constraint satisfaction. Compared to the traditional way of controlling the HVAC system based on a reactive rule-based method, the proposed controller saves up to 28\% of the electricity consumed by simply controlling the mass flow rates of the chiller banks and with minimal constraint violations.

Title: Entirely Transformerless Universal Direct-Injection Power-Flow Controller
Authors: Davood Keshavarzi, Alexander Koehler, Wolfram H. Wellssow, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: An increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, electric vehicle chargers, and energy storage systems into low-voltage power grids causes several power management and stability problems, such as reverse power flow, (local) overload lines, and over- / under-voltage. Previous power-flow and soft-open-point solutions are bulky and expensive. They need transformers and large magnetics, some on grid frequency, others more compact at high frequency. Even suggested circuits with high-frequency transformers still struggle with cost and size. We present a compact partial power-conversion high-current full-power-flow control circuit without a single transformer. We combine silicon and silicon-carbide, each with their specific advantages for current-dense direct injection. The circuit further needs fewer semiconductors than previous concepts. The circuit links a shunt converter through a non-isolated inverter bidirectionally with low-voltage series modules that practically float with their respective phases can serve between different feeders in low-voltage power grids. We analyze the circuit mathematically and evaluate the operation in simulation and experimental results.

Title: Improved Decoupled Control of Modular Multilevel Converter under Constaint of Nearest Level Modulation via Disturbance Observer Design
Authors: Jaeyeon Park, Dongjoon Kim, Seungjun Lee, Shenghui Cui
Abstract: Nearest level modulation (NLM) is an attractive modulation method for its implementation simplicity in modular multilevel converter (MMC). However, it introduces significant voltage and current distortion when the number of submodules (SMs) per arm is small, as in medium-voltage applications. While indirect modulation offers fully decoupled control of ac-side current, dc-side current and SM capacitor energy, its performance is fundamentally reliant on accurate arm voltage synthesis, making it incompatible with the large quantization error inherent in NLM. To resolve this conflict, this paper proposes a new control strategy based on a disturbance observer (DOB). The key idea is to estimate and actively compensate for the inevitable arm voltage synthesis error induced by NLM, thereby enabling fully decoupled control of indirect-modulated MMC even under NLM operation with a small number of SMs. A key advantage is its ease of implementation, as it requires no modifications to the conventional NLM and decoupled control structure. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in improving current quality and decoupled SM energy control are verified through both simulation and experimental results.

Title: Secure parameter identification of ARX systems with CKKS cryptosystem
Authors: Jialong Chen, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper focuses on the cloud-based parameter identification problem of ARX systems while protecting the system input and output. To do so, a CKKS-cryptosystem-based parameter identification algorithm is proposed. By rigorously proving that the statistical distance between the Gaussian distribution and the truncated discrete one is negligible, the algorithm has the same security level as the standard CKKS cryptosystem. By utilizing the projection mapping on the estimates, the conditions for correct encryption and decryption are given. Based on these conditions, the stochastic approximation method is further employed to achieve the almost sure and mean square convergence of the algorithm. The effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical example.

Title: A graph-informed regret metric for optimal distributed control
Authors: Daniele Martinelli, Andrea Martin, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate, Luca Furieri
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of large-scale systems using distributed controllers with a network topology that mirrors the coupling graph between subsystems. In this work, we introduce spatial regret, a graph-informed metric that measures the worst-case performance gap between a distributed controller and an oracle which is assumed to have access to additional sensor information. The oracle's graph is a user-specified augmentation of the available information graph, resulting in a benchmark policy that highlights disturbances for which additional sensor information would significantly improve performance. Minimizing spatial regret yields distributed controllers-respecting the nominal information graph-that emulate the oracle's response to disturbances that are characteristic of large-scale networks, such as localized perturbations. We show that minimizing spatial regret admits a convex reformulation as an infinite program with a finite-dimensional approximation. To scale to large networks, we derive a computable upper bound on the spatial regret metric whose minimization problem can be solved in a distributed way. Numerical experiments on power-system models demonstrate that the resulting controllers mitigate localized disturbances more effectively than controllers optimized using classical metrics.

Title: Overtourism to Equilibrium: A System Dynamics & Multi-Objective Model for Sustainable Destinations
Authors: Huanzhu Lyu, Xiao Yang, Xintong Ji
Abstract: Overtourism poses severe challenges to popular destinations worldwide, threatening natural environments and local communities. This paper develops a decision-making model integrating system dynamics with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) to balance economic returns, environmental protection, and social satisfaction. We collect multi-source data from 2008-2024 including visitor arrivals (up to 3.1M), government revenue/expenditure (up to $10.3M), glacier retreat (220-350 ft), CO2 emissions (77K-105K tons), and social satisfaction (0.29-0.48), and establish a dynamic system with four modules: tourist behavior, government finance, environmental evolution, and social well-being. We optimize three objectives via NSGA-II: cumulative net revenue, final environmental index, and final social satisfaction. Experiments on Juneau show optimal solutions yield net revenue up to $1.64B with environmental index 0.93 and social satisfaction 0.86. Extending to Iceland reveals Pareto fronts spanning revenues $150M-$200M, environment indices up to 0.92, and social satisfaction above 0.80. Sobol and Morris sensitivity analyses indicate carbon fees and price elasticity account for over 60% of environmental outcome variance, while capacity limits explain around 90% of net revenue variability. Scenario simulations demonstrate how capacity limits and dynamic pricing on crowded attractions, combined with marketing and infrastructure investment in lesser-known sites, mitigate congestion and enhance sustainability. This work contributes: (i) an integrated system-dynamics and NSGA-II framework for sustainable tourism management; (ii) demonstrated portability via case studies on Juneau and Iceland; and (iii) global sensitivity analysis highlighting influential policy levers for decision makers.

Title: Multi-Timescale Model Predictive Control for Slow-Fast Systems
Authors: Lukas Schroth, Daniel Morton, Amon Lahr, Daniele Gammelli, Andrea Carron, Marco Pavone
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling autonomy across diverse applications. While model fidelity is crucial in MPC, solving the corresponding optimization problem in real time remains challenging when combining long horizons with high-fidelity models that capture both short-term dynamics and long-term behavior. Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.

Title: An adaptive extension to robust data-driven predictive control under parametric uncertainty
Authors: Ignacio Sanchez, Filiberto Fele, Daniel Limon
Abstract: Robust data-driven controllers typically rely on datasets from previous experiments, which embed information on the variability of the system parameters across past operational conditions. Complementarily, data collected online can contribute to improving the feedback performance relative to the current system's conditions, but are unable to account for the overall -- possibly time-varying -- system operation. With this in mind, we consider the problem of stabilizing a time-varying linear system, whose parameters are only known to lie within a bounded polytopic set. Taking a robust data-driven approach, we synthesize the control law by simultaneously leveraging two sets of historical state and input measures: an offline dataset -- which covers the extreme variations of the system parameters -- and an online dataset consisting of a rolling window of the latest state and input samples. Our approach relies on the data informativity framework: we thus relax persistent excitation requirements (i.e., the collected samples need not be sufficient for system identification), while still allowing for the design of a stabilizing controller. The state feedback law is obtained from standard Lyapunov arguments, implemented via semi-definite optimization: this also yields an upper bound on the cost-to-go for the class of systems that are consistent with the online data, while guaranteeing a decreasing cost for all systems compatible with the offline data. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Title: Offset-free Data-Driven Predictive Control for Grid-Connected Power Converters in Weak Grid Faults
Authors: Ivo Kraayeveld, Thomas de Jong, Mircea Lazar
Abstract: Grid-connected power converters encounter significant stability challenges during weak grid faults, when conventional PI-based controllers exhibit an oscillatory response and poor fault-ride-through performance. This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids.

Title: Identifying Time-varying Costs in Finite-horizon Linear Quadratic Gaussian Games
Authors: Kai Ren, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: We address cost identification in a finite-horizon linear quadratic Gaussian game. We characterize the set of cost parameters that generate a given Nash equilibrium policy. We propose a backpropagation algorithm to identify the time-varying cost parameters. We derive a probabilistic error bound when the cost parameters are identified from finite trajectories. We test our method in numerical and driving simulations. Our algorithm identifies the cost parameters that can reproduce the Nash equilibrium policy and trajectory observations.

Title: Accelerating Automatic Differentiation of Direct Form Digital Filters
Authors: Chin-Yun Yu, György Fazekas
Abstract: We introduce a general formulation for automatic differentiation through direct form filters, yielding a closed-form backpropagation that includes initial condition gradients. The result is a single expression that can represent both the filter and its gradients computation while supporting parallelism. C++/CUDA implementations in PyTorch achieve at least 1000x speedup over naive Python implementations and consistently run fastest on the GPU. For the low-order filters commonly used in practice, exact time-domain filtering with analytical gradients outperforms the frequency-domain method in terms of speed.

Title: TTA: Transcribe, Translate and Alignment for Cross-lingual Speech Representation
Authors: Wei Liu, Jiahong Li, Yiwen Shao, Dong Yu
Abstract: Speech-LLM models have demonstrated great performance in multi-modal and multi-task speech understanding. A typical speech-LLM paradigm is integrating speech modality with a large language model (LLM). While the Whisper encoder was frequently adopted in previous studies for speech input, it shows limitations regarding input format, model scale, and semantic performance. To this end, we propose a lightweight TTA model specialized in speech semantics for more effective LLM integration. With large-scale training of 358k hours of speech data on multilingual speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST) and speech-text alignment tasks, TTA is capable of producing robust cross-lingual speech representations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including ASR/ST, speech retrieval, and ASR-LLM performance assessments, demonstrate TTA's superiority over Whisper. Furthermore, we rigorously validate the interplay between cross-lingual capabilities and ASR/ST performance. The model weights and training recipes of TTA will be released as part of an audio understanding toolkit Auden.

Title: Integrated Positioning and Communication for Cooperative Multi-LEO Uplink Communications: A Dual-Timescale Kalman Filter-Aided Approach
Authors: Ali Hanif, Yuchen Zhang, Pinjun Zheng, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are a crucial component of the future non-terrestrial networks (NTN) due to lower latency, robust signal strengths, shorter revisit times, and dense constellations. However, acquiring reliable channel state information (CSI) in LEO satellite communication remains challenging owing to severe signal attenuation over long propagation distances and short coherence times. Despite these challenges, LEO channels benefit from pronounced line-of-sight dominance and geometric properties inherently tied to positioning information. In this work, we propose an integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework for multi-LEO satellite networks to address the unique challenges posed by LEO channels. Specifically, we leverage in-the-loop LEO positioning to exploit users' position information for improving uplink CSI acquisition. To overcome the link-budget limitations of single-satellite systems, cooperative multi-LEO uplink data detection is adopted. By exploiting the different coherent timescales of position-related parameters and random channel gains, we develop a dual-timescale Kalman filter-based IPAC framework: an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for tracking users' position and velocity in the large-timescale, and a Kalman filter that leverages the position information obtained in the large-timescale for improved data-aided uplink channel estimation in the small-timescale. Finally, the two tasks of channel estimation and cooperative data detection are jointly addressed through the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IPAC approach outperforms the conventional baseline in terms of channel estimation accuracy and communication performance.

Title: Ultra-Low Insertion Loss Stepped Impedance Resonator Topology for HTSC RF Front-End
Authors: Ilan Kurtser, Yoav Koral, Eldad Holdengreber, Shmuel E. Schacham, Eliyahu Farber
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and measurement of a high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR) band-pass filter for S-band applications, and its incorporation into a cryogenic receiver cascade. The 11-pole filter, implemented in YBa2Cu3O(7-x) (YBCO) thin films on sapphire, exhibits an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of -0.1~dB, a sharp roll-off of 100~MHz, and a rejection level exceeding --80~dB. These measured results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported IL for an S-band filter with this number of poles. When integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA), system-level simulations and measurements predict a receiver noise figure (NF) of 0.34~dB at 3.39~GHz, enabling a 20% increase in radar detection range compared with conventional copper-based front ends. This work demonstrates the feasibility of practical HTSC-based RF front-ends for next-generation communication and radar systems.

Title: Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges
Authors: Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.

Title: Covariance-based Imaging and Multi-View Fusion for Networked Sensing
Authors: Junyuan Gao, Weifeng Zhu, Yanmo Hu, Shuowen Zhang, Jiannong Cao, Yongpeng Wu, Giuseppe Caire, Liang Liu
Abstract: This paper considers multi-view imaging in a sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication network, which consists of a transmit base-station (BS), multiple receive BSs connected to a central processing unit (CPU), and multiple extended targets. Our goal is to devise an effective multi-view imaging technique that can jointly leverage the targets' echo signals at all the receive BSs to precisely construct the image of these targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-phase approach. In Phase I, each receive BS recovers an individual image based on the sample covariance matrix of its received signals. Specifically, we propose a novel covariance-based imaging framework to jointly estimate effective scattering intensity and grid positions, which reduces the number of estimated parameters leveraging channel statistical properties and allows grid adjustment to conform to target geometry. In Phase II, the CPU fuses the individual images of all the receivers to construct a high-quality image of all the targets. Specifically, we design edge-preserving natural neighbor interpolation (EP-NNI) to map individual heterogeneous images onto common and finer grids, and then propose a joint optimization framework to estimate fused scattering intensity and BS fields of view. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly enhances imaging performance, facilitating high-quality environment reconstruction for future 6G networks.

Title: Adversarial Learning-Based Radio Map Reconstruction for Fingerprinting Localization
Authors: Jiaming Zhang, Jiajun He, Tianyu Lu, Jie Zhang, Okan Yurduseven
Abstract: This letter presents a feature-guided adversarial framework, namely ComGAN, which is designed to reconstruct an incomplete fingerprint database by inferring missing received signal strength (RSS) values at unmeasured reference points (RPs). An auxiliary subnetwork is integrated into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to enable spatial feature learning. An optimization method is then developed to refine the RSS predictions by aggregating multiple prediction sets, achieving an improved localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) comparable to the ground-truth measurements while outperforming state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. When the reconstructed fingerprint is combined with measured data for training, the fingerprinting localization achieves accuracy comparable to models trained on fully measured datasets.

Title: Tri-Hybrid Beamforming Design for Fully-Connected Pinching Antenna Systems
Authors: Cheng-Jie Zhao, Zhaolin Wang, Hyundong Shin, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A novel fully-connected (FC) tri-hybrid beamforming (THB) architecture is proposed for pinching antenna systems (PASS). In contrast to conventional sub-connected (SC) PASS, the proposed FC architecture employs a tunable phase-shifter network to interconnect all radio frequency (RF) chains with all waveguides. This facilitates a THB framework that integrates conventional hybrid analog-digital beamforming with pinching beamforming. A weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamformers and pinching antenna (PA) positions. Two algorithms are developed to address this challenging non-convex problem. 1) Fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm: This algorithm directly maximizes the WSR using an FP-based alternating optimization framework. Particularly, a success-history based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE) method is proposed to optimize PA positions, effectively addressing the intractable multimodal objective function. 2) Zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm: To reduce design complexity, zero-forcing is employed for transmit beamforming. The PA positions are subsequently optimized to maximize the WSR via a modified SHADE method. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, revealing that the FC-THB PASS achieves WSR comparable to the SC architecture while delivering superior energy efficiency with fewer RF chains.

Title: Stratospheric Grid: A Wireless Power Transfer Enabled HAP Network with Integrated Generation-Grid-Load-Storage Functions
Authors: Peng Wang, Eros Kuikel, Jia Ye, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: Conventional high-altitude platforms (HAPs) face challenges in achieving continuous all-weather operation due to intermittent photovoltaic power generation, limited energy storage capacity, and high mission loads resulting from functional integration. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a stratospheric energy grid in which wireless power transfer (WPT) interconnections constitute the grid layer, while HAPs operate as dynamically reconfigurable integrated generation-grid-load-storage (IGGLS) nodes that harvest, buffer, consume, and peer-to-peer transfer energy for constellation-level balancing and resilience. In this system, each HAP node can flexibly switch among energy source, load, and storage roles according to its energy status and mission requirements, enabling energy exchange and spatiotemporal optimization within the stratosphere. Through cooperative scheduling, the stratospheric grid not only enables surplus-to-deficit energy support among HAPs but also extends upward to satellites and downward to the terrestrial grid and communication infrastructure, forming a heterogeneous, WPT-mediated interconnection. As an IGGLS ecosystem, it exploits peer-to-peer energy logistics, spatiotemporal smoothing of intermittency, cross-domain backup via the terrestrial grid, and service-aware dispatch, thereby boosting overall energy utilization and operational resilience. The proposed approach is validated through case studies, and we delineate an agenda of feasible research directions.

Title: A Two-Stage ISAC Framework for Low-Altitude Economy Based on 5G NR Signals
Authors: Haisu Wu, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan, Boshi Wang, Jun Tang, Haoyang Weng, Feng Shu, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: The evolution of next-generation wireless networks has spurred the vigorous development of the low-altitude economy (LAE). To support this emerging field while remaining compatible with existing network architectures, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) based on 5G New Radio (NR) signals is regarded as a promising solution. However, merely leveraging standard 5G NR signals, such as the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), presents fundamental limitations in sensing resolution. To address the issue, this paper proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine sensing framework that utilizes standard 5G NR initial access signals augmented by a custom-designed sparse pilot structure (SPS) for high-precision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) sensing. In Stage I, we first fuse information from the SSB, Type\#0-PDCCH, and system information block 1 (SIB1) to ensure the initial target detection. In Stage II, a refined estimation algorithm is introduced to overcome the resolution limitations of these signals. Inspired by the sparse array theory, this stage employs a novel SPS, which is inserted into resource blocks (RBs) within the CORSET\#0 bandwidth. To accurately extract the off-grid range and velocity parameters from these sparse pilots, we develop a corresponding high-resolution algorithm based on the weighted unwrapped phase (WUP) technique and the RELAX-based iterative method. Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adopted to prune the redundant detections arising from beam overlap. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in comparison to other techniques.

Title: Doppler Invariant CNN for Signal Classification
Authors: Avi Bagchi, Dwight Hutchenson
Abstract: Radio spectrum monitoring in contested environments motivates the need for reliable automatic signal classification technology. Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.

Title: Robust Offset-free Kernelized Data-Driven Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Mahmood Mazare, Hossein Ramezani
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Kernelized Data-Driven Predictive Control (KDPC) scheme for robust, offset-free tracking of nonlinear systems. Our computationally efficient hybrid approach separates the prediction: (1) kernel ridge regression learns the nonlinear map from past trajectories, and (2) analytical linearization of the kernel map approximates the effect of future inputs. This linearization is key, allowing the controller to be formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP) for efficient real-time implementation. Offset-free tracking is inherently achieved by using input increments. We provide theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The algorithm is validated on a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, where it successfully rejects unmeasured disturbances and eliminates steady-state errors, outperforming a standard model-based controller.

Title: NERD: Network-Regularized Diffusion Sampling For 3D Computed Tomography
Authors: Shijun Liang, Ismail Alkhouri, Qing Qu, Rongrong Wang, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Numerous diffusion model (DM)-based methods have been proposed for solving inverse imaging problems. Among these, a recent line of work has demonstrated strong performance by formulating sampling as an optimization procedure that enforces measurement consistency, forward diffusion consistency, and both step-wise and backward diffusion consistency. However, these methods have only considered 2D reconstruction tasks and do not directly extend to 3D image reconstruction problems, such as in Computed Tomography (CT). To bridge this gap, we propose NEtwork-Regularized diffusion sampling for 3D CT (NERD) by incorporating an L1 regularization into the optimization objective. This regularizer encourages spatial continuity across adjacent slices, reducing inter-slice artifacts and promoting coherent volumetric reconstructions. Additionally, we introduce two efficient optimization strategies to solve the resulting objective: one based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and another based on the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method. Experiments on medical 3D CT data demonstrate that our approach achieves either state-of-the-art or highly competitive results.

Title: Towards AC Feasibility of DCOPF Dispatch
Authors: Michael A. Boateng, Russell Bent, Sidhant Misra, Parikshit Pareek, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Daniel Molzahn
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is widely utilized in power system operations due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5.

Title: Emotion Recognition in Multi-Speaker Conversations through Speaker Identification, Knowledge Distillation, and Hierarchical Fusion
Authors: Xiao Li, Kotaro Funakoshi, Manabu Okumura
Abstract: Emotion recognition in multi-speaker conversations faces significant challenges due to speaker ambiguity and severe class imbalance. We propose a novel framework that addresses these issues through three key innovations: (1) a speaker identification module that leverages audio-visual synchronization to accurately identify the active speaker, (2) a knowledge distillation strategy that transfers superior textual emotion understanding to audio and visual modalities, and (3) hierarchical attention fusion with composite loss functions to handle class imbalance. Comprehensive evaluations on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving 67.75% and 72.44% weighted F1 scores respectively, with particularly notable improvements on minority emotion classes.

Title: MS2Edge: Towards Energy-Efficient and Crisp Edge Detection with Multi-Scale Residual Learning in SNNs
Authors: Yimeng Fan, Changsong Liu, Mingyang Li, Yuzhou Dai, Yanyan Liu, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Edge detection with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has achieved remarkable prog\-ress but faces two major challenges. First, it requires pre-training on large-scale extra data and complex designs for prior knowledge, leading to high energy consumption. Second, the predicted edges perform poorly in crispness and heavily rely on post-processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as third generation neural networks, feature quantization and spike-driven computation mechanisms. They inherently provide a strong prior for edge detection in an energy-efficient manner, while its quantization mechanism helps suppress texture artifact interference around true edges, improving prediction crispness. However, the resulting quantization error inevitably introduces sparse edge discontinuities, compromising further enhancement of crispness. To address these challenges, we propose MS2Edge, the first SNN-based model for edge detection. At its core, we build a novel spiking backbone named MS2ResNet that integrates multi-scale residual learning to recover missing boundary lines and generate crisp edges, while combining I-LIF neurons with Membrane-based Deformed Shortcut (MDS) to mitigate quantization errors. The model is complemented by a Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB) for detail reconstruction during upsampling and a Membrane Average Decoding (MAD) method for effective integration of edge maps across multiple time steps. Experimental results demonstrate that MS2Edge outperforms ANN-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, PLDU, and PLDM datasets without pre-trained backbones, while maintaining ultralow energy consumption and generating crisp edge maps without post-processing.

Title: Semantic Multiplexing
Authors: Mohammad Abdi, Francesca Meneghello, Francesco Restuccia
Abstract: Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\times$, 25$\times$, and 54$\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.

Title: Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos
Authors: Kranti Kumar Parida, Omar Emara, Hazel Doughty, Dima Damen
Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Title: Contactless Monitoring of Muscle Vibrations During Exercise with a Chaos-Inspired Radar
Authors: Jiangyifei Zhu, Yuzhe Wang, Tao Qiang, Vu Phan, Zhixiong Li, Evy Meinders, Eni Halilaj, Justin Chan, Swarun Kumar
Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to enable quantitative feedback on muscle fatigue during exercise to optimize exercise effectiveness while minimizing injury risk. We seek to capture fatigue by monitoring surface vibrations that muscle exertion induces. Muscle vibrations are unique as they arise from the asynchronous firing of motor units, producing surface micro-displacements that are broadband, nonlinear, and seemingly stochastic. Accurately sensing these noise-like signals requires new algorithmic strategies that can uncover their underlying structure. We present GigaFlex the first contactless system that measures muscle vibrations using mmWave radar to infer muscle force and detect fatigue. GigaFlex draws on algorithmic foundations from Chaos theory to model the deterministic patterns of muscle vibrations and extend them to the radar domain. Specifically, we design a radar processing architecture that systematically infuses principles from Chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics throughout the sensing pipeline, spanning localization, segmentation, and learning, to estimate muscle forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing exercises. Across a 23-participant study, GigaFlex estimates maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.9\%, and detects one to three Repetitions in Reserve (RIR), a key quantitative muscle fatigue metric, with an AUC of 0.83 to 0.86, performing comparably to a contact-based IMU baseline. Our system can enable timely feedback that can help prevent fatigue-induced injury, and opens new opportunities for physiological sensing of complex, non-periodic biosignals.

Title: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Heterogeneous Data: A Lagrangian Approach
Authors: Zifan Wang, Georgios Pantazis, Sergio Grammatico, Michael M. Zavlanos, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.

Title: Intrinsic Resonance depends on Network Size of Coupled-Delayed Interacting Oscillators
Authors: Felipe A. Torres, Alejandro Weinstein, Jesus M. Cortes, Wael El-Deredy
Abstract: The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $\Omega$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $\Omega \approx (\sum_j c_{ij} \tau)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs.

Title: Deep-Learning Based Super-Resolution Functional Ultrasound Imaging of Transient Brain-Wide Neurovascular Activity on a Microscopic Scale
Authors: Yang Cai, Shaoyuan Yan, Long Xu, Yanfeng Zhu, Bo Li, Kailiang Xu
Abstract: Transient brain-wide neuroimaging on a microscopic scale is pivotal for brain research, yet current modalities face challenges in meeting such spatiotemporal requirements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) enables transient neurovascular imaging through red blood cell backscattering, but suffers from diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We hypothesize that deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction can break through this limitation, introducing super-resolution functional ultrasound (SR-fUS) which leverages ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) data to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of red blood cell dynamics. By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS achieves 25-{\mu}m spatial and 10-ms temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy.

Title: Collaborative QA using Interacting LLMs. Impact of Network Structure, Node Capability and Distributed Data
Authors: Adit Jain, Vikram Krishnamurthy, Yiming Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Title: Two-dimensional Spatial Optimization for Electric Motorcycle Powertrain Elements using Mixed-integer Programming
Authors: Jorn van Kampen, Chun-Cheng Huang, Mauro Salazar
Abstract: This study presents a framework for optimizing the two-dimensional (2D) placement of electric motorcycle powertrain elements, accounting for the position, the orientation and geometric irregularities. Specifically, we construct a 2D placement model at the component level in which we include near-continuous rotation of components and allow for irregular subsystem geometries to make optimal use of the limited design space. Second, we introduce linearization techniques for the trigonometric constraints and formulate the placement problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two electric motorcycle powertrain topologies and study the influence of the geometry complexity on the placement solutions. The results show that gradually increasing complexity leads to more manageable computation times and higher the complexity solution improves handling performance by 2.5% compared to the benchmark placement found in existing electric motorcycles.

Title: Concave Comparison Functions for Accelerating Constrained Lyapunov Decay
Authors: Shuyuan Fan, Guanru Pan, Herbert Werner
Abstract: What limits how fast a Lyapunov function can decay under input bounds? We address this question by showing how the shape of Lyapunov comparison functions governs guaranteed decay for control affine systems. Using a windowed nominal exponential rate together with the endpoint cap induced by actuator limits, we establish a strict ordering: concave comparison functions strictly outperform linear and convex ones, and strict concavity is necessary to improve the best achievable global exponential rate under a fixed endpoint cap. We derive a computable lower bound on the required actuation level for a target nominal rate and show that only concave shaping can reduce this level under the endpoint cap. We then establish a feasibility-preserving acceleration result: whenever a margin exists on a sublevel set, a feasible linear comparison can be replaced by a concave one that preserves feasibility while strictly increasing the guaranteed windowed decay. Finally, we give a tunable rational concave factor with controlled slope that yields a constructive design and integrates with CLF QP, as illustrated by examples.

Title: HyMAD: A Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection Approach for Border Surveillance and Monitoring
Authors: Sriram Srinivasan, Srinivasan Aruchamy, Siva Ram Krisha Vadali
Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

Title: A Sequential Operator-Splitting Framework for Exploration of Nonconvex Trajectory Optimization Solution Spaces
Authors: Justin Ganiban, Natalia Pavlasek, Behcet Acikmese
Abstract: Trajectory optimization methods provide an efficient and reliable means of computing feasible trajectories in nonconvex solution spaces. However, a well-known limitation of these algorithms is that they are inherently local in nature, and typically converge to a solution in the neighborhood of their initial guess. This paper presents a sequential operator-splitting framework, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), aimed at promoting exploration within the sequential convex programming (SCP) framework. In particular, diverse initial solutions are modeled as agents within the consensus ADMM framework. Driving these agents toward consensus facilitates exploration of the nonconvex optimization landscape. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method consistently yields equivalent or lower-cost solutions compared to the standard SCP approach, with the same number of or fewer agents.

Title: Robust Verification of Controllers under State Uncertainty via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis
Authors: Albert Lin, Alessandro Pinto, Somil Bansal
Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

Title: Subjective and Objective Quality Evaluation of Super-Resolution Enhanced Broadcast Images on a Novel SR-IQA Dataset
Authors: Yongrok Kim, Junha Shin, Juhyun Lee, Hyunsuk Ko
Abstract: To display low-quality broadcast content on high-resolution screens in full-screen format, the application of Super-Resolution (SR), a key consumer technology, is essential. Recently, SR methods have been developed that not only increase resolution while preserving the original image information but also enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR images generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast content, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and improvements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original high-quality sources presents another significant challenge. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of research specifically addressing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of SR images under these conditions. In this work, we introduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K resolutions. We conducted a subjective quality evaluation to obtain the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for these SR images and performed a comprehensive human study to identify the key factors influencing the perceived quality. Finally, we evaluated the performance of existing IQA metrics on our dataset. This study reveals the limitations of current metrics, highlighting the need for a more robust IQA metric that better correlates with the perceived quality of SR images.

Title: Lossless optimal transient control for rigid bodies in 3D space
Authors: Riccardo Zanella, Federico Califano, Antonio Franchi, Stefano Stramigioli
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a control scheme for rigid bodies designed to optimise transient behaviors. The search space for the optimal control input is parameterized to yield a passive, specifically lossless, nonlinear feedback controller. As a result, it can be combined with other stabilizing controllers without compromising the stability of the closed-loop system. The controller commands torques generating fictitious gyroscopic effects characteristics of 3D rotational rigid body motions, and as such does not inject nor extract kinetic energy from the system. We validate the controller in simulation using a model predictive control (MPC) scheme, successfully combining stability and performance in a stabilization task with obstacle avoidance constraints.

Title: Trajectory Optimization for Unknown Maneuvering Target Tracking with Bearing-only Measurements
Authors: Yingbo Fu, Ziwen Yang, Liang Xu, Yi Guo, Shanying Zhu, Xinnping Guan
Abstract: This paper studies trajectory optimization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to track an unknown maneuvering target both in the 2D and 3D space. Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called {\it GP-based Bearing-only Tracking (GBT)} is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.

Title: Iterative Explainability for Weakly Supervised Segmentation in Medical PE Detection
Authors: Florin Condrea, Saikiran Rapaka, Marius Leordeanu
Abstract: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) are a leading cause of cardiovascular death. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for PE diagnosis, with growing interest in AI-based diagnostic assistance. However, these algorithms are limited by scarce fine-grained annotations of thromboembolic burden. We address this challenge with iExplain, a weakly supervised learning algorithm that transforms coarse image-level annotations into detailed pixel-level PE masks through iterative model explainability. Our approach generates soft segmentation maps used to mask detected regions, enabling the process to repeat and discover additional embolisms that would be missed in a single pass. This iterative refinement effectively captures complete PE regions and detects multiple distinct embolisms. Models trained on these automatically generated annotations achieve excellent PE detection performance, with significant improvements at each iteration. We demonstrate iExplain's effectiveness on the RSPECT augmented dataset, achieving results comparable to strongly supervised methods while outperforming existing weakly supervised methods.

Title: Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System
Authors: HyunJoong Kim, Jip Kim
Abstract: To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.

Title: Adaptive Beam Broadening for DoA Estimation in Dynamic and Resource-Constrained DFRC Systems
Authors: D.R. Raghavendra, V.V. Reddy, A. Mishra
Abstract: Dual-function radar communication (DFRC) systems incorporate both radar and communication functions by sharing spectrum, hardware and radio frequency (RF) chains. In this work, we consider a conceptual DFRC scheduler model which shares RF chains between radar and communication functions. If such a scheduler is tuned for prioritizing communication performance, the RF chains and time allocated to radar are less and varying. We propose a practical, low-latency and resource-aware technique for sensing the entire field-of-view (FOV) and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in such settings by leveraging time-sliced beam allocation along with adaptive windowing. This results in a balanced cumulative array factor over the FOV thereby ensuring better DoA estimation reliability. Extensive simulation studies show that the technique has consistent target detection and angle estimation performance in all directions and adapts to varying resource availability with time.

Title: Instantaneous Core Loss -- Cycle-by-cycle Modeling of Power Magnetics in PWM DC-AC Converters
Authors: Binyu Cui, Jun Wang, Xibo Yuan, Alfonso Martinez, George Slama, Matthew Wilkowski, Ryosuke Ota, Keiji Wada
Abstract: Nowadays, PWM excitation is one of the most common waveforms seen by magnetic components in power electronic converters. Core loss modelling approaches such as improved Generalized Steinmetz equation (iGSE) or the loss map based on composite waveform hypothesis (CWH) process the PWM excitation piecewisely, which is proven to be effective for DC DC converters. As the additional challenge in PWM DC AC converters, the fundamental-frequency sinewave component induces the "major loop loss" on top of the piecewise high-frequency segments, which however cannot be modelled on a switching cycle basis by any existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fundamental concept, instantaneous core loss, which is the time-domain core loss observed experimentally for the first time in history. Extending the reactive voltage cancellation concept, this work presents a method to measure the instantaneous core loss, which only contains real power loss, as a function of time. Based on measurements in evaluated soft magnetic components, it was discovered that the discharging stage exhibits higher core loss than the charging stage. A modelling approach is then proposed to break down the major loop core loss, typically an average value in the literature, into the time domain to enable cycle-by-cycle modelling of core losses in PWM converters. This work enhances the fundamental understanding of the core loss process by moving from the average model to the time-domain model.

Title: Frequency Diverse Array OFDM Transmit System with Partial Overlap in Frequency
Authors: Marcin Wachowiak, André Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: A frequency-diverse array (FDA) is an alternative array architecture in which each antenna is preceded by a mixer instead of a phase shifter. The mixers introduce a frequency offset between signals transmitted by each antenna, resulting in a time-varying beam pattern. However, time-dependent beamforming is not desirable for communication or sensing. In this paper, the FDA is combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The proposed beamforming method partitions the OFDM symbol transmitted by all antennas into subcarrier blocks, which carry the same data but are precoded differently. The frequency offset between the antennas is equal to the subcarrier block width. Consequently, each antenna transmits a differently precoded subcarrier block at the center frequency, resulting in overlap and coherent summation of the blocks. Proposed architecture enables fully digital beamforming over a single block while requiring only a single digital-to-analog converter. The system's performance and tradeoffs are investigated in the context of joint communication and sensing.

Title: Towards Prospective Medical Image Reconstruction via Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport
Authors: Taoran Zheng, Yan Yang, Xing Li, Xiang Gu, Jian Sun, Zongben Xu
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

Title: Cooperative Bistatic ISAC Systems for Low-Altitude Economy
Authors: Zhenkun Zhang, Yining Xu, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Qixuan Zhang, Songtao Gao, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: The burgeoning low-altitude economy (LAE) necessitates integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems capable of high-accuracy multi-target localization and velocity estimation under hardware and coverage constraints inherent in conventional ISAC architectures. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a cooperative bistatic ISAC framework within MIMO-OFDM cellular networks, enabling robust sensing services for LAE applications through standardized 5G New Radio (NR) infrastructure. We first develop a low-complexity parameter extraction algorithm employing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition, which exploits the inherent Vandermonde structure in delay-related factor matrices to efficiently recover bistatic ranges, Doppler velocities, and angles-of-arrival (AoA) from multi-dimensional received signal tensors. To resolve data association ambiguity across distributed transmitter-receiver pairs and mitigate erroneous estimates, we further design a robust fusion scheme based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) method, enabling joint 3D position and velocity reconstruction. Comprehensive simulation results validate the framework's superiority in computational efficiency and sensing performance for low-altitude scenarios.

Title: Sizing Antenna Arrays for Near-field Communication and Sensing
Authors: Marcin Wachowiak, André Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and sensing systems and their scaling behavior as a function of the antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard array geometries to ease the design of the large antenna arrays under given system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Moreover, when considering a region where the beamfocusing resolution does not exceed a specified threshold, the extent of the region is also shown to scale linearly with the array size. Finally, the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array's broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications.

Title: Identifiability and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for System Identification of Networks of Dynamical Systems
Authors: Anders Hansson, João Victor Galvão da Mata, Martin S. Andersen
Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gröbner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.

Title: Identifying the Smallest Adversarial Load Perturbation that Renders DC-OPF Infeasible
Authors: Samuel Chevalier, William A. Wheeler
Abstract: What is the globally smallest load perturbation that renders DC-OPF infeasible? Reliably identifying such "adversarial attack" perturbations has useful applications in a variety of emerging grid-related contexts, including machine learning performance verification, cybersecurity, and operational robustness of power systems dominated by stochastic renewable energy resources. In this paper, we formulate the inherently nonconvex adversarial attack problem by applying a parameterized version of Farkas' lemma to a perturbed set of DC-OPF equations. Since the resulting formulation is very hard to globally optimize, we also propose a parameterized generation control policy which, when applied to the primal DC-OPF problem, provides solvability guarantees. Together, these nonconvex problems provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds on adversarial attack size; by combining them into a single optimization problem, we can efficiently "squeeze" these bounds towards a common global solution. We apply these methods on a range of small- to medium-sized test cases from PGLib, benchmarking our results against the best adversarial attack lower bounds provided by Gurobi 12.0's spatial Branch and Bound solver.

Title: DeSamba: Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Framework for 3D Multi-Sequence MRI Lesion Classification
Authors: Dezhen Wang, Sheng Miao, Rongxin Chai, Jiufa Cui
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction, and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet, enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1 accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over 10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.

Title: Concentration inequalities for semidefinite least squares based on data
Authors: Filippo Fabiani, Andrea Simonetto
Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

Title: Functional WMMSE Algorithm for Multiuser Continuous Aperture Array Systems
Authors: Shiyong Chen, Shengqian Han, Jia Guo
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a functional weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm for downlink beamforming in multiuser continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems where both the base station (BS) and users are equipped with CAPAs. We first present a closed-form expression for the achievable rate in multiuser CAPA systems, based on which the equivalence between maximizing the sum rate and minimizing the sum of weighted mean-squared errors (MSE) is established. We then employ the orthonormal basis expansion to transform the formulated functional optimization problem into a parameter optimization problem. By deriving the first-order optimality conditions of the parameter optimization problem and mapping them back to the functional domain, we obtain the update equations of the proposed functional WMMSE algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms discretization-based baselines in both sum rate and computational complexity.

Title: Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets
Authors: Tony Lindeberg
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal. This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel. By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals. We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.

Title: Strategic Data Center Load Shifting: Implications for Market Efficiency and Transmission Value
Authors: Aron Brenner, Line Roald, Saurabh Amin
Abstract: Data center electricity use may reach 12% of U.S. demand by 2030, alongside growing ability to shift workloads geographically in response to prices or carbon signals. We examine the system-level implications of such strategic flexibility using a bilevel two-zone model that couples economic dispatch with consumer cost minimization. Two market failures emerge. First, discontinuous price changes at generator capacity limits can induce flexible consumers to shift load in socially inefficient directions-for example, toward a higher-cost region to trigger a price drop elsewhere. Second, by positioning near capacity boundaries, consumers can eliminate the marginal value of transmission expansion: although shadow prices suggest additional capacity is valuable, consumers reoptimize to offset resulting flow changes, leaving dispatch and costs unchanged. We derive conditions under which these effects arise and show that conventional price signals and planning methods can misrepresent system value in the presence of large flexible loads.

Title: Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Multiplicative Uncertainties
Authors: Renato Quartullo, Andrea Garulli, Mirko Leomanni
Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.

Title: Kalman-Bucy Filtering with Randomized Sensing: Fundamental Limits and Sensor Network Design for Field Estimation
Authors: Xinyi Wang, Devansh R. Agrawal, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Stability analysis of the Kalman filter under randomly lost measurements has been widely studied. We revisit this problem in a general continuous-time framework, where both the measurement matrix and noise covariance evolve as random processes, capturing variability in sensing locations. Within this setting, we derive a closed-form upper bound on the expected estimation covariance for continuous-time Kalman filtering. We then apply this framework to spatiotemporal field estimation, where the field is modeled as a Gaussian process observed by randomly located, noisy sensors. Using clarity, introduced in our earlier work as a rescaled form of the differential entropy of a random variable, we establish a grid-independent lower bound on the spatially averaged expected clarity. This result exposes fundamental performance limits through a composite sensing parameter that jointly captures the effects of the number of sensors, noise level, and measurement frequency. Simulations confirm that the proposed bound is tight for the discrete-time Kalman filter, approaching it as the measurement rate decreases, while avoiding the recursive computations required in the discrete-time formulation. Most importantly, the derived limits provide principled and efficient guidelines for sensor network design problem prior to deployment.

Title: Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids
Authors: Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala, Lei Wu, Panos J. Antsaklis
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs). Unlike existing methods that treat control synthesis and topology design separately, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously optimizes both aspects to achieve voltage and frequency regulation and proportional power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). We formulate the closed-loop AC MG as a networked system where DGs, distribution lines, and loads are interconnected subsystems characterized by their dissipative properties. Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.

Title: Neural Directional Filtering Using a Compact Microphone Array
Authors: Weilong Huang, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli, Mhd Modar Halimeh, Oliver Thiergart, Emanuël A. P. Habets
Abstract: Beamforming with desired directivity patterns using compact microphone arrays is essential in many audio applications. Directivity patterns achievable using traditional beamformers depend on the number of microphones and the array aperture. Generally, their effectiveness degrades for compact arrays. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural directional filtering (NDF) approach that leverages deep neural networks to enable sound capture with a predefined directivity pattern. The NDF computes a single-channel complex mask from the microphone array signals, which is then applied to a reference microphone to produce an output that approximates a virtual directional microphone with the desired directivity pattern. We introduce training strategies and propose data-dependent metrics to evaluate the directivity pattern and directivity factor. We show that the proposed method: i) achieves a frequency-invariant directivity pattern even above the spatial aliasing frequency, ii) can approximate diverse and higher-order patterns, iii) can steer the pattern in different directions, and iv) generalizes to unseen conditions. Lastly, experimental comparisons demonstrate superior performance over conventional beamforming and parametric approaches.

Title: Statistically Consistent Approximate Model Predictive Control
Authors: Elias Milios, Kim P. Wabersich, Felix Berkel, Felix Gruber, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective. This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.

Title: Artifacts Are Not Noise: Embodied Resonance and the 70% Signal Loss in Conventional EEG
Authors: Ahmed Gamal Eldin
Abstract: Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition but fail at causal reasoning. We argue this is not an engineering limitation but reveals something fundamental about the nature of understanding itself. We propose that causal cognition requires a specific physical architecture: stochastic, coupled oscillators with whole-system coordination. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500 plus trials) from a P300 target recognition task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization and compared it to standard voltage (ERP) and coherence (ITC) metrics. Four findings establish the framework. Phase and voltage are globally independent (r of 0.048) yet strongly trial-coupled (r of 0.590), proving R captures hidden cognitive structure. Voltage precedes phase by 293 ms, revealing sequential computation. Frequency decomposition shows Theta (169 ms), Alpha (286 ms), and Beta (777 ms) cascade. Our metric is distinct from standard ITC (r of 0.155). Then we tested the standard assumption. Conventional artifact rejection removes eye movements, muscle activity, and autonomic signals before analysis. The standard model assumes cognition is neural activity plus noise. We ran the identical analysis with and without rejection. Removing artifacts reduced the trial-level correlation threefold (from 0.590 to 0.195). Target discrimination reversed sign (from positive 0.6 percent to negative 0.4 percent). What we discard as noise is 70 percent of the signal. This falsifies the standard model. Cognition is not isolated neural computation. It is whole-body phase synchronization spanning neural, muscular, and autonomic systems. For AI, the implications are direct: embodied sensorimotor integration is not optional. It is the substrate that makes understanding possible.

Title: cryoSENSE: Compressive Sensing Enables High-throughput Microscopy with Sparse and Generative Priors on the Protein Cryo-EM Image Manifold
Authors: Zain Shabeeb, Daniel Saeedi, Darin Tsui, Vida Jamali, Amirali Aghazadeh
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the atomic-resolution visualization of biomolecules; however, modern direct detectors generate data volumes that far exceed the available storage and transfer bandwidth, thereby constraining practical throughput. We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.

Title: Systematic Evaluation of Time-Frequency Features for Binaural Sound Source Localization
Authors: Davoud Shariat Panah, Alessandro Ragano, Dan Barry, Jan Skoglund, Andrew Hines
Abstract: This study presents a systematic evaluation of time-frequency feature design for binaural sound source localization (SSL), focusing on how feature selection influences model performance across diverse conditions. We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using various combinations of amplitude-based features (magnitude spectrogram, interaural level difference - ILD) and phase-based features (phase spectrogram, interaural phase difference - IPD). Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain data with mismatched head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) reveal that carefully chosen feature combinations often outperform increases in model complexity. While two-feature sets such as ILD + IPD are sufficient for in-domain SSL, generalization to diverse content requires richer inputs combining channel spectrograms with both ILD and IPD. Using the optimal feature sets, our low-complexity CNN model achieves competitive performance. Our findings underscore the importance of feature design in binaural SSL and provide practical guidance for both domain-specific and general-purpose localization.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlinear Output Regulation
Authors: Sebastiano Mengozzi, Giovanni B. Esposito, Michelangelo Bin, Andrea Acquaviva, Andrea Bartolini, Lorenzo Marconi
Abstract: This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold $\pi(w)$ and a feedforward input $c(w)$ that render such manifold invariant. The pair $(\pi(w), c(w))$ is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates $\pi(w)$ and $c(w)$ by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem.

Title: Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Yuto Watanabe, Sotaro Fushimi, Kazunori Sakurama
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As structural constraints on a control gain result in non-convexity in general, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions with the same sparsity pattern as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a nonlinear matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As its relaxation, we derive novel LMIs, one of which strictly covers the conventional relaxation, and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.

Title: Joint Communication and Over-the-Air Computation for Semi-Federated Learning Towards Scalable AI in Computing-Heterogeneous IoT Systems
Authors: Wanli Ni, Hui Tian
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems demands scalable artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that can operate in computing-heterogeneous environments with diverse hardware capabilities and non-independent and identically distributed data. This paper proposes a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) framework that integrates centralized learning (CL) and federated learning (FL) to enable efficient model training across heterogeneous IoT devices. In SemiFL, only devices with sufficient computational resources are designated for local model training (referred to as FL users), while the remaining devices transmit raw data to a base station (BS) for remote computation (referred to as CL users). This collaborative computing framework enables all IoT devices to participate in global model training, regardless of their computational capabilities and data distributions. Furthermore, to alleviate radio resource scarcity of SemiFL, we propose a joint communication and over-the-air computation design that unifies wireless transmission and model aggregation. This approach reduces latency and enhances spectrum efficiency by allowing simultaneous communication and computation over the air. Furthermore, we design a transceiver architecture that integrates receive beamforming and successive interference cancellation to mitigate multi-user interference, ensuring reliable aggregation at the BS. Subsequently, two scenarios are examined to assess the efficacy of SemiFL within IoT systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed next-generation multiple access (NGMA)-based SemiFL outperforms the fixed beamforming-based FL by 8% and the AirComp-based FL by 6.4%, demonstrating its superior learning efficiency and convergence performance.

Title: Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension
Authors: Zhen Qin, Casey Jameson, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhexuan Gong, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.

Title: Environmental Feature Engineering and Statistical Validation for ML-Based Path Loss Prediction
Authors: Jonathan Ethier, Mathieu Chateauvert, Ryan G. Dempsey, Alexis Bose
Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.

Title: Mobile Jamming Mitigation in 5G Networks: A MUSIC-Based Adaptive Beamforming Approach
Authors: Olivia Holguin, Rachel Donati, Seyed bagher Hashemi Natanzi, Bo Tang
Abstract: Mobile jammers pose a critical threat to 5G networks, particularly in military communications. We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.

Title: Communication-Efficient Distributed Online Nonconvex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints
Authors: Kunpeng Zhang, Lei Xu, Xinlei Yi, Guanghui Wen, Ming Cao, Karl H. Johansson, Tianyou Chai, Tao Yang
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where the nonconvex local loss and convex local constraint functions can vary arbitrarily across iterations. For a time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Moreover, the network cumulative constraint violation bounds are reduced under Slater's condition. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.

Title: Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System
Authors: Simón Martínez-Rozas, David Alejo, José Javier Carpio, Fernando Caballero, Luis Merino
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. Our work details the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describes our full-stack software framework used by the system, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three sets of field experiments involving (i) three manual flight endurance tests to estimate the operational duration, (ii) three experiments for validating the localization and the trajectory tracking systems, and (iii) three executions of an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. The results of the experiments confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system in GNSS-denied environments. Finally, all experimental data have been made publicly available to support reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

Title: Hidden in the Noise: Unveiling Backdoors in Audio LLMs Alignment through Latent Acoustic Pattern Triggers
Authors: Liang Lin, Miao Yu, Kaiwen Luo, Yibo Zhang, Lilan Peng, Dexian Wang, Xuehai Tang, Yuanhe Zhang, Xikang Yang, Zhenhong Zhou, Kun Wang, Yang Liu
Abstract: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates: Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features. HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise. These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II) ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features, particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III) poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations, highlighting the attack's stealth.

Title: Combining High Level Scheduling and Low Level Control to Manage Fleets of Mobile Robots
Authors: Sabino Francesco Roselli, Ze Zhang, Knut Åkesson
Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

Title: MusRec: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Rectified Flow and Diffusion Transformers
Authors: Ali Boudaghi, Hadi Zare
Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences. However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true zero-shot capability. leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, a zero-shot text-to-music editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.

Title: Melodia: Training-Free Music Editing Guided by Attention Probing in Diffusion Models
Authors: Yi Yang, Haowen Li, Tianxiang Li, Boyu Cao, Xiaohan Zhang, Liqun Chen, Qi Liu
Abstract: Text-to-music generation technology is progressing rapidly, creating new opportunities for musical composition and editing. However, existing music editing methods often fail to preserve the source music's temporal structure, including melody and rhythm, when altering particular attributes like instrument, genre, and mood. To address this challenge, this paper conducts an in-depth probing analysis on attention maps within AudioLDM 2, a diffusion-based model commonly used as the backbone for existing music editing methods. We reveal a key finding: cross-attention maps encompass details regarding distinct musical characteristics, and interventions on these maps frequently result in ineffective modifications. In contrast, self-attention maps are essential for preserving the temporal structure of the source music during its conversion into the target music. Building upon this understanding, we present Melodia, a training-free technique that selectively manipulates self-attention maps in particular layers during the denoising process and leverages an attention repository to store source music information, achieving accurate modification of musical characteristics while preserving the original structure without requiring textual descriptions of the source music. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to better evaluate music editing methods. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of textual adherence and structural integrity across various datasets. This research enhances comprehension of internal mechanisms within music generation models and provides improved control for music creation.

Title: On topological properties of closed attractors
Authors: Wouter Jongeneel
Abstract: The notion of an attractor has various definitions in the theory of dynamical systems. Under compactness assumptions, several of those definitions coincide and the theory is rather complete. However, without compactness, the picture becomes blurry. To improve our understanding, we characterize in this work when a closed, not necessarily compact, asymptotically stable attractor on a locally compact metric space is homotopy equivalent to its domain of attraction. This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem.

Title: Design of A Low-Latency and Parallelizable SVD Dataflow Architecture on FPGA
Authors: Fangqiang Du, Sixuan Chong, Zixuan Huang, Rui Qin, Fengnan Mi, Caibao Hu, Jiangang Chen
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and noise suppression, and it plays a pivotal role in numerous scientific and engineering applications. As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems,especially in time-sensitive scenarios with large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this express, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams. Compared with previous works, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces on-chip RAM consumption by 41.5 percent and improves computational efficiency by 23 times.
