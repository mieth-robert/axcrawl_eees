Title: Identification of a Kalman filter: consistency of local solutions
Authors: Léo Simpson, Moritz Diehl
Abstract: Prediction error and maximum likelihood methods are powerful tools for identifying linear dynamical systems and, in particular, enable the joint estimation of model parameters and the Kalman filter used for state estimation. A key limitation, however, is that these methods require solving a generally non-convex optimization problem to global optimality. This paper analyzes the statistical behavior of local minimizers in the special case where only the Kalman gain is estimated. We prove that these local solutions are statistically consistent estimates of the true Kalman gain. This follows from asymptotic unimodularity: as the dataset grows, the objective function converges to a limit with a unique local (and therefore global) minimizer. We further provide guidelines for designing the optimization problem for Kalman filter tuning and discuss extensions to the joint estimation of additional linear parameters and noise covariances. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of increasing complexity. The main practical takeaway of this paper is that difficulties caused by local minimizers in system identification are, at least, not attributable to the tuning of the Kalman gain.

Title: Towards Radar-Agnostic Gait Analysis Across UWB and FMCW Systems
Authors: Charalambos Hadjipanayi, Maowen Yin, Alan Bannon, Ziwei Chen, Timothy G. Constandinou
Abstract: Radar sensing has emerged in recent years as a promising solution for unobtrusive and continuous in-home gait monitoring. This study evaluates whether a unified processing framework can be applied to radar-based spatiotemporal gait analysis independent of radar modality. The framework is validated using collocated impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars under identical processing settings, without modality-specific tuning, during repeated overground walking trials with 10 healthy participants. A modality-independent approach for automatic walking-segment identification is also introduced to ensure fair and reproducible modality performance assessment. Clinically relevant spatiotemporal gait parameters, including stride time, stride length, walking speed, swing time, and stance time, extracted from each modality were compared against gold-standard motion capture reference estimates. Across all parameters, both radar modalities achieved comparably high mean estimation accuracy in the range of 85-98%, with inter-modality differences remaining below 4.1%, resulting in highly overlapping accuracy distributions. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses revealed minimal bias, comparable limits of agreement, and strong agreement with reference estimates, while intraclass correlation analysis demonstrated high consistency between radar modalities. These findings indicate that no practically meaningful performance differences arise from radar modality when using a shared processing framework, supporting the feasibility of radar-agnostic gait analysis systems.

Title: Latent-Level Enhancement with Flow Matching for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Da-Hee Yang, Joon-Hyuk Chang
Abstract: Noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been commonly addressed by applying speech enhancement (SE) at the waveform level before recognition. However, speech-level enhancement does not always translate into consistent recognition improvements due to residual distortions and mismatches with the latent space of the ASR encoder. In this letter, we introduce a complementary strategy termed latent-level enhancement, where distorted representations are refined during ASR inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Flow Matching Refinement module (FM-Refiner) that operates on the output latents of a pretrained CTC-based ASR encoder. Trained to map imperfect latents-either directly from noisy inputs or from enhanced-but-imperfect speech-toward their clean counterparts, the FM-Refiner is applied only at inference, without fine-tuning ASR parameters. Experiments show that FM-Refiner consistently reduces word error rate, both when directly applied to noisy inputs and when combined with conventional SE front-ends. These results demonstrate that latent-level refinement via flow matching provides a lightweight and effective complement to existing SE approaches for robust ASR.

Title: Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning
Authors: Shadeeb Hossain
Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.

Title: Invisible Walls: Privacy-Preserving ISAC Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Yinghui He (1), Long Fan (2), Lei Xie (2), Dusit Niyato (1), Chau Yuen (1), Jun Luo (1) ((1) Nanyang Technological University, (2) Nanjing University)
Abstract: The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.

Title: Definition and Formulation of Inertia Service Incorporating Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: Sojin Park, Ross Baldick, Hunyoung Shin
Abstract: Increasing concerns over the scarcity of inertia have motivated the procurement of inertia as an ancillary service (AS). Despite numerous academic and practical efforts, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and treatment of inertia service in market operations, particularly the specification of inertia variables and the separation between synchronous inertia (SI) from synchronous generators and virtual inertia (VI) from inverter-based resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a power-oriented (P-oriented) definition based on inertial response, which establishes conceptual consistency between SI and VI and makes the inertia service commensurable with other ASs. This definition explicitly incorporates both positive and negative inertial responses during frequency drop events. We then formulate a security-constrained economic dispatch framework based on this P-oriented definition and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through simulations. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed bidirectional service definition ensures price signals that reflect the economic value of inertial provision.

Title: Spectral point transformer for significant wave height estimation from sea clutter
Authors: Yi Zhou, Li Wang, Hang Su, Tian Wang
Abstract: This paper presents a method for estimating significant wave height (Hs) from sparse S_pectral P_oint using a T_ransformer-based approach (SPT). Based on empirical observations that only a minority of spectral points with strong power contribute to wave energy, the proposed SPT effectively integrates geometric and spectral characteristics of ocean surface waves to estimate Hs through multi-dimensional feature representation. The experiment reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the learned features of SPT align well with physical dispersion relations, where the contribution-score map of selected points is concentrated along dispersion curves. Compared to conventional vision networks that process image sequences and full spectra, SPT demonstrates superior performance in Hs regression while consuming significantly fewer computational resources. On a consumer-grade GPU, SPT completes the training of regression model for 1080 sea clutter image sequences within 4 minutes, showcasing its potential to reduce deployment costs for radar wave-measuring systems. The open-source implementation of SPT will be available at this https URL

Title: MIMO Beam Map Reconstruction via Toeplitz-Structured Matrix-Vector Tensor Decomposition
Authors: Hao Sun, Junting Chen, Xianghao Yu
Abstract: As wireless networks progress toward sixthgeneration (6G), understanding the spatial distribution of directional beam coverage becomes increasingly important for beam management and link optimization. Multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) beam map provides such spatial awareness, yet accurate construction under sparse measurements remains difficult due to incomplete spatial coverage and strong angular variations. This paper presents a tensor decomposition approach for reconstructing MIMO beam map from limited measurements. By transforming measurements from a Cartesian coordinate system into a polar coordinate system, we uncover a matrix-vector outer-product structure associated with different propagation conditions. Specifically, we mathematically demonstrate that the matrix factor, representing beam-space gain, exhibits an intrinsic Toeplitz structure due to the shift-invariant nature of array responses, and the vector factor captures distance-dependent attenuation. Leveraging these structural priors, we formulate a regularized tensor decomposition problem to jointly reconstruct line-of-sight (LOS), reflection, and obstruction propagation conditions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency, achieving a normalized mean square error (NMSE) reduction of over 20% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, even under sparse sampling regimes.

Title: LLMs-Integrated Automatic Hate Speech Recognition Using Controllable Text Generation Models
Authors: Ryutaro Oshima, Yuya Hosoda, Youji Iiguni
Abstract: This paper proposes an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for hate speech using large language models (LLMs). The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.

Title: Towards a Unified Theoretical Framework for Self-Supervised MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Siying Xu, Kerstin Hammernik, Daniel Rueckert, Sergios Gatidis, Thomas Küstner
Abstract: The demand for high-resolution, non-invasive imaging continues to drive innovation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet prolonged acquisition times hinder accessibility and real-time applications. While deep learning-based reconstruction methods have accelerated MRI, their predominant supervised paradigm depends on fully-sampled reference data that are challenging to acquire. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have emerged as promising alternatives, but most are empirically designed and fragmented. Therefore, we introduce UNITS (Unified Theory for Self-supervision), a general framework for self-supervised MRI reconstruction. UNITS unifies prior SSL strategies within a common formalism, enabling consistent interpretation and systematic benchmarking. We prove that SSL can achieve the same expected performance as supervised learning. Under this theoretical guarantee, we introduce sampling stochasticity and flexible data utilization, which improve network generalization under out-of-domain distributions and stabilize training. Together, these contributions establish UNITS as a theoretical foundation and a practical paradigm for interpretable, generalizable, and clinically applicable self-supervised MRI reconstruction.

Title: Matrix-Valued Passivity Indices: Foundations, Properties, and Stability Implications
Authors: Xi Ru, Xiaoyu Peng, Xinghua Chen, Zhaojian Wang, Peng Yang, Feng Liu
Abstract: The passivity index, a quantitative measure of a system's passivity deficiency or excess, has been widely used in stability analysis and control. Existing studies mostly rely on scalar forms of indices, which are restrictive for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems. This paper extends the classical scalar indices to a systematic matrix-valued framework, referred to as passivity matrices. A broad range of classical results in passivity theory can be naturally generalized in this framework. We first show that, under the matrix representation, passivity indices essentially correspond to the curvature of the dissipativity functional under a second-variation interpretation. This result reveals that the intrinsic geometric structure of passivity consists of its directions and intensities, which a scalar index cannot fully capture. For linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, we examine the structural properties of passivity matrices with respect to the Loewner partial order and propose two principled criteria for selecting representative matrices. Compared with conventional scalar indices, the matrix-valued indices capture the passivity coupling among different input-output channels in MIMO systems and provide a more comprehensive description of system passivity. This richer information leads to lower passivation effort and less conservative stability assessment.

Abstract: The sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) can play a central role in shaping a sustainable future, the most compelling contemporary challenge. Connecting the unconnected, reducing carbon emissions of vertical sectors, and allowing heterogeneous types of intelligence (including humans) to safely and constructively interact in complex environments, are only a few of the several challenges that can be supported by 6G. However, this requires a careful design that balances positive and negative impacts of 6G, towards a sustainable and sustainability-enabling technology. This paper presents a holistic view that translates the complex interplay between the 6G enabling effects and the sustainability of 6G by design, into concrete trade-offs and research questions. Starting from today's challenges for society and associated key values, we unfold the dilemma into a set of technical trade-offs, whose solutions span from technological innovations to standardization actions towards applicability.

Title: An Ultra-Fast MLE for Low SNR Multi-Reference Alignment
Authors: Shay Kreymer, Amnon Balanov, Tamir Bendory
Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, multi-reference alignment (MRA) models the task of recovering an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations corrupted by random rotations. The standard approach, expectation-maximization (EM), often becomes computationally prohibitive, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. We introduce an alternative, ultra-fast algorithm for MRA over the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$. By performing a Taylor expansion of the log-likelihood in the low-SNR regime, we estimate the signal by sequentially computing data-driven averages of observations. Our method requires only one pass over the data, dramatically reducing computational cost compared to EM. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in low-SNR environments and provides an excellent initialization for subsequent EM refinement.

Title: SE-EE Tradeoff in Pinching-Antenna Systems: Waveguide Multiplexing or Waveguide Switching?
Authors: Guangyu Zhu, Xidong Mu, Li Guo, Shibiao Xu, Yuanwei Liu, Naofal Al-Dhahir
Abstract: The spectral and energy efficiency (SE-EE) trade-off in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is investigated in this paper. In particular, two practical operating protocols, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM) and waveguide switching (WS), are considered. A multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to jointly optimize the baseband and pinching beamforming for maximizing the achievable SE and EE, which is then converted into a single-objective problem via the {\epsilon}-constraint method. For WM, the problem is decomposed within the alternating-optimization framework, where the baseband beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation, and the pinching beamforming is updated through the particle swarm optimization. For WS, due to the time-division transmission and interference-free nature, the pinching beamforming in each time slot is first adjusted to maximize the served user channel gain, followed by the baseband power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) PASS outperforms conventional antennas by mitigating large-scale path losses; 2) WS leads to a higher maximum achievable EE by activating a single RF chain, whereas WM yields a higher SE upper bound by serving all users concurrently; and 3) increasing the number of users substantially enhances SE under WM, whereas WS shows more pronounced benefits in low-signal-to-noise ratio regimes.

Title: Gradient-based Optimisation of Modulation Effects
Authors: Alistair Carson, Alec Wright, Stefan Bilbao
Abstract: Modulation effects such as phasers, flangers and chorus effects are heavily used in conjunction with the electric guitar. Machine learning based emulation of analog modulation units has been investigated in recent years, but most methods have either been limited to one class of effect or suffer from a high computational cost or latency compared to canonical digital implementations. Here, we build on previous work and present a framework for modelling flanger, chorus and phaser effects based on differentiable digital signal processing. The model is trained in the time-frequency domain, but at inference operates in the time-domain, requiring zero latency. We investigate the challenges associated with gradient-based optimisation of such effects, and show that low-frequency weighting of loss functions avoids convergence to local minima when learning delay times. We show that when trained against analog effects units, sound output from the model is in some cases perceptually indistinguishable from the reference, but challenges still remain for effects with long delay times and feedback.

Title: Safe Reinforcement Learning Beyond Baseline Control: A Hierarchical Framework for Space Triangle Tethered Formation System
Authors: Xinyi Tao, Panfeng Huang, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Triangular tethered formation system (TTFS) provide a promising platform for deep space exploration and distributed sensing due to its intrinsic spatial-orientation stability and capability of adjusting distances among node satellites through deployment and retrieval of tethers. However, due to the coupled tether-satellite dynamics and disturbance sensitivity of TTFS, traditional control methods struggle to achieve a balanced trade-off among configuration accuracy requirements, tension constraints, and energy efficiency consumption throughout the deployment this http URL this paper, a novel model-reference reinforcement learning control framework is proposed for TTFS. By integrating baseline model-based control with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) compensator, the proposed method simultaneously achieves high-precision tracking, fuel efficiency, and compliance with tension limits. A hierarchical training scheme is developed to address the convergence difficulties arising from strongly coupled states in centralized training, while tailored reward functions, reset conditions, and normalization criteria are designed to accelerate training convergence. Closed-loop stability of the overall control law is rigorously proven using Lyapunov methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller reduces steady-state tracking errors by over 96% for tethers and 99% for node satellites, while cutting fuel consumption by two orders of magnitude compared with the baseline method. These results validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach for TTFS deployment control.

Title: 6D Movable Antenna Enhanced Cell-free MIMO: Two-timescale Decentralized Beamforming and Antenna Movement Optimization
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Yuchen Zhang, Wenyan Ma, Lipeng Zhu, Jianquan Wang, Wanbin Tang, Rui Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided cell-free multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. In this system, each distributed access point (AP) can flexibly adjust its array orientation and antenna positions to adapt to spatial channel variations and enhance communication performance. However, frequent antenna movements and centralized beamforming based on global instantaneous channel state information (CSI) sharing among APs entail extremely high signal processing delay and system overhead, which is difficult to be practically implemented in high-mobility scenarios with short channel coherence time. To address these practical implementation challenges and improve scalability, a two-timescale decentralized optimization framework is proposed in this paper to jointly design the beamformer, antenna positions, and array orientations. In the short timescale, each AP updates its receive beamformer based on local instantaneous CSI and global statistical CSI. In the long timescale, the central processing unit optimizes the antenna positions and array orientations at all APs based on global statistical CSI to maximize the ergodic sum rate of all users. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, thus posing significant challenges for obtaining efficient solutions. To address this problem, a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation algorithm is developed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided cell-free system with decentralized beamforming significantly outperforms other antenna movement schemes with less flexibility and even achieves a performance comparable to that of the centralized beamforming benchmark.

Title: Scalable neural pushbroom architectures for real-time denoising of hyperspectral images onboard satellites
Authors: Ziyao Yi, Davide Piccinini, Diego Valsesia, Tiziano Bianchi, Enrico Magli
Abstract: The next generation of Earth observation satellites will seek to deploy intelligent models directly onboard the payload in order to minimize the latency incurred by the transmission and processing chain of the ground segment, for time-critical applications. Designing neural architectures for onboard execution, particularly for satellite-based hyperspectral imagers, poses novel challenges due to the unique constraints of this environment and imaging system that are largely unexplored by the traditional computer vision literature. In this paper, we show that this setting requires addressing three competing objectives, namely high-quality inference with low complexity, dynamic power scalability and fault tolerance. We focus on the problem of hyperspectral image denoising, which is a critical task to enable effective downstream inference, and highlights the constraints of the onboard processing scenario. We propose a neural network design that addresses the three aforementioned objectives with several novel contributions. In particular, we propose a mixture of denoisers that can be resilient to radiation-induced faults as well as allowing for time-varying power scaling. Moreover, each denoiser employs an innovative architecture where an image is processed line-by-line in a causal way, with a memory of past lines, in order to match the acquisition process of pushbroom hyperspectral sensors and greatly limit memory requirements. We show that the proposed architecture can run in real-time, i.e., process one line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware and provide competitive denoising quality with respect to significantly more complex state-of-the-art models. We also show that the power scalability and fault tolerance objectives provide a design space with multiple tradeoffs between those properties and denoising quality.

Title: On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems
Authors: Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.

Title: Effect of Dispatch Decisions on Small-Signal Stability of Converter-Dominated Power Systems
Authors: Maitraya Avadhut Desai, Ognjen Stanojev, Simon Muntwiler, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: Small-signal stability of modern converter-dominated power systems has been the subject of extensive research, particularly from the perspective of device-level control design for grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) converters. However, the influence of power flow variables on system stability has received limited attention. Conventional small-signal stability analyses are typically conducted at a specific operating point, emphasizing the selection of control or system design parameters while neglecting the sensitivity of stability characteristics to operating conditions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by systematically investigating the impact of dispatch decisions on the small-signal stability of converter-based power systems. Our findings are first illustrated on a three-bus system and then validated on the standard IEEE 39-bus test system to demonstrate scalability. Across the test systems, we find that high-voltage capacitive operation of GFL converters limits its active power injection, whereas inductive operation permits higher injections, and it is generally preferable for the GFM converter to supply more active power.

Title: Online Bayesian Learning of Agent Behavior in Differential Games
Authors: Francesco Bianchin, Robert Lefringhausen, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: This work introduces an online Bayesian game-theoretic method for behavior identification in multi-agent dynamical systems. By casting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman optimality conditions as linear-in-parameter residuals, the method enables fast sequential Bayesian updates, uncertainty-aware inference, and robust prediction from limited, noisy data-without history stacks. The approach accommodates nonlinear dynamics and nonquadratic value functions through basis expansions, providing flexible models. Experiments, including linear-quadratic and nonlinear shared-control scenarios, demonstrate accurate prediction with quantified uncertainty, highlighting the method's relevance for adaptive interaction and real-time decision making.

Title: Multi-band Carrier Phase Positioning toward 6G: Performance Bounds and Efficient Estimators
Authors: Ehsan Shourezari, Ossi Kaltiokallio, Mehmet C. Ilter, Jukka Talvitie, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Henk Wymeersch, Mikko Valkama
Abstract: In addition to satellite systems, carrier phase positioning (CPP) is gaining attraction also in terrestrial mobile networks, particularly in 5G New Radio evolution toward 6G. One key challenge is to resolve the integer ambiguity problem, as the carrier phase provides only relative position information. This work introduces and studies a multi-band CPP scenario with intra- and inter-band carrier aggregation (CA) opportunities across FR1, mmWave-FR2, and emerging 6G FR3 bands. Specifically, we derive multi-band CPP performance bounds, showcasing the superiority of multi-band CPP for high-precision localization in current and future mobile networks, while noting also practical imperfections such as clock offsets between the user equipment (UE) and the network as well as mutual clock imperfections between the network nodes. A wide collection of numerical results is provided, covering the impacts of the available carrier bandwidth, number of aggregated carriers, transmit power, and the number of network nodes or base stations. The offered results highlight that only two carriers suffice to substantially facilitate resolving the integer ambiguity problem while also largely enhancing the robustness of positioning against imperfections imposed by the network-side clocks and multi-path propagation. In addition, we also propose a two-stage practical estimator that achieves the derived bounds under all realistic bandwidth and transmit power conditions. Furthermore, we show that with an additional search-based refinement step, the proposed estimator becomes particularly suitable for narrowband Internet of Things applications operating efficiently even under narrow carrier bandwidths. Finally, both the derived bounds and the proposed estimators are extended to scenarios where the bands assigned to each base station are nonuniform or fully disjoint, enhancing the practical deployment flexibility.

Title: Spacecube: A fast inverse hyperspectral georectification system
Authors: Thomas P. Watson, Eddie L. Jacobs
Abstract: Hyperspectral cameras provide numerous advantages in terms of the utility of the data captured. They capture hundreds of data points per sample (pixel) instead of only the few of RGB or multispectral camera systems. Aerial systems sense such data remotely, but the data must be georectified to produce consistent images before analysis. We find the traditional direct georectification method to be slow, and it is prone to artifacts. To address its downsides, we propose Spacecube, a program that implements a complete hyperspectral georectification pipeline, including our own fast inverse georectification technique, using OpenGL graphics programming technologies. Spacecube operates substantially faster than real-time and eliminates pixel coverage artifacts. It facilitates high quality interactive viewing, data exploration, and export of final products. We release Spacecube's source code publicly for the community to use.

Title: Predictive Controlled Music
Authors: Midhun T. Augustine
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to algorithmic composition, called predictive controlled music (PCM), which combines model predictive control (MPC) with music generation. PCM uses dynamic models to predict and optimize the music generation process, where musical notes are computed in a manner similar to an MPC problem by optimizing a performance measure. A feedforward neural network-based assessment function is used to evaluate the generated musical score, which serves as the objective function of the PCM optimization problem. Furthermore, a recurrent neural network model is employed to capture the relationships among the variables in the musical notes, and this model is then used to define the constraints in the PCM. Similar to MPC, the proposed PCM computes musical notes in a receding-horizon manner, leading to feedback controlled prediction. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the PCM generation method.

Title: From Imitation to Innovation: The Divergent Paths of Techno in Germany and the USA
Authors: Tim Ziemer, Simon Linke
Abstract: Many documentaries on early house and techno music exist. Here, protagonists from the scenes describe key elements and events that affected the evolution of the music. In the research community, there is consensus that such descriptions have to be examined critically. Yet, there have not been attempts to validate such statements on the basis of audio analyses. In this study, over 9,000 early house and techno tracks from Germany and the United States of America are analyzed using recording studio features, machine learning and inferential statistics. Three observations can be made: 1.) German and US house/techno music are distinct, 2.) US styles are much more alike, and 3.) scarcely evolved over time compared to German house/techno regarding the recording studio features. These findings are in agreement with documented statements and thus provide an audio-based perspective on why techno became a mass phenomenon in Germany but remained a fringe phenomenon in the USA. Observations like these can help the music industry estimate whether new trends will experience a breakthrough or disappear.

Title: Defense Against Synthetic Speech: Real-Time Detection of RVC Voice Conversion Attacks
Authors: Prajwal Chinchmalatpure, Suyash Chinchmalatpure, Siddharth Chavan
Abstract: Generative audio technologies now enable highly realistic voice cloning and real-time voice conversion, increasing the risk of impersonation, fraud, and misinformation in communication channels such as phone and video calls. This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC), evaluated on the DEEP-VOICE dataset, which includes authentic and voice-converted speech samples from multiple well-known speakers. To simulate realistic conditions, deepfake generation is applied to isolated vocal components, followed by the reintroduction of background ambiance to suppress trivial artifacts and emphasize conversion-specific cues. We frame detection as a streaming classification task by dividing audio into one-second segments, extracting time-frequency and cepstral features, and training supervised machine learning models to classify each segment as real or voice-converted. The proposed system enables low-latency inference, supporting both segment-level decisions and call-level aggregation. Experimental results show that short-window acoustic features can reliably capture discriminative patterns associated with RVC speech, even in noisy backgrounds. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of practical, real-time deepfake speech detection and underscore the importance of evaluating under realistic audio mixing conditions for robust deployment.

Title: LEMAS: Large A 150K-Hour Large-scale Extensible Multilingual Audio Suite with Generative Speech Models
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhao, Lijian Lin, Ye Zhu, Kai Xie, Yunfei Liu, Yu Li
Abstract: We present the LEMAS-Dataset, which, to our knowledge, is currently the largest open-source multilingual speech corpus with word-level timestamps. Covering over 150,000 hours across 10 major languages, LEMAS-Dataset is constructed via a efficient data processing pipeline that ensures high-quality data and annotations. To validate the effectiveness of LEMAS-Dataset across diverse generative paradigms, we train two benchmark models with distinct architectures and task specializations on this dataset. LEMAS-TTS, built upon a non-autoregressive flow-matching framework, leverages the dataset's massive scale and linguistic diversity to achieve robust zero-shot multilingual synthesis. Our proposed accent-adversarial training and CTC loss mitigate cross-lingual accent issues, enhancing synthesis stability. Complementarily, LEMAS-Edit employs an autoregressive decoder-only architecture that formulates speech editing as a masked token infilling task. By exploiting precise word-level alignments to construct training masks and adopting adaptive decoding strategies, it achieves seamless, smooth-boundary speech editing with natural transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on LEMAS-Dataset deliver high-quality synthesis and editing performance, confirming the dataset's quality. We envision that this richly timestamp-annotated, fine-grained multilingual corpus will drive future advances in prompt-based speech generation systems.

Title: SmoothSync: Dual-Stream Diffusion Transformers for Jitter-Robust Beat-Synchronized Gesture Generation from Quantized Audio
Authors: Yujiao Jiang, Qingmin Liao, Zongqing Lu
Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is a critical area of research aimed at synthesizing speech-synchronized human-like gestures. Existing methods often suffer from issues such as rhythmic inconsistency, motion jitter, foot sliding and limited multi-sampling diversity. In this paper, we present SmoothSync, a novel framework that leverages quantized audio tokens in a novel dual-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesis holistic gestures and enhance sampling variation. Specifically, we (1) fuse audio-motion features via complementary transformer streams to achieve superior synchronization, (2) introduce a jitter-suppression loss to improve temporal smoothness, (3) implement probabilistic audio quantization to generate distinct gesture sequences from identical inputs. To reliably evaluate beat synchronization under jitter, we introduce Smooth-BC, a robust variant of the beat consistency metric less sensitive to motion noise. Comprehensive experiments on the BEAT2 and SHOW datasets demonstrate SmoothSync's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by -30.6% FGD, 10.3% Smooth-BC, and 8.4% Diversity on BEAT2, while reducing jitter and foot sliding by -62.9% and -17.1% respectively. The code will be released to facilitate future research.

Authors: Yongyi Zang, Jiarui Hai, Wanying Ge, Qiuqiang Kong, Zheqi Dai, Helin Wang, Yuki Mitsufuji, Mark D. Plumbley
Abstract: Music Source Restoration (MSR) aims to recover original, unprocessed instrument stems from professionally mixed and degraded audio, requiring the reversal of both production effects and real-world degradations. We present the inaugural MSR Challenge, which features objective evaluation on studio-produced mixtures using Multi-Mel-SNR, Zimtohrli, and FAD-CLAP, alongside subjective evaluation on real-world degraded recordings. Five teams participated in the challenge. The winning system achieved 4.46 dB Multi-Mel-SNR and 3.47 MOS-Overall, corresponding to relative improvements of 91% and 18% over the second-place system, respectively. Per-stem analysis reveals substantial variation in restoration difficulty across instruments, with bass averaging 4.59 dB across all teams, while percussion averages only 0.29 dB. The dataset, evaluation protocols, and baselines are available at this https URL.

Title: Ultra-sensitive graphene-based electro-optic sensors for optically-multiplexed neural recording
Authors: Zabir Ahmed (1), Xiang Li (1), Kanika Sarna (1), Harshvardhan Gupta (1), Vishal Jain (1,2), Maysamreza Chamanzar (1,2,3) ((1) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA. (2) Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute, Pittsburgh, USA. (3) Department of Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA.)
Abstract: Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $\mu$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.

Title: Enhanced-FQL($λ$), an Efficient and Interpretable RL with novel Fuzzy Eligibility Traces and Segmented Experience Replay
Authors: Mohsen Jalaeian-Farimani
Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($\lambda$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($\lambda$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($\lambda$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.

Title: Achievable Rate and Coding Principle for MIMO Multicarrier Systems With Cross-Domain MAMP Receiver Over Doubly Selective Channels
Authors: Yuhao Chi, Zhiyuan Peng, Lei Liu, Ying Li, Yao Ge, Chau Yuen
Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.

Title: Large Language Models for Detecting Cyberattacks on Smart Grid Protective Relays
Authors: Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Saeed Jafari, Zhengmao Ouyang, Paul Budnarain, Amr Youssef, Deepa Kundur
Abstract: This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based framework for detecting cyberattacks on transformer current differential relays (TCDRs), which, if undetected, may trigger false tripping of critical transformers. The proposed approach adapts and fine-tunes compact LLMs such as DistilBERT to distinguish cyberattacks from actual faults using textualized multidimensional TCDR current measurements recorded before and after tripping. Our results demonstrate that DistilBERT detects 97.6% of cyberattacks without compromising TCDR dependability and achieves inference latency below 6 ms on a commercial workstation. Additional evaluations confirm the framework's robustness under combined time-synchronization and false-data-injection attacks, resilience to measurement noise, and stability across prompt formulation variants. Furthermore, GPT-2 and DistilBERT+LoRA achieve comparable performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity. We provide the full dataset used in this study for reproducibility.

Title: Hybrid Federated Learning for Noise-Robust Training
Authors: Yongjun Kim, Hyeongjun Park, Hwanjin Kim, Junil Choi
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.

Title: CircuitLM: A Multi-Agent LLM-Aided Design Framework for Generating Circuit Schematics from Natural Language Prompts
Authors: Khandakar Shakib Al Hasan, Syed Rifat Raiyan, Hasin Mahtab Alvee, Wahid Sadik
Abstract: Generating accurate circuit schematics from high-level natural language descriptions remains a persistent challenge in electronics design, as large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate in granular details, violate electrical constraints, and produce non-machine-readable outputs. We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts. Our code and data will be made public upon acceptance.

Title: Feasibility Study Regarding Self-sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Zhenyu Li, Ozan Alp Topal, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson, Cicek Cavdar
Abstract: Without requiring operational costs such as cabling and powering while maintaining reconfigurable phase-shift capability, self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ssRISs) can be deployed in locations inaccessible to conventional relays or base stations, offering a novel approach to enhance wireless coverage. This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.

Title: Learning Sparsifying Transforms for mmWave Communication via $\ell^4$-Norm Maximization
Authors: Sueda Taner, Christoph Studer
Abstract: The high directionality of wave propagation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies results in only a small number of significant transmission paths between user equipments and the basestation (BS). This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors.

Title: ZIVR: An Incremental Variance Reduction Technique For Zeroth-Order Composite Problems
Authors: Silan Zhang, Yujie Tang
Abstract: This paper investigates zeroth-order (ZO) finite-sum composite optimization. Recently, variance reduction techniques have been applied to ZO methods to mitigate the non-vanishing variance of 2-point estimators in constrained/composite optimization, yielding improved convergence rates. However, existing ZO variance reduction methods typically involve batch sampling of size at least $\Theta(n)$ or $\Theta(d)$, which can be computationally prohibitive for large-scale problems. In this work, we propose a general variance reduction framework, Zeroth-Order Incremental Variance Reduction (ZIVR), which supports flexible implementations$\unicode{x2014}$including a pure 2-point zeroth-order algorithm that eliminates the need for large batch sampling. Furthermore, we establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for ZIVR across strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex settings that match their first-order counterparts. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Title: Driver-Intention Prediction with Deep Learning: Real-Time Brain-to-Vehicle Communication
Authors: Niloufar Alavi, Swati Shah, Rezvan Alamian, Stefan Goetz
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.

Title: Federated Learning: A new frontier in the exploration of multi-institutional medical imaging data
Authors: Dominika Ciupek, Maciej Malawski, Tomasz Pieciak
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed the perspective of medical imaging, leading to a genuine technological revolution in modern computer-assisted healthcare systems. However, ubiquitously featured deep learning (DL) systems require access to a considerable amount of data, facilitating proper knowledge extraction and generalization. Access to such extensive resources may be hindered due to the time and effort required to convey ethical agreements, set up and carry the acquisition procedures through, and manage the datasets adequately with a particular emphasis on proper anonymization. One of the pivotal challenges in the DL field is data integration from various sources acquired using different hardware vendors, diverse acquisition protocols, experimental setups, and even inter-operator variabilities. In this paper, we review the federated learning (FL) concept that fosters the integration of large-scale heterogeneous datasets from multiple institutions in training DL models. In contrast to a centralized approach, the decentralized FL procedure promotes training DL models while preserving data privacy at each institution involved. We formulate the FL principle and comprehensively review general and specialized medical imaging aggregation and learning algorithms, enabling the generation of a globally generalized model. We meticulously go through the challenges in constructing FL-based systems, such as data and model heterogeneities across the institutions, resilience to potential attacks on data privacy, and the variability in computational and communication resources among the entangled sites that might induce efficiency issues of the entire system. Finally, we explore the up-to-date open frameworks for rapid FL-based algorithm prototyping, comprehensively present real-world implementations of FL systems and shed light on future directions in this intensively growing field.

Title: DermaCon-IN: A Multi-concept Annotated Dermatological Image Dataset of Indian Skin Disorders for Clinical AI Research

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising 5,450 clinical images from 3,002 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with 245 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, aetiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures, including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI.

Title: Leveraging Clinical Text and Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation
Authors: Emerson P. Grabke, Babak Taati, Masoom A. Haider
Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, nonmedical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM pipeline centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.070. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% and outperforms classifiers trained on images generated by prior state-of-the-art. Classifier training solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to real image training. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric pipeline enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Title: Sizing Antenna Arrays for Near-field Communication and Sensing
Authors: Marcin Wachowiak, André Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and sensing systems and their scaling behavior as a function of the antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard array geometries to ease the design of the large antenna arrays under given system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Moreover, when considering a region where the beamfocusing resolution does not exceed a specified threshold, the extent of the region is also shown to scale linearly with the array size. Finally, the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array's broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications.

Title: Noise-Tolerant Hybrid Approach for Data-Driven Predictive Control
Authors: Mahmood Mazare, Hossein Ramezani
Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in hybrid data-driven predictive control: the effect of measurement noise on Hankel matrices. While noise is handled in direct and indirect methods, hybrid approaches often overlook its impact during trajectory estimation. We propose a Noise-Tolerant Data-Driven Predictive Control (NTDPC) framework that integrates singular value decomposition to separate system dynamics from noise within reduced-order Hankel matrices. This enables accurate prediction with shorter data horizons and lower computational effort. A sensitivity index is introduced to support horizon selection under different noise levels. Simulation results indicate improved robustness and efficiency compared to existing hybrid methods.

Title: Integrated Polarimetric Sensing and Communication with Polarization-Reconfigurable Arrays
Authors: Byunghyun Lee, Rang Liu, David J. Love, James V. Krogmeier, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Polarization diversity offers a cost- and space-efficient solution to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems. Polarimetric sensing exploits the signal's polarity to extract details about the target such as shape, pose, and material composition. From a communication perspective, polarization diversity can enhance the reliability and throughput of communication channels. This paper proposes an integrated polarimetric sensing and communication (IPSAC) system that jointly conducts polarimetric sensing and communications. We study the use of single-port polarization-reconfigurable antennas to adapt to channel depolarization effects, without the need for separate RF chains for each polarization. We address two core sensing tasks in IPSAC systems, target parameter estimation and target detection. For parameter estimation, we consider the problem of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) of the target depolarization parameter estimate, which is a critical task for various polarimetric radar applications such as rainfall forecasting, vegetation identification, and target classification. To address this nonconvex problem, we apply semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) optimization techniques. Next, we consider a design that maximizes the target SINR leveraging prior knowledge of the target and clutter depolarization statistics to enhance the target detection performance. To tackle this problem, we modify the solution developed for MSE minimization subject to the same quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Extensive simulations show that the proposed polarization reconfiguration method substantially improves the depolarization parameter MSE. Furthermore, the proposed method considerably boosts the target SINR due to polarization diversity, particularly in cluttered environments.

Title: Sensing for Free: Learn to Localize More Sources than Antennas without Pilots
Authors: Wentao Yu, Khaled B. Letaief, Lizhong Zheng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for future wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications. With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited. We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over 30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission. Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.

Title: RadarPLM: Adapting Pre-trained Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection by Selective Fine-tuning
Authors: Qiying Hu, Yaowen Li, Shengyi Zhang, Chuan Huang, Yu Liu, You He
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities in capturing universal knowledge, making them promising for radar signal processing applications. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning PLMs on radar signals is both computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, particularly in low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) environments. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework for PLM-based marine radar target detection. First, we design a lightweight adaptation module, enabling computationally efficient fine-tuning while preserving the pre-trained model's general knowledge. Second, a novel preference-aware loss is developed to selectively optimize different feature patches based on their online-evaluated learning values, guiding the model to concentrate on those generalizable feature patterns during optimization. Finally, a binary classification head is retrained based on autoencoder network to further enhance detection performance. Experiments on real-world radar data show that the proposed RadarPLM framework yields at least a 6.35% improvement in detection performance over the existing networks under low SCR conditions. Especially, in the small-sample training cases, the proposed RadarPLM also achieves a significant advantage over existing networks owing to the incorporation of the PLM.

Title: Filter-and-Attend: Wireless Channel Foundation Model with Noise-Plus-Interference Suppression Structure
Authors: Yuwei Wang, Li Sun, Tingting Yang, Yuxuan Shi, Maged Elkashlan, Xiao Tang
Abstract: Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is pre-trained to learn a universal channel representation for a wide range of communications and sensing tasks. While existing works on WCFM have demonstrated its great potentials in various downstream tasks, the models are all trained using perfect (i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data. In practical systems, however, only degraded CSI obtained from pilot-based channel estimation is accessible, leading to distorted channel representations and performance degradation in downstream tasks for some real-world environments with severe noise and interference. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new paradigm for WCFM, termed as Filter-and-Attend. In this paradigm, Filter refers to explicitly suppressing noise-plus-interference (NPI) in the received signals, while Attend means performing correlation-aware CSI completion and feature extraction using attention mechanism. Specifically, an enhanced WCFM architecture is developed. In this architecture, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained and exploited to construct two projection matrices that extract NPI components in the received signals, which are further processed and removed by a subtraction module. The filtered signal is subsequently passed through a CSI completion network to get a clean CSI for feature extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves improved performance on various downstream tasks including time-domain channel prediction, frequency-domain channel prediction, and localization.

Title: AI Signal Processing Paradigm for Movable Antenna: From Spatial Position Optimization to Electromagnetic Reconfigurability
Authors: Yining Li, Ziwei Wan, Chongjia Sun, Kaijun Feng, Keke Ying, Wenyan Ma, Lipeng Zhu, Xiaodan Shao, Weidong Mei, Wenqian Shen, Zhenyu Xiao, Zhen Gao, Rui Zhang
Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence, high reconfigurability, and space-air-ground integration \cite{liu2025toward, liu2024near}, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) have become increasingly prominent. As a remedy, spatially movable antenna (SMA) and electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) have respectively emerged as key technologies to break through this bottleneck. SMA activates spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the electromagnetic domain. However, the ``spatial-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this issue, we integrate the spatial optimization of SMA and the electromagnetic reconfiguration of ERA, propose a unified modeling framework termed movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA) and investigate the channel modeling and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for MARA. Besides, we systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems. This paper fills the gap in existing literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal processing paradigm under spatial-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and provides theoretical guidance for the design and optimization of 6G wireless systems with advanced MARA.

Title: An Improved Dual-Attention Transformer-LSTM for Small-Sample Prediction of Modal Frequency and Actual Anchor Radius in Micro Hemispherical Resonator Design
Authors: Yuyi Yao, Gongliu Yang, Runzhuo Xu, Yongqiang Tu, Haozhou Mo
Abstract: The high-temperature glassblowing-fabricated micro hemispherical resonator (MHR) exhibits high symmetry and high Q-value for precision inertial navigation. However, MHR design entails a comprehensive evaluation of multiple possible configurations and demands extremely time-consuming simulation of key parameters combination. To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius. By checking fabricating feasibility of anchor radius and allowing rapid modal characteristics evaluation without interference, ablation and comparative experiments validated the method's superiority, as an effective support of MHR design. Design optimization experiments demonstrate a prediction accuracy of 96.35%, with computational time reduced to 1/48,000 of traditional finite element methods, significantly improving design efficiency. This study offers a new paradigm for intelligent Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) device design under complex process conditions.

Title: Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs
Authors: Velimir Todorovski, Kwang Hak Kim, Alessandro Astolfi, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.

Title: Structural Methods for handling mode changes in multimode DAE systems
Authors: Albert Benveniste, Benoit Caillaud, Yahao Chen, Khalil Ghorbal, Mathias Malandain
Abstract: Hybrid systems are an important concept in Cyber-Physical Systems modeling, for which multiphysics modeling from first principles and the reuse of models from libraries are key. To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user.

Title: OptiVote: Non-Coherent FSO Over-the-Air Majority Vote for Communication-Efficient Distributed Federated Learning in Space Data Centers
Authors: Anbang Zhang, Chenyuan Feng, Wai Ho Mow, Jia Ye, Shuaishuai Guo, Geyong Min, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

Title: Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems
Authors: Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Binarization Methods For Medical Image Hashing On Odir Dataset
Authors: Nedim Muzoglu
Abstract: In this study, we evaluated four binarization methods. Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), Iterative Quantization (ITQ), Kernel-based Supervised Hashing (KSH), and Supervised Discrete Hashing (SDH) on the ODIR dataset using deep feature embeddings. Experimental results show that SDH achieved the best performance, with an mAP@100 of 0.9184 using only 32-bit codes, outperforming LSH, ITQ, and KSH. Compared with prior studies, our method proved highly competitive: Fang et al. reported 0.7528 (Fundus-iSee, 48 bits) and 0.8856 (ASOCT-Cataract, 48 bits), while Wijesinghe et al. achieved 94.01 (KVASIR, 256 bits). Despite using significantly fewer bits, our SDH-based framework reached retrieval accuracy close to the state-of-the-art. These findings demonstrate that SDH is the most effective approach among those tested, offering a practical balance of accuracy, storage, and efficiency for medical image retrieval and device inventory management.

Title: TellWhisper: Tell Whisper Who Speaks When
Authors: Yifan Hu, Peiji Yang, Zhisheng Wang, Yicheng Zhong, Rui Liu
Abstract: Multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (MASR) aims to predict ''who spoke when and what'' from multi-speaker speech, a key technology for multi-party dialogue understanding. However, most existing approaches decouple temporal modeling and speaker modeling when addressing ''when'' and ''who'': some inject speaker cues before encoding (e.g., speaker masking), which can cause irreversible information loss; others fuse identity by mixing speaker posteriors after encoding, which may entangle acoustic content with speaker identity. This separation is brittle under rapid turn-taking and overlapping speech, often leading to degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose TellWhisper, a unified framework that jointly models speaker identity and temporal within the speech encoder. Specifically, we design TS-RoPE, a time-speaker rotary positional encoding: time coordinates are derived from frame indices, while speaker coordinates are derived from speaker activity and pause cues. By applying region-specific rotation angles, the model explicitly captures per-speaker continuity, speaker-turn transitions, and state dynamics, enabling the attention mechanism to simultaneously attend to ''when'' and ''who''. Moreover, to estimate frame-level speaker activity, we develop Hyper-SD, which casts speaker classification in hyperbolic space to enhance inter-class separation and refine speaker-activity estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding Converges with Optimal Number of Measurements for 1-Bit Compressed Sensing
Authors: Namiko Matsumoto, Arya Mazumdar
Abstract: Compressed sensing has been a very successful high-dimensional signal acquisition and recovery technique that relies on linear operations. However, the actual measurements of signals have to be quantized before storing or processing. 1(One)-bit compressed sensing is a heavily quantized version of compressed sensing, where each linear measurement of a signal is reduced to just one bit: the sign of the measurement. Once enough of such measurements are collected, the recovery problem in 1-bit compressed sensing aims to find the original signal with as much accuracy as possible. The recovery problem is related to the traditional "halfspace-learning" problem in learning theory. For recovery of sparse vectors, a popular reconstruction method from 1-bit measurements is the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm. The algorithm is a simple projected sub-gradient descent method, and is known to converge well empirically, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. The convergence property of BIHT was not theoretically justified, except with an exorbitantly large number of measurements (i.e., a number of measurement greater than $\max\{k^{10}, 24^{48}, k^{3.5}/\epsilon\}$, where $k$ is the sparsity, $\epsilon$ denotes the approximation error, and even this expression hides other factors). In this paper we show that the BIHT algorithm converges with only $\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ measurements. Note that, this dependence on $k$ and $\epsilon$ is optimal for any recovery method in 1-bit compressed sensing. With this result, to the best of our knowledge, BIHT is the only practical and efficient (polynomial time) algorithm that requires the optimal number of measurements in all parameters (both $k$ and $\epsilon$). This is also an example of a gradient descent algorithm converging to the correct solution for a nonconvex problem, under suitable structural conditions.

Title: Experimental Study of Low-Latency Video Streaming in an ORAN Setup with Generative AI
Authors: Andreas Casparsen, Van-Phuc Bui, Shashi Raj Pandey, Jimmy Jessen Nielsen, Petar Popovski
Abstract: Current Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) methods react to network congestion after it occurs, causing application layer buffering and latency spikes in live video streaming. We introduce a proactive semantic control channel that enables coordination between Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) xApp, Mobile Edge computing (MEC), and User Equipment (UE) components for seamless live video streaming between mobile devices. When the transmitting UE experiences poor Uplink (UL) conditions, the MEC proactively instructs downscaling based on low-level RAN metrics, including channel SNR updated every millisecond, preventing buffering before it occurs. A Generative AI (GAI) module at the MEC reconstructs high-quality frames from downscaled video before forwarding to the receiving UE via the typically more robust Downlink (DL). Experimental validation on a live ORAN testbed with 50 video streams shows that our approach reduces latency tail behavior while achieving up to 4 dB improvement in PSNR and 15 points in VMAF compared to reactive ABR methods. The proactive control eliminates latency spikes exceeding 600 ms, demonstrating effective cross-layer coordination for latency-critical live video streaming.

Title: Quaternion-Hadamard Network: A Novel Defense Against Adversarial Attacks with a New Dataset
Authors: Vladimir Frants, Sos Agaian
Abstract: Adverse-weather image restoration (e.g., rain, snow, haze) models remain highly vulnerable to gradient-based white-box adversarial attacks, wherein minimal loss-aligned perturbations cause substantial degradation in the restored output. This paper presents QHNet, a computationally efficient purification-based defense that precedes the restoration network and targets perturbation suppression in the transform and quaternion domains. QHNet incorporates a Quaternion Hadamard Polynomial Denoising Block (QHPDB) and a Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB) within an encoder-decoder framework to remove high-frequency adversarial noise while preserving fine structural details. Robustness is evaluated using PSNR and SSIM across rain, snow, and haze removal tasks, and further validated under adaptive, defense-aware white-box attacks employing Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA), and Expectation Over Transformation (EOT). Experimental results demonstrate that QHNet delivers superior restoration fidelity and significantly improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art purification baselines, confirming its effectiveness for low-level vision pipelines.

Title: QUIET-SR: Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Single Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Siddhant Dutta, Nouhaila Innan, Khadijeh Najafi, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique
Abstract: Recent advancements in Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using deep learning have significantly improved image restoration quality. However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. Our efficient batching strategy directly enables massive parallelization on multiple QPU's paving the way for practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution through coordinated QPU-GPU quantum supercomputing.

Title: Improving Bayesian Optimization for Portfolio Management with an Adaptive Scheduling
Authors: Zinuo You, John Cartlidge, Karen Elliott, Menghan Ge, Daniel Gold
Abstract: Existing black-box portfolio management systems are prevalent in the financial industry due to commercial and safety constraints, though their performance can fluctuate dramatically with changing market regimes. Evaluating these non-transparent systems is computationally expensive, as fixed budgets limit the number of possible observations. Therefore, achieving stable and sample-efficient optimization for these systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework (TPE-AS) that improves search stability and efficiency for black-box portfolio models under these limited observation budgets. Standard Bayesian optimization, which solely maximizes expected return, can yield erratic search trajectories and misalign the surrogate model with the true objective, thereby wasting the limited evaluation budget. To mitigate these issues, we propose a weighted Lagrangian estimator that leverages an adaptive schedule and importance sampling. This estimator dynamically balances exploration and exploitation by incorporating both the maximization of model performance and the minimization of the variance of model observations. It guides the search from broad, performance-seeking exploration towards stable and desirable regions as the optimization progresses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies, which establish our proposed method as the primary approach and other configurations as baselines, demonstrate its effectiveness across four backtest settings with three distinct black-box portfolio management models.

Title: Repeater Swarm-Assisted Cellular Systems: Interaction Stability and Performance Analysis
Authors: Jianan Bai, Anubhab Chowdhury, Anders Hansson, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.

Title: MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization
Authors: MOSI.AI: Donghua Yu, Zhengyuan Lin, Chen Yang, Yiyang Zhang, Hanfu Chen, Jingqi Chen, Ke Chen, Liwei Fan, Yi Jiang, Jie Zhu, Muchen Li, Wenxuan Wang, Yang Wang, Zhe Xu, Yitian Gong, Yuqian Zhang, Wenbo Zhang, Zhaoye Fei, Songlin Wang, Zhiyu Wu, Qinyuan Cheng, Shimin Li, Xipeng Qiu
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.

Title: MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning
Authors: Chunyu Qiang, Jun Wang, Xiaopeng Wang, Kang Yin, Yuxin Guo
Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.

Title: MoE Adapter for Large Audio Language Models: Sparsity, Disentanglement, and Gradient-Conflict-Free
Authors: Yishu Lei, Shuwei He, Jing Hu, Dan Zhang, Xianlong Luo, Danxiang Zhu, Shikun Feng, Rui Liu, Jingzhou He, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang
Abstract: Extending the input modality of Large Language Models~(LLMs) to the audio domain is essential for achieving comprehensive multimodal perception. However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textit{\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research.

Title: Towards Real-world Lens Active Alignment with Unlabeled Data via Domain Adaptation
Authors: Wenyong Li, Qi Jiang, Weijian Hu, Kailun Yang, Zhanjun Zhang, Wenjun Tian, Kaiwei Wang, Jian Bai
Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.
