Title: Universal MIMO Jammer Mitigation
Authors: Gian Marti, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Multi-antenna processing enables jammer mitigation through spatial filtering, provided that the receiver knows the spatial signature of the jammer interference. Estimating this signature is easy for barrage jammers that transmit continuously and with static signature, but difficult for more sophisticated jammers. Smart jammers may deliberately suspend transmission when the receiver tries to estimate their spatial signature, or they may use time-varying beamforming to continuously change their spatial signature. To deal with such smart jammers, we propose MASH, the first method that indiscriminately mitigates all types of jammers. Assume that the transmitter and receiver share a common secret. Based on this secret, the transmitter embeds (with a time-domain transform) its signal in a secret subspace of a higher-dimensional space. The receiver applies a reciprocal transform to the receive signal, which (i) raises the legitimate transmit signal from its secret subspace and (ii) provably transforms any jammer into a barrage jammer, making estimation and mitigation via multi-antenna processing straightforward. Focusing on the massive multi-user MIMO uplink, we present three MASH-based data detectors and show their jammer-resilience via extensive simulations. We also introduce strategies for multi-user communication without a global secret as well as methods that use computationally efficient embedding and raising transforms.

Title: Quantum Implicit Neural Compression
Authors: Takuya Fujihashi, Toshiaki Koike-Akino
Abstract: Signal compression based on implicit neural representation (INR) is an emerging technique to represent multimedia signals with a small number of bits. While INR-based signal compression achieves high-quality reconstruction for relatively low-resolution signals, the accuracy of high-frequency details is significantly degraded with a small model. To improve the compression efficiency of INR, we introduce quantum INR (quINR), which leverages the exponentially rich expressivity of quantum neural networks for data compression. Evaluations using some benchmark datasets show that the proposed quINR-based compression could improve rate-distortion performance in image compression compared with traditional codecs and classic INR-based coding methods, up to 1.2dB gain.

Title: Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks
Authors: Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu
Abstract: As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.

Title: Exploiting Movable-Element STARS for Wireless Communications
Authors: Jingjing Zhao, Quan Zhou, Xidong Mu, Kaiquan Cai, Yanbo Zhu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A novel movable-element enabled simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (ME-STARS) communication system is proposed, where ME-STARS elements positions can be adjusted to enhance the degress-of-freedom for transmission and reflection. For each ME-STARS operating protocols, namely energy-splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS), a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the active beamforming at the base station (BS) as well as the elements positions and passive beamforming at the ME-STARS. An alternative optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is developed to decompose the original non-convex problem into three subproblems. Specifically, the gradient descent algorithm is employed for solving the ME-STARS element position optimization subproblem, and the weighted minimum mean square error and the successive convex approximation methods are invoked for solving the active and passive beamforming subproblems, respectively. It is further demonstrated that the proposed AO algorithm for ES can be extended to solve the problems for MS and TS. Numerical results unveil that: 1) the ME-STARS can significantly improve the WSR compared to the STARS with fixed position elements and the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface with movable elements, thanks to the extra spatial-domain diversity and the higher flexibility in beamforming; and 2) the performance gain of ME-STARS is significant in the scenarios with larger number of users or more scatterers.

Title: SegKAN: High-Resolution Medical Image Segmentation with Long-Distance Dependencies
Authors: Shengbo Tan, Rundong Xue, Shipeng Luo, Zeyu Zhang, Xinran Wang, Lei Zhang, Daji Ergu, Zhang Yi, Yang Zhao, Ying Cai
Abstract: Hepatic vessels in computed tomography scans often suffer from image fragmentation and noise interference, making it difficult to maintain vessel integrity and posing significant challenges for vessel segmentation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative model: SegKAN. First, we improve the conventional embedding module by adopting a novel convolutional network structure for image embedding, which smooths out image noise and prevents issues such as gradient explosion in subsequent stages. Next, we transform the spatial relationships between Patch blocks into temporal relationships to solve the problem of capturing positional relationships between Patch blocks in traditional Vision Transformer models. We conducted experiments on a Hepatic vessel dataset, and compared to the existing state-of-the-art model, the Dice score improved by 1.78%. These results demonstrate that the proposed new structure effectively enhances the segmentation performance of high-resolution extended objects. Code will be available at this https URL

Title: Uncertainty Quantified Deep Learning and Regression Analysis Framework for Image Segmentation of Skin Cancer Lesions
Authors: Elhoucine Elfatimi, Pratik Shah
Abstract: Deep learning models (DLMs) frequently achieve accurate segmentation and classification of tumors from medical images. However, DLMs lacking feedback on their image segmentation mechanisms, such as Dice coefficients and confidence in their performance, face challenges when processing previously unseen images in real-world clinical settings. Uncertainty estimates to identify DLM predictions at the cellular or single-pixel level that require clinician review can enhance trust. However, their deployment requires significant computational resources. This study reports two DLMs, one trained from scratch and another based on transfer learning, with Monte Carlo dropout or Bayes-by-backprop uncertainty estimations to segment lesions from the publicly available The International Skin Imaging Collaboration-19 dermoscopy image database with cancerous lesions. A novel approach to compute pixel-by-pixel uncertainty estimations of DLM segmentation performance in multiple clinical regions from a single dermoscopy image with corresponding Dice scores is reported for the first time. Image-level uncertainty maps demonstrated correspondence between imperfect DLM segmentation and high uncertainty levels in specific skin tissue regions, with or without lesions. Four new linear regression models that can predict the Dice performance of DLM segmentation using constants and uncertainty measures, either individually or in combination from lesions, tissue structures, and non-tissue pixel regions critical for clinical diagnosis and prognostication in skin images (Spearman's correlation, p < 0.05), are reported for the first time for low-compute uncertainty estimation workflows.

Title: Online Low-Carbon Workload, Energy, and Temperature Management of Distributed Data Centers
Authors: Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng
Abstract: Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.

Title: On Random Sampling of Diffused Graph Signals with Sparse Inputs on Vertex Domain
Authors: Yingcheng Lai, Li Chai, Jinming Xu
Abstract: The sampling of graph signals has recently drawn much attention due to the wide applications of graph signal processing. While a lot of efficient methods and interesting results have been reported to the sampling of band-limited or smooth graph signals, few research has been devoted to non-smooth graph signals, especially to sparse graph signals, which are also of importance in many practical applications. This paper addresses the random sampling of non-smooth graph signals generated by diffusion of sparse inputs. We aim to present a solid theoretical analysis on the random sampling of diffused sparse graph signals, which can be parallel to that of band-limited graph signals, and thus present a sufficient condition to the number of samples ensuring the unique recovery for uniform random sampling. Then, we focus on two classes of widely used binary graph models, and give explicit and tighter estimations on the sampling numbers ensuring unique recovery. We also propose an adaptive variable-density sampling strategy to provide a better performance than uniform random sampling. Finally, simulation experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Title: CrossSpeech++: Cross-lingual Speech Synthesis with Decoupled Language and Speaker Generation
Authors: Ji-Hoon Kim, Hong-Sun Yang, Yoon-Cheol Ju, Il-Hwan Kim, Byeong-Yeol Kim, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: The goal of this work is to generate natural speech in multiple languages while maintaining the same speaker identity, a task known as cross-lingual speech synthesis. A key challenge of cross-lingual speech synthesis is the language-speaker entanglement problem, which causes the quality of cross-lingual systems to lag behind that of intra-lingual systems. In this paper, we propose CrossSpeech++, which effectively disentangles language and speaker information and significantly improves the quality of cross-lingual speech synthesis. To this end, we break the complex speech generation pipeline into two simple components: language-dependent and speaker-dependent generators. The language-dependent generator produces linguistic variations that are not biased by specific speaker attributes. The speaker-dependent generator models acoustic variations that characterize speaker identity. By handling each type of information in separate modules, our method can effectively disentangle language and speaker representation. We conduct extensive experiments using various metrics, and demonstrate that CrossSpeech++ achieves significant improvements in cross-lingual speech synthesis, outperforming existing methods by a large margin.

Title: Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting for Annotation-Efficient Bacteria Raman Spectroscopy Clustering and Classification
Authors: Haiming Yao, Wei Luo, Tao Zhou, Ang Gao, Xue Wang
Abstract: Raman scattering is based on molecular vibration spectroscopy and provides a powerful technology for pathogenic bacteria diagnosis using the unique molecular fingerprint information of a substance. The integration of deep learning technology has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of intelligent Raman spectroscopy (RS) recognition. However, the current RS recognition methods based on deep neural networks still require the annotation of a large amount of spectral data, which is labor-intensive. This paper presents a novel annotation-efficient Self-Calibrated Dual Contrasting (SCDC) method for RS recognition that operates effectively with few or no annotation. Our core motivation is to represent the spectrum from two different perspectives in two distinct subspaces: embedding and category. The embedding perspective captures instance-level information, while the category perspective reflects category-level information. Accordingly, we have implemented a dual contrastive learning approach from two perspectives to obtain discriminative representations, which are applicable for Raman spectroscopy recognition under both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning conditions. Furthermore, a self-calibration mechanism is proposed to enhance robustness. Validation of the identification task on three large-scale bacterial Raman spectroscopy datasets demonstrates that our SCDC method achieves robust recognition performance with very few (5$\%$ or 10$\%$) or no annotations, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for biospectral identification in annotation-efficient clinical scenarios.

Title: Amplitude-to-Phase Conversion in Injection-Locked CMOS Ring Oscillators
Authors: Zhaowen Wang
Abstract: Injection-locked ring oscillators (ILROs) are extensively employed for multi-phase clock generation in wireline and optical links. However, existing injection-locking theorems primarily rely on linearized phase-domain or nonlinear time-domain models, which fail to account for amplitude-to-phase conversion effects inherent in ILROs. This paper introduces an enhanced analytical model based on an extension of Adler's equation, explicitly incorporating amplitude-to-phase conversion. Simulation results demonstrate strong alignment with the proposed analytical predictions, validating the model's accuracy in capturing the locking range and phasor relationships.

Title: Towards influence centrality: where to not add an edge in the network?
Authors: Aashi Shrinate, Twinkle Tripathy
Abstract: In this work, we consider a strongly connected group of individuals involved in decision-making. The opinions of the individuals evolve using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model. We consider that there are two competing `influencers' (stubborn agents) vying for control over the final opinion of the group. We investigate the impact of modifying the network interactions on their respective control over the final opinions (influence centrality). We use signal flow graphs (SFG) to relate the network interactions with the influence that each `influencer' exerts on others. We present the sufficient conditions on the edge modifications which lead to the increase of the influence of an `influencer' at the expense of the other. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals the existence of redundant edge modifications that result in no change in the influence centrality of the network. We present several numerical examples to illustrate these results.

Title: Distance Based Single-Channel Target Speech Extraction
Authors: Runwu Shi, Benjamin Yen, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: This paper aims to achieve single-channel target speech extraction (TSE) in enclosures by solely utilizing distance information. This is the first work that utilizes only distance cues without using speaker physiological information for single-channel TSE. Inspired by recent single-channel Distance-based separation and extraction methods, we introduce a novel model that efficiently fuses distance information with time-frequency (TF) bins for TSE. Experimental results in both single-room and multi-room scenarios demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. This method can also be employed to estimate the distances of different speakers in mixed speech. Online demos are available at this https URL.

Title: Bird Vocalization Embedding Extraction Using Self-Supervised Disentangled Representation Learning
Authors: Runwu Shi, Katsutoshi Itoyama, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: This paper addresses the extraction of the bird vocalization embedding from the whole song level using disentangled representation learning (DRL). Bird vocalization embeddings are necessary for large-scale bioacoustic tasks, and self-supervised methods such as Variational Autoencoder (VAE) have shown their performance in extracting such low-dimensional embeddings from vocalization segments on the note or syllable level. To extend the processing level to the entire song instead of cutting into segments, this paper regards each vocalization as the generalized and discriminative part and uses two encoders to learn these two parts. The proposed method is evaluated on the Great Tits dataset according to the clustering performance, and the results outperform the compared pre-trained models and vanilla VAE. Finally, this paper analyzes the informative part of the embedding, further compresses its dimension, and explains the disentangled performance of bird vocalizations.

Title: Frames and vertex-frequency representations in graph fractional Fourier domain
Authors: Linbo Shang, Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: Vertex-frequency analysis, particularly the windowed graph Fourier transform (WGFT), is a significant challenge in graph signal processing. Tight frame theories is known for its low computational complexity in signal reconstruction, while fractional order methods shine at unveil more detailed structural characteristics of graph signals. In the graph fractional Fourier domain, we introduce multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier frames (MWGFRFF) to facilitate the construction of tight frames. This leads to developing the multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier transform (MWGFRFT), enabling novel vertex-frequency analysis methods. A reconstruction formula is derived, along with results concerning dual and tight frames. To enhance computational efficiency, a fast MWGFRFT (FMWGFRFT) algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, we define shift multi-windowed graph fractional Fourier frames (SMWGFRFF) and their associated transform (SMWGFRFT), exploring their dual and tight frames. Experimental results indicate that FMWGFRFT and SMWGFRFT excel in extracting vertex-frequency features in the graph fractional Fourier domain, with their combined use optimizing analytical performance. Applications in signal anomaly detection demonstrate the advantages of FMWGFRFT.

Title: Enhancing Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification with SMOTE: A Comparative Study
Authors: Md. Zehan Alam, Tonmoy Roy, H.M. Nahid Kawsar, Iffat Rimi
Abstract: This paper explores and enhances the application of Transfer Learning (TL) for multilabel image classification in medical imaging, focusing on brain tumor class and diabetic retinopathy stage detection. The effectiveness of TL-using pre-trained models on the ImageNet dataset-varies due to domain-specific challenges. We evaluate five pre-trained models-MobileNet, Xception, InceptionV3, ResNet50, and DenseNet201-on two datasets: Brain Tumor MRI and APTOS 2019. Our results show that TL models excel in brain tumor classification, achieving near-optimal metrics. However, performance in diabetic retinopathy detection is hindered by class imbalance. To mitigate this, we integrate the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) with TL and traditional machine learning(ML) methods, which improves accuracy by 1.97%, recall (sensitivity) by 5.43%, and specificity by 0.72%. These findings underscore the need for combining TL with resampling techniques and ML methods to address data imbalance and enhance classification performance, offering a pathway to more accurate and reliable medical image analysis and improved patient outcomes with minimal extra computation powers.

Title: High-Performance Model Predictive Control for Quadcopters with Formal Stability Guarantees
Authors: Maedeh Izadi, A.T.J.R. Cobbenhagen, Ruben Sommer, A.R.P. Andriën, Erjen Lefeber, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel cascade control structure with formal guarantees of uniform almost global asymptotic stability for the state tracking error dynamics of a quadcopter. The proposed approach features a model predictive control strategy for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for the non-zero total thrust constraint. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude, angular velocity and acceleration references, subsequently tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. The proposed cascade control strategy is validated through numerical case studies, underlying high-fidelity models, demonstrating its ability to track fast trajectories with small error.

Title: Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking
Authors: Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon
Abstract: Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.

Title: Two-Timescale Design for AP Mode Selection of Cooperative ISAC Networks
Authors: Zhichu Ren, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Dongming Wang, Lexi Xu, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: As an emerging technology, cooperative bi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is promising to achieve high-precision sensing, high-rate communication as well as self-interference (SI) avoidance. This paper investigates the two-timescale design for access point (AP) mode selection to realize the full potential of the cooperative bi-static ISAC network with low system overhead, where the beamforming at the APs is adapted to the rapidly-changing instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while the AP mode is adapted to the slowly-changing statistical CSI. We first apply the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator to estimate the channel between the APs and the channels from the APs to the user equipments (UEs). Then we adopt the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming and the maximum ratio combining (MRC) detector, and derive the closed-form expressions of the communication rate and the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR). We formulate a non-convex integer optimization problem to maximize the minimum sensing SINR under the communication quality of service (QoS) constraints. McCormick envelope relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are applied to solve the challenging non-convex integer optimization problem. Simulation results validate the closed-form expressions and prove the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed AP mode selection scheme.

Title: Distributed Convex Optimization with State-Dependent (Social) Interactions over Random Networks
Authors: Seyyed Shaho Alaviani, Atul Kelkar
Abstract: This paper aims at distributed multi-agent convex optimization where the communications network among the agents are presented by a random sequence of possibly state-dependent weighted graphs. This is the first work to consider both random arbitrary communication networks and state-dependent interactions among agents. The state-dependent weighted random operator of the graph is shown to be quasi-nonexpansive; this property neglects a priori distribution assumption of random communication topologies to be imposed on the operator. Therefore, it contains more general class of random networks with or without asynchronous protocols. A more general mathematical optimization problem than that addressed in the literature is presented, namely minimization of a convex function over the fixed-value point set of a quasi-nonexpansive random operator. A discrete-time algorithm is provided that is able to converge both almost surely and in mean square to the global solution of the optimization problem. Hence, as a special case, it reduces to a totally asynchronous algorithm for the distributed optimization problem. The algorithm is able to converge even if the weighted matrix of the graph is periodic and irreducible under synchronous protocol. Finally, a case study on a network of robots in an automated warehouse is given where there is distribution dependency among random communication graphs.

Title: EmoReg: Directional Latent Vector Modeling for Emotional Intensity Regularization in Diffusion-based Voice Conversion
Authors: Ashishkumar Gudmalwar, Ishan D. Biyani, Nirmesh Shah, Pankaj Wasnik, Rajiv Ratn Shah
Abstract: The Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) aims to convert the discrete emotional state from the source emotion to the target for a given speech utterance while preserving linguistic content. In this paper, we propose regularizing emotion intensity in the diffusion-based EVC framework to generate precise speech of the target emotion. Traditional approaches control the intensity of an emotional state in the utterance via emotion class probabilities or intensity labels that often lead to inept style manipulations and degradations in quality. On the contrary, we aim to regulate emotion intensity using self-supervised learning-based feature representations and unsupervised directional latent vector modeling (DVM) in the emotional embedding space within a diffusion-based framework. These emotion embeddings can be modified based on the given target emotion intensity and the corresponding direction vector. Furthermore, the updated embeddings can be fused in the reverse diffusion process to generate the speech with the desired emotion and intensity. In summary, this paper aims to achieve high-quality emotional intensity regularization in the diffusion-based EVC framework, which is the first of its kind work. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been shown across state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in terms of subjective and objective evaluations for the English and Hindi languages \footnote{Demo samples are available at the following URL: \url{this https URL}}.

Title: Cooperative ISAC-empowered Low-Altitude Economy
Authors: Jun Tang, Yiming Yu, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.

Title: A Novel Supervisory Control Algorithm to Avoid Deadlock in a Manufacturing System Based on Petri Net in Presence of Resource Failure
Authors: Ahmad Bagheri, Mohammadhossein Aghaazizi, Ali Doustmohammadi
Abstract: It is well established that resource failure, including robots and machines, in a manufacturing system can result in deadlocks. This issue not only hampers the system's performance but can also inflict significant damage on the manufacturing process. In this paper, we present a new algorithm developed through modeling of a manufacturing system using Petri net that ensures the liveness of the net in the event of such a failure. To detect possible failures, we first design a recovery subnet that is integrated into the resource. Next, we analyze the effects of failures on each state of the network to identify forbidden states. Finally, we propose an algorithm that optimally adds control places and establishes new constant vectors within the network, enabling effective management of remaining resources across different parts of the net. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a system featuring three manufacturing lines, demonstrating its error-free operation while ensuring key properties such as boundedness, liveness, and performance continuity within the net.

Title: Unlocking adaptive digital pathology through dynamic feature learning
Authors: Jiawen Li, Tian Guan, Qingxin Xia, Yizhi Wang, Xitong Ling, Jing Li, Qiang Huang, Zihan Wang, Zhiyuan Shen, Yifei Ma, Zimo Zhao, Zhe Lei, Tiandong Chen, Junbo Tan, Xueqian Wang, Xiu-Wu Bian, Zhe Wang, Lingchuan Guo, Chao He, Yonghong He
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized the paradigm of digital pathology, as they leverage general-purpose features to emulate real-world pathological practices, enabling the quantitative analysis of critical histological patterns and the dissection of cancer-specific signals. However, these static general features constrain the flexibility and pathological relevance in the ever-evolving needs of clinical applications, hindering the broad use of the current models. Here we introduce PathFiT, a dynamic feature learning method that can be effortlessly plugged into various pathology foundation models to unlock their adaptability. Meanwhile, PathFiT performs seamless implementation across diverse pathology applications regardless of downstream specificity. To validate PathFiT, we construct a digital pathology benchmark with over 20 terabytes of Internet and real-world data comprising 28 H\&E-stained tasks and 7 specialized imaging tasks including Masson's Trichrome staining and immunofluorescence images. By applying PathFiT to the representative pathology foundation models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 34 out of 35 tasks, with significant improvements on 23 tasks and outperforming by 10.20% on specialized imaging tasks. The superior performance and versatility of PathFiT open up new avenues in computational pathology.

Title: Low-Thrust Under-Actuated Satellite Formation Guidance and Control Strategies
Authors: Ahmed Mahfouz, Gabriella Gaias, Florio Dalla Vedova, Holger Voos
Abstract: This study presents autonomous guidance and control strategies for the purpose of reconfiguring close-range multi-satellite formations. The formation under consideration includes $N$ under-actuated deputy satellites and an uncontrolled virtual or physical chief spacecraft. The guidance problem is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem that incorporates typical dynamical and physical constraints, alongside a minimum acceleration threshold. This latter constraint arises from the physical limitations of the adopted low-thrust technology, which is commonly employed for precise, close-range relative orbital maneuvers. The guidance and control problem is addressed in two frameworks: centralized and distributed. The centralized approach provides a fuel-optimal solution, but it is practical only for formations with a small number of deputies. The distributed approach is more scalable but yields sub-optimal solutions. In the centralized framework, the chief is a physical satellite responsible for all calculations, while in the distributed framework, the chief is treated as a virtual point mass orbiting the Earth, and each deputy performs its own guidance and control calculations onboard. The study emphasizes the spaceborne implementation of the closed-loop control system, aiming for a reliable and automated solution to the optimal control problem. To this end, the risk of infeasibility is mitigated through first identifying the constraints that pose a potential threat of infeasibility, then properly softening them. Two Model Predictive Control architectures are implemented and compared, namely, a shrinking-horizon and a fixed-horizon schemes. Performances, in terms of fuel expenditure and achieved control accuracy, are analyzed on typical close-range reconfigurations requested by Earth observation missions and are compared against different implementations proposed in the literature.

Abstract: A novel frequency diverse array (FDA)-assisted secure transmission framework is proposed, which leverages additional frequency offsets to enhance physical layer security. Specifically, an FDA-assisted wiretap channel is considered, where the transmit beamforming and frequency offsets at each antenna are jointly optimized. A novel alternating optimization-based method is introduced to address the non-convex problem of secure transmission, focusing on minimizing transmit power and maximizing the secrecy rate. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the FDA-based framework compared to systems employing traditional phased array antennas in secure transmission.

Title: Segmentation of Muscularis Propria in Colon Histopathology Images Using Vision Transformers for Hirschsprung's Disease
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Anthony Fuller, Saleh Abou-Alwan, Dina El Demellawy, Adrian D. C. Chan
Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a congenital birth defect diagnosed by identifying the lack of ganglion cells within the colon's muscularis propria, specifically within the myenteric plexus regions. There may be advantages for quantitative assessments of histopathology images of the colon, such as counting the ganglion and assessing their spatial distribution; however, this would be time-intensive for pathologists, costly, and subject to inter- and intra-rater variability. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for deep learning approaches to automate histopathology image analysis, including segmentation of the muscularis propria using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful deep learning approach due to their self-attention. This study explores the application of ViTs for muscularis propria segmentation in calretinin-stained histopathology images and compares their performance to CNNs and shallow learning methods. The ViT model achieved a DICE score of 89.9% and Plexus Inclusion Rate (PIR) of 100%, surpassing the CNN (DICE score of 89.2%; PIR of 96.0%) and k-means clustering method (DICE score of 80.7%; PIR 77.4%). Results assert that ViTs are a promising tool for advancing HD-related image analysis.

Title: Conformable Convolution for Topologically Aware Learning of Complex Anatomical Structures
Authors: Yousef Yeganeh, Rui Xiao, Goktug Guvercin, Nassir Navab, Azade Farshad
Abstract: While conventional computer vision emphasizes pixel-level and feature-based objectives, medical image analysis of intricate biological structures necessitates explicit representation of their complex topological properties. Despite their successes, deep learning models often struggle to accurately capture the connectivity and continuity of fine, sometimes pixel-thin, yet critical structures due to their reliance on implicit learning from data. Such shortcomings can significantly impact the reliability of analysis results and hinder clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we introduce Conformable Convolution, a novel convolutional layer designed to explicitly enforce topological consistency. Conformable Convolution learns adaptive kernel offsets that preferentially focus on regions of high topological significance within an image. This prioritization is guided by our proposed Topological Posterior Generator (TPG) module, which leverages persistent homology. The TPG module identifies key topological features and guides the convolutional layers by applying persistent homology to feature maps transformed into cubical complexes. Our proposed modules are architecture-agnostic, enabling them to be integrated seamlessly into various architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in the segmentation task, where preserving the interconnectedness of structures is critical. Experimental results on three diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively preserves the topology in the segmentation downstream task, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Title: Nanosatellite Design Considerations for a Mission to Explore the Propellant Sloshing Problem
Authors: Michael fogel, Snigdha Sushil Mishra, Laurent Burlion
Abstract: Sloshing Platform for In-Orbit Controller Experimentation is an ambitious, student run mission to design and fly a cubesat to study fluid sloshing in spacecraft. The project will examine zero-g propellant sloshing from an experimental standpoint. Despite the small size and limited payload capacity, we intend to use the cubesat platform to mimic larger spacecraft and implement novel detection and computer vision methods in our analysis. Many modern spacecraft rely on propellant-filled tanks to perform attitude control and station-keeping maneuvers. When a large percentage of the spacecraft's mass is comprised of liquid propellant, sloshing becomes a critical aspect of spacecraft attitude control and stability. The mission will study the tank/fluid dynamics using new methods to gain an enhanced understanding of low-gravity fluid disturbance effects and improve simulations using equivalent mechanical models (EMMs). Active control of the fluid leading to the reduction of propellant slosh settling times will improve the maneuverability and performance of spacecraft. This paper will focus on satellite payload research and design requirements used to inform other aspects of the SPICEsat design. In this paper, mission objectives will be discussed, numerical simulations for the proposed control algorithms are demonstrated, and a satellite experiment design is presented. Finally, we examine computational fluid dynamics models to validate the satellite design and propellant sensing components of the proposed spacecraft.

Title: Highway Managed Lane Usage and Tolling for Mixed Traffic Flows with Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and High-Occupancy Vehicles (HOVs)
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Hani S. Mahmassani
Abstract: This paper investigates managed lane (ML) toll setting and its effect under mixed traffic of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), with a goal to avoid flow breakdown and minimize total social cost. A mesoscopic finite-difference traffic simulation model considers the flow-density relationship at different CAV market penetration rates, lane-changing behavior, and multiple entries/exits, interacting with a reactive toll setting mechanism. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation suggest an optimal policy of untolled HOV/CAV use with HDV tolls in particular scenarios of limited CAV market penetration. Small and targeted tolling avoids flow breakdown in ML while prioritizing HOVs and other vehicles with high values of time. Extensions of the formulation and sensitivity analysis quantify the benefits of converting high-occupancy HDVs to CAVs. The optimal tolling regime combines traffic science notions of flow stability and the economics of resource allocation.

Title: MarsSQE: Stereo Quality Enhancement for Martian Images Using Bi-level Cross-view Attention
Authors: Mai Xu, Yinglin Zhu, Qunliang Xing, Jing Yang, Xin Zou
Abstract: Stereo images captured by Mars rovers are transmitted after lossy compression due to the limited bandwidth between Mars and Earth. Unfortunately, this process results in undesirable compression artifacts. In this paper, we present a novel stereo quality enhancement approach for Martian images, named MarsSQE. First, we establish the first dataset of stereo Martian images. Through extensive analysis of this dataset, we observe that cross-view correlations in Martian images are notably high. Leveraging this insight, we design a bi-level cross-view attention-based quality enhancement network that fully exploits these inherent cross-view correlations. Specifically, our network integrates pixel-level attention for precise matching and patch-level attention for broader contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MarsSQE approach.

Title: Metadata-Enhanced Speech Emotion Recognition: Augmented Residual Integration and Co-Attention in Two-Stage Fine-Tuning
Authors: Zixiang Wan, Ziyue Qiu, Yiyang Liu, Wei-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) involves analyzing vocal expressions to determine the emotional state of speakers, where the comprehensive and thorough utilization of audio information is paramount. Therefore, we propose a novel approach on self-supervised learning (SSL) models that employs all available auxiliary information -- specifically metadata -- to enhance performance. Through a two-stage fine-tuning method in multi-task learning, we introduce the Augmented Residual Integration (ARI) module, which enhances transformer layers in encoder of SSL models. The module efficiently preserves acoustic features across all different levels, thereby significantly improving the performance of metadata-related auxiliary tasks that require various levels of features. Moreover, the Co-attention module is incorporated due to its complementary nature with ARI, enabling the model to effectively utilize multidimensional information and contextual relationships from metadata-related auxiliary tasks. Under pre-trained base models and speaker-independent setup, our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on multiple SSL encoders for the IEMOCAP dataset.

Title: Residual Connection Networks in Medical Image Processing: Exploration of ResUnet++ Model Driven by Human Computer Interaction
Authors: Peixin Dai, Jingsi Zhang, Zhitao Shu
Abstract: Accurate identification and localisation of brain tumours from medical images remain challenging due to tumour variability and structural complexity. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly ResNet and Unet, have made significant progress in medical image processing, offering robust capabilities for image segmentation. However, limited research has explored their integration with human-computer interaction (HCI) to enhance usability, interpretability, and clinical applicability. This paper introduces ResUnet++, an advanced hybrid model combining ResNet and Unet++, designed to improve tumour detection and localisation while fostering seamless interaction between clinicians and medical imaging systems. ResUnet++ integrates residual blocks in both the downsampling and upsampling phases, ensuring critical image features are preserved. By incorporating HCI principles, the model provides intuitive, real-time feedback, enabling clinicians to visualise and interact with tumour localisation results effectively. This fosters informed decision-making and supports workflow efficiency in clinical settings. We evaluated ResUnet++ on the LGG Segmentation Dataset, achieving a Jaccard Loss of 98.17%. The results demonstrate its strong segmentation performance and potential for real-world applications. By bridging advanced medical imaging techniques with HCI, ResUnet++ offers a foundation for developing interactive diagnostic tools, improving clinician trust, decision accuracy, and patient outcomes, and advancing the integration of AI in healthcare workflows.

Title: Improving Acoustic Scene Classification in Low-Resource Conditions
Authors: Zhi Chen, Yun-Fei Shao, Yong Ma, Mingsheng Wei, Le Zhang, Wei-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) identifies an environment based on an audio signal. This paper explores ASC in low-resource conditions and proposes a novel model, DS-FlexiNet, which combines depthwise separable convolutions from MobileNetV2 with ResNet-inspired residual connections for a balance of efficiency and accuracy. To address hardware limitations and device heterogeneity, DS-FlexiNet employs Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for model compression and data augmentation methods like Auto Device Impulse Response (ADIR) and Freq-MixStyle (FMS) to improve cross-device generalization. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from twelve teacher models further enhances performance on unseen devices. The architecture includes a custom Residual Normalization layer to handle domain differences across devices, and depthwise separable convolutions reduce computational overhead without sacrificing feature representation. Experimental results show that DS-FlexiNet excels in both adaptability and performance under resource-constrained conditions.

Authors: Naveed A. Abbasi, Kelvin Arana, Siddhant Singh, Atulya Bist, Vikram Vasudevan, Tathagat Pal, Jorge Gomez-Ponce, Young-Han Nam, Charlie Zhang, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: The upper midband, designated as Frequency Range 3 (FR3), is increasingly critical for the next-generation of wireless networks. Channel propagation measurements and their statistical analysis are essential first steps towards this direction. This paper presents a comprehensive ultra-wideband (UWB) double-directional channel measurement campaign in a large portion of FR3 (6-14 GHz) for urban microcellular environments. We analyze over 25,000 directional power delay profiles and providing key insights into line-of-sight (LoS) and obstructed line-of-sight (OLoS) conditions. This is followed by statistical modeling of path loss, shadowing, delay spread and angular spread. As the first UWB double-directional measurement campaign in this frequency range, this work offers critical insights for spectrum allocation, channel modeling, and the design of advanced communication systems, paving the way for further exploration of FR3.

Title: An Experimental Study of Passive UAV Tracking with Digital Arrays and Cellular Downlink Signals
Authors: Yifei Sun, Chao Yu, Yan Luo, Tony Xiao Han, Haisheng Tan, Rui Wang, Francis C. M. Lau
Abstract: Given the prospects of the low-altitude economy (LAE) and the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are increasing demands on monitoring flying objects at low altitude in wide urban areas. In this work, the widely deployed long-term evolution (LTE) base station (BS) is exploited to illuminate UAVs in bistatic trajectory tracking. Specifically, a passive sensing receiver with two digital antenna arrays is proposed and developed to capture both the line-of-sight (LoS) signal and the scattered signal off a target UAV. From their cross ambiguity function, the bistatic range, Doppler shift and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the target UAV can be detected in a sequence of time slots. In order to address missed detections and false alarms of passive sensing, a multi-target tracking framework is adopted to track the trajectory of the target UAV. It is demonstrated by experiments that the proposed UAV tracking system can achieve a meter-level accuracy.

Title: Phoneme-Level Contrastive Learning for User-Defined Keyword Spotting with Flexible Enrollment
Authors: Li Kewei, Zhou Hengshun, Shen Kai, Dai Yusheng, Du Jun
Abstract: User-defined keyword spotting (KWS) enhances the user experience by allowing individuals to customize keywords. However, in open-vocabulary scenarios, most existing methods commonly suffer from high false alarm rates with confusable words and are limited to either audio-only or text-only enrollment. Therefore, in this paper, we first explore the model's robustness against confusable words. Specifically, we propose Phoneme-Level Contrastive Learning (PLCL), which refines and aligns query and source feature representations at the phoneme level. This method enhances the model's disambiguation capability through fine-grained positive and negative comparisons for more accurate alignment, and it is generalizable to jointly optimize both audio-text and audio-audio matching, adapting to various enrollment modes. Furthermore, we maintain a context-agnostic phoneme memory bank to construct confusable negatives for data augmentation. Based on this, a third-category discriminator is specifically designed to distinguish hard negatives. Overall, we develop a robust and flexible KWS system, supporting different modality enrollment methods within a unified framework. Verified on the LibriPhrase dataset, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Movable Antennas Enabled ISAC Systems: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions
Authors: Zhendong Li, Jianle Ba, Zhou Su, Jinyuan Huang, Haixia Peng, Wen Chen, Linkang Du, Tom H. Luan
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything. Meanwhile, MA utilizes the spatial variations of wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the positions of MA elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve the channel and further enhance the performance of the ISAC systems. In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.

Title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Mobile Edge Computing via Large Language Model
Authors: Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang
Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.

Title: Enhancing Multimodal Emotion Recognition through Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment
Authors: Xuechen Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Haoqin Sun, Hui Wang, Jiaming Zhou, Yong Qin
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER), leveraging speech and text, has emerged as a pivotal domain within human-computer interaction, demanding sophisticated methods for effective multimodal integration. The challenge of aligning features across these modalities is significant, with most existing approaches adopting a singular alignment strategy. Such a narrow focus not only limits model performance but also fails to address the complexity and ambiguity inherent in emotional expressions. In response, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment (MGCMA) framework, distinguished by its comprehensive approach encompassing distribution-based, instance-based, and token-based alignment modules. This framework enables a multi-level perception of emotional information across modalities. Our experiments on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Fine-Tuning TransMorph with Gradient Correlation for Anatomical Alignment
Authors: Lukas Förner, Kartikay Tehlan, Thomas Wendler
Abstract: Unsupervised deep learning is a promising method in brain MRI registration to reduce the reliance on anatomical labels, while still achieving anatomically accurate transformations. For the Learn2Reg2024 LUMIR challenge, we propose fine-tuning of the pre-trained TransMorph model to improve the convergence stability as well as the deformation smoothness. The former is achieved through the FAdam optimizer, and consistency in structural changes is incorporated through the addition of gradient correlation in the similarity measure, improving anatomical alignment. The results show slight improvements in the Dice and HdDist95 scores, and a notable reduction in the NDV compared to the baseline TransMorph model. These are also confirmed by inspecting the boundaries of the tissue. Our proposed method highlights the effectiveness of including Gradient Correlation to achieve smoother and structurally consistent deformations for interpatient brain MRI registration.

Title: Data-Based Efficient Off-Policy Stabilizing Optimal Control Algorithms for Discrete-Time Linear Systems via Damping Coefficients
Authors: Dongdong Li, Jiuxiang Dong
Abstract: Policy iteration is one of the classical frameworks of reinforcement learning, which requires a known initial stabilizing control. However, finding the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients. This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy $\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.

Title: Generative Deep Synthesis of MIMO Sensing Waveforms with Desired Transmit Beampattern
Authors: Vesa Saarinen, Robin Rajamäki, Visa Koivunen
Abstract: This paper develops a generative deep learning model for the synthesis of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) active sensing waveforms with desired properties, including constant modulus and a user-defined beampattern. The proposed approach is capable synthesizing unique phase codes of on-the-fly, which has the potential to reduce interference between co-existing active sensing systems and facilitate Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) radar operation. The paper extends our earlier work on synthesis of approximately orthogonal MIMO phase codes by introducing flexible control over the transmit beampatterns. The developed machine learning method employs a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structure. The main benefits of the method are its ability to discover new waveforms on-demand (post training) and generate demanding beampatterns at lower computational complexity compared to structured optimization approaches.

Title: Generative AI Empowered Semantic Feature Multiple Access (SFMA) Over Wireless Networks
Authors: Jiaxiang Wang, Yinchao Yang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Mingzhe Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel generative artificial intelligence (GAI) empowered multi-user semantic communication system called semantic feature multiple access (SFMA) for video transmission, which comprises a base station (BS) and paired users. The BS generates and combines semantic information of several frames simultaneously requested by paired users into a single signal. Users recover their frames from this combined signal and input the recovered frames into a GAI-based video frame interpolation model to generate the intermediate frame. To optimize transmission rates and temporal gaps between simultaneously transmitted frames, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system sum rate while minimizing temporal gaps. Since the standard signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) equation does not accurately capture the performance of our semantic communication system, we introduce a weight parameter into the SINR equation to better represent the system's performance. Due to its dependence on transmit power, we propose a three-step solution. First, we develop a user pairing algorithm that pairs two users with the highest preference value, a weighted combination of semantic transmission rate and temporal gap. Second, we optimize inter-group power allocation by formulating an optimization problem that allocates proper transmit power across all user groups to maximize system sum rates while satisfying each user's minimum rate requirement. Third, we address intra-group power allocation to enhance each user's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our method improves transmission rates by up to 24.8%, 45.8%, and 66.1% compared to fixed-power non-orthogonal multiple access (F-NOMA), orthogonal joint source-channel coding (O-JSCC), and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), respectively.

Title: Practical Implementation and Experimental Validation of an Optimal Control based Eco-Driving System
Authors: Vinith Kumar Lakshmanan, Olivier Lemaire, Antonio Sciarretta
Abstract: The main goal of Eco-Driving (ED) is to maximize energy efficiency. This study evaluates the energy gains of an ED system for an electric vehicle, obtained from a predictive optimal controller, in a real-world traffic scenario. To this end, a Visual driver Advisory System (VAS) in the form of a personal tablet is used to advise the driver to follow a target eco-speed via a screen. Two Renault Zoe electric cars, one equipped with the different modules for ED and one without, are used to perform field tests on a route between Rueil-Malmaison and Bougival in France. Overall, the ED consumed, on average, 4.6~$\%$ less energy than the non-eco-driven car with a maximum of 2~$\%$ change in average speed.

Title: Sequential Maximum-Likelihood Estimation of Wideband Polynomial-Phase Signals on Sensor Array
Authors: Kaleb Debre, Tai Fei, Marius Pesavento
Abstract: This paper presents a novel sequential estimator for the direction-of-arrival and polynomial coefficients of wideband polynomial-phase signals impinging on a sensor array. Addressing the computational challenges of Maximum-likelihood estimation for this problem, we propose a method leveraging random sampling consensus (RANSAC) applied to the time-frequency spatial signatures of sources. Our approach supports multiple sources and higher-order polynomials by employing coherent array processing and sequential approximations of the Maximum-likelihood cost function. We also propose a low-complexity variant that estimates source directions via angular domain random sampling. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve Cramér-Rao bounds in challenging multi-source scenarios, including closely spaced time-frequency spatial signatures, highlighting their suitability for advanced radar signal processing applications.

Title: Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees
Authors: Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal
Abstract: This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.

Title: Privacy-Aware Multi-Device Cooperative Edge Inference with Distributed Resource Bidding
Authors: Wenhao Zhuang, Yuyi Mao
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) has empowered mobile devices (MDs) in supporting artificial intelligence (AI) applications through collaborative efforts with proximal MEC servers. Unfortunately, despite the great promise of device-edge cooperative AI inference, data privacy becomes an increasing concern. In this paper, we develop a privacy-aware multi-device cooperative edge inference system for classification tasks, which integrates a distributed bidding mechanism for the MEC server's computational resources. Intermediate feature compression is adopted as a principled approach to minimize data privacy leakage. To determine the bidding values and feature compression ratios in a distributed fashion, we formulate a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) model, for which, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in privacy-preserving cooperative edge inference. Specifically, given a sufficient level of data privacy protection, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.31-0.95% improvements in classification accuracy compared to the approach being agnostic to the wireless channel conditions. The performance is further enhanced by 1.54-1.67% by considering the difficulties of inference data.

Title: Comparative Analysis of 2D and 3D ResNet Architectures for IDH and MGMT Mutation Detection in Glioma Patients
Authors: Danial Elyassirad, Benyamin Gheiji, Mahsa Vatanparast, Amir Mahmoud Ahmadzadeh, Neda Kamandi, Amirmohammad Soleimanian, Sara Salehi, Shahriar Faghani
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common cause of mortality among primary brain tumors. Molecular markers, including Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) and O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) influence treatment responses and prognosis. Deep learning (DL) models may provide a non-invasive method for predicting the status of these molecular markers. To achieve non-invasive determination of gene mutations in glioma patients, we compare 2D and 3D ResNet models to predict IDH and MGMT status, using T1, post-contrast T1, and FLAIR MRI sequences. USCF glioma dataset was used, which contains 495 patients with known IDH and 410 patients with known MGMT status. The dataset was divided into training (60%), tuning (20%), and test (20%) subsets at the patient level. The 2D models take axial, coronal, and sagittal tumor slices as three separate models. To ensemble the 2D predictions the three different views were combined using logistic regression. Various ResNet architectures (ResNet10, 18, 34, 50, 101, 152) were trained. For the 3D approach, we incorporated the entire brain tumor volume in the ResNet10, 18, and 34 models. After optimizing each model, the models with the lowest tuning loss were selected for further evaluation on the separate test sets. The best-performing models in IDH prediction were the 2D ResNet50, achieving a test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9096, and the 3D ResNet34, which reached a test AUROC of 0.8999. For MGMT status prediction, the 2D ResNet152 achieved a test AUROC of 0.6168; however, all 3D models yielded AUROCs less than 0.5. Overall, the study indicated that both 2D and 3D models showed high predictive value for IDH prediction, with slightly better performance in 2D models.

Title: Lyapunov-Based Deep Neural Networks for Adaptive Control of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Saiedeh Akbari, Cristian F. Nino, Omkar Sudhir Patil, Warren E. Dixon
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems involves substantial challenges when the dynamics contain unknown and unstructured nonlinear state-dependent terms. For such complex systems, deep neural networks can serve as powerful black box approximators for the unknown drift and diffusion processes. Recent developments construct Lyapunov-based deep neural network (Lb-DNN) controllers to compensate for deterministic uncertainties using adaptive weight update laws derived from a Lyapunov-based analysis based on insights from the compositional structure of the DNN architecture. However, these Lb-DNN controllers do not account for non-deterministic uncertainties. This paper develops Lb-DNNs to adaptively compensate for both the drift and diffusion uncertainties of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems. Through a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a DNN-based approximation and corresponding DNN weight adaptation laws are constructed to eliminate the unknown state-dependent terms resulting from the nonlinear diffusion and drift processes. The tracking error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded in probability. Simulations are performed on a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system to show efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital twins (DT) and 6G networks, the integration of large language models (LLMs) presents a novel approach to network management. This paper explores the application of LLMs in managing 6G-empowered DT networks, with a focus on optimizing data retrieval and communication efficiency in smart city scenarios. The proposed framework leverages LLMs for intelligent DT problem analysis and radio resource management (RRM) in fully autonomous way without any manual intervention. Our proposed framework -- LINKs, builds up a lazy loading strategy which can minimize transmission delay by selectively retrieving the relevant data. Based on the data retrieval plan, LLMs transform the retrieval task into an numerical optimization problem and utilizing solvers to build an optimal RRM, ensuring efficient communication across the network.

Authors: Sajjad Afroosheh, Mohammadreza Askari
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework for remote sensing image analysis by fusing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of spatial data analysis by overcoming challenges associated with high dimensionality, complex patterns, and temporal data processing. We implemented optimization algorithms, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), to fine-tune model parameters, resulting in improved performance metrics. Our findings reveal a significant increase in classification accuracy from 78% to 92% and a reduction in prediction error from 12% to 6% after optimization. Additionally, the temporal accuracy of the models improved from 75% to 88%, showcasing the frameworks capability to monitor dynamic changes effectively. The integration of GIS not only enriched the spatial analysis but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the relationships between geographical features. This research demonstrates that combining advanced deep learning methods with GIS and optimization strategies can significantly advance remote sensing applications, paving the way for future developments in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and resource management.

Title: Mouth Articulation-Based Anchoring for Improved Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Shreya G. Upadhyay, Ali N. Salman, Carlos Busso, Chi-Chun Lee
Abstract: Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in numerous practical applications. Traditional approaches to cross-corpus emotion transfer often concentrate on adapting acoustic features to align with different corpora, domains, or labels. However, acoustic features are inherently variable and error-prone due to factors like speaker differences, domain shifts, and recording conditions. To address these challenges, this study adopts a novel contrastive approach by focusing on emotion-specific articulatory gestures as the core elements for analysis. By shifting the emphasis on the more stable and consistent articulatory gestures, we aim to enhance emotion transfer learning in SER tasks. Our research leverages the CREMA-D and MSP-IMPROV corpora as benchmarks and it reveals valuable insights into the commonality and reliability of these articulatory gestures. The findings highlight mouth articulatory gesture potential as a better constraint for improving emotion recognition across different settings or domains.

Title: Leveraging Scene Geometry and Depth Information for Robust Image Deraining
Authors: Ningning Xu, Jidong J. Yang
Abstract: Image deraining holds great potential for enhancing the vision of autonomous vehicles in rainy conditions, contributing to safer driving. Previous works have primarily focused on employing a single network architecture to generate derained images. However, they often fail to fully exploit the rich prior knowledge embedded in the scenes. Particularly, most methods overlook the depth information that can provide valuable context about scene geometry and guide more robust deraining. In this work, we introduce a novel learning framework that integrates multiple networks: an AutoEncoder for deraining, an auxiliary network to incorporate depth information, and two supervision networks to enforce feature consistency between rainy and clear scenes. This multi-network design enables our model to effectively capture the underlying scene structure, producing clearer and more accurately derained images, leading to improved object detection for autonomous vehicles. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Title: MobileNetV2: A lightweight classification model for home-based sleep apnea screening
Authors: Hui Pan, Yanxuan Yu, Jilun Ye, Xu Zhang
Abstract: This study proposes a novel lightweight neural network model leveraging features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals for early OSA screening. ECG signals are used to generate feature spectrograms to predict sleep stages, while respiratory signals are employed to detect sleep-related breathing abnormalities. By integrating these predictions, the method calculates the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with enhanced accuracy, facilitating precise OSA diagnosis. The method was validated on three publicly available sleep apnea databases: the Apnea-ECG database, the UCDDB dataset, and the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic database. Results showed an overall OSA detection accuracy of 0.978, highlighting the model's robustness. Respiratory event classification achieved an accuracy of 0.969 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.98. For sleep stage classification, in UCDDB dataset, the ROC-AUC exceeded 0.85 across all stages, with recall for Sleep reaching 0.906 and specificity for REM and Wake states at 0.956 and 0.937, respectively. This study underscores the potential of integrating lightweight neural networks with multi-signal analysis for accurate, portable, and cost-effective OSA screening, paving the way for broader adoption in home-based and wearable health monitoring systems.

Abstract: Low altitude economy (LAE) holds immense potential to drive urban development across various sectors. However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.

Title: Global Search of Optimal Spacecraft Trajectories using Amortization and Deep Generative Models
Authors: Ryne Beeson, Anjian Li, Amlan Sinha
Abstract: Preliminary spacecraft trajectory optimization is a parameter dependent global search problem that aims to provide a set of solutions that are of high quality and diverse. In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.

Title: Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC
Authors: Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen
Abstract: This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.

Title: ASE: Practical Acoustic Speed Estimation Beyond Doppler via Sound Diffusion Field
Authors: Sheng Lyu, Chenshu Wu
Abstract: Passive human speed estimation plays a critical role in acoustic sensing. Despite extensive study, existing systems, however, suffer from various limitations: First, previous acoustic speed estimation exploits Doppler Frequency Shifts (DFS) created by moving targets and relies on microphone arrays, making them only capable of sensing the radial speed within a constrained distance. Second, the channel measurement rate proves inadequate to estimate high moving speeds. To overcome these issues, we present ASE, an accurate and robust Acoustic Speed Estimation system on a single commodity microphone. We model the sound propagation from a unique perspective of the acoustic diffusion field, and infer the speed from the acoustic spatial distribution, a completely different way of thinking about speed estimation beyond prior DFS-based approaches. We then propose a novel Orthogonal Time-Delayed Multiplexing (OTDM) scheme for acoustic channel estimation at a high rate that was previously infeasible, making it possible to estimate high speeds. We further develop novel techniques for motion detection and signal enhancement to deliver a robust and practical system. We implement and evaluate ASE through extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that ASE reliably tracks walking speed, independently of target location and direction, with a mean error of 0.13 m/s, a reduction of 2.5x from DFS, and a detection rate of 97.4% for large coverage, e.g., free walking in a 4m $\times$ 4m room. We believe ASE pushes acoustic speed estimation beyond the conventional DFS-based paradigm and will inspire exciting research in acoustic sensing.

Title: Stable-TTS: Stable Speaker-Adaptive Text-to-Speech Synthesis via Prosody Prompting
Authors: Wooseok Han, Minki Kang, Changhun Kim, Eunho Yang
Abstract: Speaker-adaptive Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis has attracted considerable attention due to its broad range of applications, such as personalized voice assistant services. While several approaches have been proposed, they often exhibit high sensitivity to either the quantity or the quality of target speech samples. To address these limitations, we introduce Stable-TTS, a novel speaker-adaptive TTS framework that leverages a small subset of a high-quality pre-training dataset, referred to as prior samples. Specifically, Stable-TTS achieves prosody consistency by leveraging the high-quality prosody of prior samples, while effectively capturing the timbre of the target speaker. Additionally, it employs a prior-preservation loss during fine-tuning to maintain the synthesis ability for prior samples to prevent overfitting on target samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Stable-TTS even under limited amounts of and noisy target speech samples.

Title: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder Framework for End-to-End Communication Systems
Authors: Bolun Zhang, Gan Zheng, Nguyen Van Huynh
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of quantum machine learning to End-to-End (E2E) communication systems in wireless fading scenarios. We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architecture that combines parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder (QAE) framework to optimize the E2E communication system. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system, and reveal that it is the first work that can achieve comparable block error rate (BLER) performance to classical DNN-based and conventional channel coding schemes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, the proposed QAE exhibits steady and superior BLER convergence over the classical autoencoder baseline.

Title: Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization in Multi-resonance Biosensors: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy
Authors: Majid Aalizadeh, Morteza Azmoudeh Afshar, Xudong Fan
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.

Title: An Optimization Driven Link SINR Assurance in RIS-assisted Indoor Networks
Authors: Cao Vien Phung, Max Franke, Ehsan Tohidi, June Heinemann, Andre Drummond, Stefan Schmid, Slawomir Stanczak, Admela Jukan
Abstract: Future smart factories are expected to deploy applications over high-performance indoor wireless channels in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, which on the other hand are susceptible to high path losses and Line-of Sight (LoS) blockages. Low-cost Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can provide great opportunities in such scenarios, due to its ability to alleviate LoS link blockages. In this paper, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, solved with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to optimally maintain connectivity by solving the problem of allocating RIS to robots in a wireless indoor network. Our model exploits the characteristic of nulling interference from RISs by tuning RIS reflection coefficients. We further consider Quality-of-Service (QoS) at receivers in terms of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and connection outages due to insufficient transmission quality service. Numerical results for optimal solutions and heuristics show the benefits of optimally deploying RISs by providing continuous connectivity through SINR, which significantly reduces outages due to link quality.

Title: Convex Data-Driven Contraction With Riemannian Metrics
Authors: Andreas Oliveira, Jian Zheng, Mario Sznaier
Abstract: The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming nonlinearities are lipschitz bounded in subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its potential for robust data-driven contraction.

Title: Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings
Authors: Neophytos Charalambides, Arya Mazumdar
Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.

Title: Hybrid Feedback Control for Global Navigation with Locally Optimal Obstacle Avoidance in n-Dimensional Spaces
Authors: Ishak Cheniouni, Soulaimane Berkane, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: We present a hybrid feedback control framework for autonomous robot navigation in n-dimensional Euclidean spaces cluttered with spherical obstacles. The proposed approach ensures safe navigation and global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the target location by dynamically switching between two operational modes: motion-to-destination and locally optimal obstacle-avoidance. It produces continuous velocity inputs, ensures collision-free trajectories and generates locally optimal obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework is compatible with range sensors, enabling navigation in both a priori known and unknown environments. Extensive simulations in 2D and 3D settings, complemented by experimental validation on a TurtleBot 4 platform, confirm the efficacy and robustness of the approach. Our results demonstrate shorter paths and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency and real-world feasibility.

Title: Slow and fast dynamics in measure functional differential equations with state-dependent delays through averaging principles and applications to extremum seeking
Authors: Jaqueline G. Mesquita, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Henrique C. dos Reis
Abstract: This paper investigates a new class of equations called measure functional differential equations with state-dependent delays. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions and present a discussion concerning the appropriate phase space to define these equations. Also, we prove a version of periodic averaging principle to these equations. This type of result was completely open in the literature. These equations involving measure bring the advantage to encompass others such as impulsive, dynamic equations on time scales and difference equations, expanding their application potential. Additionally, we apply our theoretical insights to a real-time optimization strategy, using extremum seeking to validate the stability of an innovative algorithm under state-dependent delays. This application confirm the relevance of our findings in practical scenarios, offering valuable tools for advanced control system design. Our research provides significant contributions to the mathematical field and suggests new directions for future technological developments.

Title: Tri-Ergon: Fine-grained Video-to-Audio Generation with Multi-modal Conditions and LUFS Control
Authors: Bingliang Li, Fengyu Yang, Yuxin Mao, Qingwen Ye, Hongkai Chen, Yiran Zhong
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation utilizes visual-only video features to produce realistic sounds that correspond to the scene. However, current V2A models often lack fine-grained control over the generated audio, especially in terms of loudness variation and the incorporation of multi-modal conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Tri-Ergon, a diffusion-based V2A model that incorporates textual, auditory, and pixel-level visual prompts to enable detailed and semantically rich audio synthesis. Additionally, we introduce Loudness Units relative to Full Scale (LUFS) embedding, which allows for precise manual control of the loudness changes over time for individual audio channels, enabling our model to effectively address the intricate correlation of video and audio in real-world Foley workflows. Tri-Ergon is capable of creating 44.1 kHz high-fidelity stereo audio clips of varying lengths up to 60 seconds, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art V2A methods that typically generate mono audio for a fixed duration.

Title: Movable Antenna Array Aided Ultra Reliable Covert Communications
Authors: Yida Wang, Guojie Hu, Xiaoling Hu, Xingbo Lu, Yuzhen Huang
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.

Title: Robust targeted exploration for systems with non-stochastic disturbances
Authors: Janani Venkatasubramanian, Johannes Köhler, Mark Cannon, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted exploration strategy designed specifically for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with energy-bounded disturbances, i.e., without making any assumptions on the distribution of the disturbances. We use classical results characterizing the set of non-falsified parameters consistent with energy-bounded disturbances. We derive a semidefinite program which computes an exploration strategy that guarantees a desired accuracy of the parameter estimate. This design is based on sufficient conditions on the spectral content of the exploration data that robustly accounts for initial parametric uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the applicability of the exploration strategy through a numerical example involving an unmodeled nonlinearity.

Title: Single-image reflection removal via self-supervised diffusion models
Authors: Zhengyang Lu, Weifan Wang, Tianhao Guo, Feng Wang
Abstract: Reflections often degrade the visual quality of images captured through transparent surfaces, and reflection removal methods suffers from the shortage of paired real-world this http URL paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines cycle-consistency with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to effectively remove reflections from single images without requiring paired training data. The method introduces a Reflective Removal Network (RRN) that leverages DDPMs to model the decomposition process and recover the transmission image, and a Reflective Synthesis Network (RSN) that re-synthesizes the input image using the separated components through a nonlinear attention-based mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the SIR$^2$, Flash-Based Reflection Removal (FRR) Dataset, and a newly introduced Museum Reflection Removal (MRR) dataset, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Exploiting NOMA Transmissions in Multi-UAV-assisted Wireless Networks: From Aerial-RIS to Mode-switching UAVs
Authors: Songhan Zhao, Shimin Gong, Bo Gu, Lanhua Li, Bin Lyu, Dinh Thai Hoang, Changyan Yi
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted wireless network, where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) collect data from ground users (GUs) by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) method. The ARIS provides enhanced channel controllability to improve the NOMA transmissions and reduce the co-channel interference among UAVs. We also propose a novel dual-mode switching scheme, where each UAV equipped with both an ARIS and a radio frequency (RF) transceiver can adaptively perform passive reflection or active transmission. We aim to maximize the overall network throughput by jointly optimizing the UAVs' trajectory planning and operating modes, the ARIS's passive beamforming, and the GUs' transmission control strategies. We propose an optimization-driven hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (O-HDRL) method to decompose it into a series of subproblems. Specifically, the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) adjusts the UAVs' trajectory planning and mode switching strategies, while the passive beamforming and transmission control strategies are tackled by the optimization methods. Numerical results reveal that the O-HDRL efficiently improves the learning stability and reward performance compared to the benchmark methods. Meanwhile, the dual-mode switching scheme is verified to achieve a higher throughput performance compared to the fixed ARIS scheme.

Title: Enhancing autonomous vehicle safety in rain: a data-centric approach for clear vision
Authors: Mark A. Seferian, Jidong J. Yang
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles face significant challenges in navigating adverse weather, particularly rain, due to the visual impairment of camera-based systems. In this study, we leveraged contemporary deep learning techniques to mitigate these challenges, aiming to develop a vision model that processes live vehicle camera feeds to eliminate rain-induced visual hindrances, yielding visuals closely resembling clear, rain-free scenes. Using the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulation environment, we generated a comprehensive dataset of clear and rainy images for model training and testing. In our model, we employed a classic encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections and concatenation operations. It was trained using novel batching schemes designed to effectively distinguish high-frequency rain patterns from low-frequency scene features across successive image frames. To evaluate the model performance, we integrated it with a steering module that processes front-view images as input. The results demonstrated notable improvements in steering accuracy, underscoring the model's potential to enhance navigation safety and reliability in rainy weather conditions.

Title: Audiopedia: Audio QA with Knowledge
Authors: Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri, Kiran Chhatre, Akshat Jain
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Audiopedia, a novel task called Audio Question Answering with Knowledge, which requires both audio comprehension and external knowledge reasoning. Unlike traditional Audio Question Answering (AQA) benchmarks that focus on simple queries answerable from audio alone, Audiopedia targets knowledge-intensive questions. We define three sub-tasks: (i) Single Audio Question Answering (s-AQA), where questions are answered based on a single audio sample, (ii) Multi-Audio Question Answering (m-AQA), which requires reasoning over multiple audio samples, and (iii) Retrieval-Augmented Audio Question Answering (r-AQA), which involves retrieving relevant audio to answer the question. We benchmark large audio language models (LALMs) on these sub-tasks and observe suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a generic framework that can be adapted to any LALM, equipping them with knowledge reasoning capabilities. Our framework has two components: (i) Audio Entity Linking (AEL) and (ii) Knowledge-Augmented Audio Large Multimodal Model (KA2LM), which together improve performance on knowledge-intensive AQA tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address advanced audio understanding via knowledge-intensive tasks like Audiopedia.

Title: Improved ICNN-LSTM Model Classification Based on Attitude Sensor Data for Hazardous State Assessment of Magnetic Adhesion Climbing Wall Robots
Authors: Zhen Ma, He Xu, Jielong Dou, Yi Qin, Xueyu Zhang
Abstract: Magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots are widely utilized in high-altitude inspection, welding, and cleaning tasks due to their ability to perform various operations against gravity on vertical or inclined walls. However, during operation, the robot may experience overturning torque caused by its own weight and load, which can lead to the detachment of magnetic plates and subsequently pose safety risks. This paper proposes an improved ICNN-LSTM network classification method based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) attitude sensor data for real-time monitoring and assessment of hazardous states in magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots. Firstly, a data acquisition strategy for attitude sensors capable of capturing minute vibrations is designed. Secondly, a feature extraction and classification model combining an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed minute vibration sensing method achieves significant results, and the proposed classification model consistently exhibits high accuracy compared to other models. The research findings provide effective technical support for the safe operation of climbing robots

Title: Online Adaptive Platoon Control for Connected and Automated Vehicles via Physics Enhanced Residual Learning
Authors: Peng Zhang, Heye Huang, Hang Zhou, Haotian Shi, Keke Long, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: This paper introduces a physics enhanced residual learning (PERL) framework for connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon control, addressing the dynamics and unpredictability inherent to platoon systems. The framework first develops a physics-based controller to model vehicle dynamics, using driving speed as input to optimize safety and efficiency. Then the residual controller, based on neural network (NN) learning, enriches the prior knowledge of the physical model and corrects residuals caused by vehicle dynamics. By integrating the physical model with data-driven online learning, the PERL framework retains the interpretability and transparency of physics-based models and enhances the adaptability and precision of data-driven learning, achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and control accuracy in dynamic scenarios. Simulation and robot car platform tests demonstrate that PERL significantly outperforms pure physical and learning models, reducing average cumulative absolute position and speed errors by up to 58.5% and 40.1% (physical model) and 58.4% and 47.7% (NN model). The reduced-scale robot car platform tests further validate the adaptive PERL framework's superior accuracy and rapid convergence under dynamic disturbances, reducing position and speed cumulative errors by 72.73% and 99.05% (physical model) and 64.71% and 72.58% (NN model). PERL enhances platoon control performance through online parameter updates when external disturbances are detected. Results demonstrate the advanced framework's exceptional accuracy and rapid convergence capabilities, proving its effectiveness in maintaining platoon stability under diverse conditions.

Title: Beam Codebook Refinement for mmWave Devices with Random Orientations: Concept and Experimental Validation
Authors: Bora Bozkurt, Ahmet Muaz Aktas, Hasan Atalay Gunel, Mohaned Chraiti, Ali Gorcin, Ibrahim Hokelek
Abstract: There is a growing interest in codebook-based beam-steering for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems due to its potential for low complexity and rapid beam search. A key focus of recent research has been the design of codebooks that strike a trade-off between achievable gain and codebook size, which directly impacts beam search time. Statistical approaches have shown promise by leveraging the likelihood that certain beam directions (equivalently, sets of phase-shifter configurations) are more probable than others. Such approaches are shown to be valid for static, non-rotating transmission stations such as base stations. However, for the case of user terminals that are constantly changing orientation, the possible phase-shifter configurations become equally probable, rendering statistical methods less relevant. On the other hand, user terminals come with a large number of possible steering vector configurations, which can span up to six orders of magnitude. Therefore, efficient solutions to reduce the codebook size (set of possible steering vectors) without compromising array gain are needed. We address this challenge by proposing a novel and practical codebook refinement technique, aiming to reduce the codebook size while maintaining array gain within $\gamma$ dB of the maximum achievable gain at any random orientation of the user terminal. We project that a steering vector at a given angle could effectively cover adjacent angles with a small gain loss compared to the maximum achievable gain. We demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to reduce the codebook size from $1024^{16}$ to just a few configurations (e.g., less than ten), covering all angles while maintaining the gain within $\gamma=3$ dB of the maximum achievable gain.

Title: Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network
Authors: Tianyue Zheng, Linglong Dai
Abstract: The recent advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Recently, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization for different physical layer tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse physical layer tasks introduces extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task physical layer network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish multiple tasks and adapted the features of different formats of wireless data for the features of LLM. Numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: LEO Satellite-Enabled Random Access with Large Differential Delay and Doppler Shift
Authors: Boxiao Shen, Yongpeng Wu, Wenjun Zhang, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection for LEO satellite-enabled grant-free random access systems, specifically targeting scenarios where remote Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices operate without global navigation satellite system (GNSS) assistance. Considering the constrained power consumption of these devices, the large differential delay and Doppler shift are handled at the satellite receiver. We firstly propose a spreading-based multi-frame transmission scheme with orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation to mitigate the doubly dispersive effect in time and frequency, and then analyze the input-output relationship of the system. Next, we propose a receiver structure based on three modules: a linear module for identifying active devices that leverages the generalized approximate message passing algorithm to eliminate inter-user and inter-carrier interference; a non-linear module that employs the message passing algorithm to jointly estimate the channel and detect the transmitted symbols; and a third module that aims to exploit the three dimensional block channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler-angle domain. Soft information is exchanged among the three modules by careful message scheduling. Furthermore, the expectation-maximization algorithm is integrated to adjust phase rotation caused by the fractional Doppler and to learn the hyperparameters in the priors. Finally, the convolutional neural network is incorporated to enhance the symbol detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transmission scheme boosts the system performance, and the designed algorithms outperform the conventional methods significantly in terms of the device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection.

Title: CF-CGN: Channel Fingerprints Extrapolation for Multi-band Massive MIMO Transmission based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Networks
Authors: Chenjie Xie, Li You, Zhenzhou Jin, Jinke Tang, Xiqi Gao, Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: Multi-band massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication can promote the cooperation of licensed and unlicensed spectra, effectively enhancing spectrum efficiency for Wi-Fi and other wireless systems. As an enabler for multi-band transmission, channel fingerprints (CF), also known as the channel knowledge map or radio environment map, are used to assist channel state information (CSI) acquisition and reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CF-CGN (Channel Fingerprints with Cycle-consistent Generative Networks) to extrapolate CF for multi-band massive MIMO transmission where licensed and unlicensed spectra cooperate to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Specifically, we first model CF as a multichannel image and transform the extrapolation problem into an image translation task, which converts CF from one frequency to another by exploring the shared characteristics of statistical CSI in the beam domain. Then, paired generative networks are designed and coupled by variable-weight cycle consistency losses to fit the reciprocal relationship at different bands. Matched with the coupled networks, a joint training strategy is developed accordingly, supporting synchronous optimization of all trainable parameters. During the inference process, we also introduce a refining scheme to improve the extrapolation accuracy based on the resolution of CF. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed CF-CGN can achieve bidirectional extrapolation with an error of 5-17 dB lower than the benchmarks in different communication scenarios, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability. We further show that the sum rate performance assisted by CF-CGN-based CF is close to that with perfect CSI for multi-band massive MIMO transmission.

Title: Language-based Audio Retrieval with Co-Attention Networks
Authors: Haoran Sun, Zimu Wang, Qiuyi Chen, Jianjun Chen, Jia Wang, Haiyang Zhang
Abstract: In recent years, user-generated audio content has proliferated across various media platforms, creating a growing need for efficient retrieval methods that allow users to search for audio clips using natural language queries. This task, known as language-based audio retrieval, presents significant challenges due to the complexity of learning semantic representations from heterogeneous data across both text and audio modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the language-based audio retrieval task that leverages co-attention mechanismto jointly learn meaningful representations from both modalities. To enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, we propose a cascaded co-attention architecture, where co-attention modules are stacked or iterated to progressively refine the semantic alignment between text and audio. Experiments conducted on two public datasets show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, our best performed co-attention model achieves a 16.6% improvement in mean Average Precision on Clotho dataset, and a 15.1% improvement on AudioCaps.

Title: Channel Charting-assisted Non-orthogonal Pilot Allocation for Uplink XL-MIMO Transmission
Authors: Haohong Che, Li You, Jue Wang, Zhenzhou Jin, Chenjie Xie, Xiqi Gao
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is critical to future wireless networks. The substantial increase in the number of base station (BS) antennas introduces near-field propagation effects in the wireless channels, complicating channel parameter estimation and increasing pilot overhead. Channel charting (CC) has emerged as a potent unsupervised technique to effectively harness varying high-dimensional channel statistics to enable non-orthogonal pilot assignment and reduce pilot overhead. In this paper, we investigate near-field channel estimation with reduced pilot overhead by developing a CC-assisted pilot scheduling. To this end, we introduce a polar-domain codebook to capture the power distribution of near-field XL-MIMO channels. The CC-assisted approach uses such features as inputs to enable an effective low-dimensional mapping of the inherent correlation patterns in near-field user terminal (UT) channels. Building upon the mapped channel correlations, we further propose a near-field CC-assisted pilot allocation (NCC-PA) algorithm, which efficiently enhances channel orthogonality among pilot-reusing UTs. Numerical results confirm that the NCC-PA algorithm substantially elevates the wireless transmission performance, offering a marked improvement over the conventional far-field CC-PA approach.

Title: FPGA-based Acceleration of Neural Network for Image Classification using Vitis AI
Authors: Zhengdong Li, Frederick Ziyang Hong, C. Patrick Yue
Abstract: In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted in computer vision. Complex CNN architecture running on CPU or GPU has either insufficient throughput or prohibitive power consumption. Hence, there is a need to have dedicated hardware to accelerate the computation workload to solve these limitations. In this paper, we accelerate a CNN for image classification with the CIFAR-10 dataset using Vitis-AI on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA evaluation board. The work achieves 3.33-5.82x higher throughput and 3.39-6.30x higher energy efficiency than CPU and GPU baselines. It shows the potential to extract 2D features for downstream tasks, such as depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.

Title: DeepF-fNet: a physics-informed neural network for vibration isolation optimization
Authors: A. Tollardo, F. Cadini, M. Giglio, L. Lomazzi
Abstract: Structural optimization is essential for designing safe, efficient, and durable components with minimal material usage. Traditional methods for vibration control often rely on active systems to mitigate unpredictable vibrations, which may lead to resonance and potential structural failure. However, these methods face significant challenges when addressing the nonlinear inverse eigenvalue problems required for optimizing structures subjected to a wide range of frequencies. As a result, no existing approach has effectively addressed the need for real-time vibration suppression within this context, particularly in high-performance environments such as automotive noise, vibration and harshness, where computational efficiency is crucial. This study introduces DeepF-fNet, a novel neural network framework designed to replace traditional active systems in vibration-based structural optimization. Leveraging DeepONets within the context of physics-informed neural networks, DeepF-fNet integrates both data and the governing physical laws. This enables rapid identification of optimal parameters to suppress critical vibrations at specific frequencies, offering a more efficient and real-time alternative to conventional methods. The proposed framework is validated through a case study involving a locally resonant metamaterial used to isolate structures from user-defined frequency ranges. The results demonstrate that DeepF-fNet outperforms traditional genetic algorithms in terms of computational speed while achieving comparable results, making it a promising tool for vibration-sensitive applications. By replacing active systems with machine learning techniques, DeepF-fNet paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective structural optimization in real-world scenarios.

Title: Adversarial Attack and Defense for LoRa Device Identification and Authentication via Deep Learning
Authors: Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek
Abstract: LoRa provides long-range, energy-efficient communications in Internet of Things (IoT) applications that rely on Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) capabilities. Despite these merits, concerns persist regarding the security of LoRa networks, especially in situations where device identification and authentication are imperative to secure the reliable access to the LoRa networks. This paper explores a deep learning (DL) approach to tackle these concerns, focusing on two critical tasks, namely (i) identifying LoRa devices and (ii) classifying them to legitimate and rogue devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs), encompassing both convolutional and feedforward neural networks, are trained for these tasks using actual LoRa signal data. In this setting, the adversaries may spoof rogue LoRa signals through the kernel density estimation (KDE) method based on legitimate device signals that are received by the adversaries. Two cases are considered, (i) training two separate classifiers, one for each of the two tasks, and (ii) training a multi-task classifier for both tasks. The vulnerabilities of the resulting DNNs to manipulations in input samples are studied in form of untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Individual and common perturbations are considered against single-task and multi-task classifiers for the LoRa signal analysis. To provide resilience against such attacks, a defense approach is presented by increasing the robustness of classifiers with adversarial training. Results quantify how vulnerable LoRa signal classification tasks are to adversarial attacks and emphasize the need to fortify IoT applications against these subtle yet effective threats.

Title: Two-component spatiotemporal template for activation-inhibition of speech in ECoG
Authors: Eric Easthope
Abstract: I compute the average trial-by-trial power of band-limited speech activity across epochs of multi-channel high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded from multiple subjects during a consonant-vowel speaking task. I show that previously seen anti-correlations of average beta frequency activity (12-35 Hz) to high-frequency gamma activity (70-140 Hz) during speech movement are observable between individual ECoG channels in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC). With this I fit a variance-based model using principal component analysis to the band-powers of individual channels of session-averaged ECoG data in the SMC and project SMC channels onto their lower-dimensional principal components. Spatiotemporal relationships between speech-related activity and principal components are identified by correlating the principal components of both frequency bands to individual ECoG channels over time using windowed correlation. Correlations of principal component areas to sensorimotor areas reveal a distinct two-component activation-inhibition-like representation for speech that resembles distinct local sensorimotor areas recently shown to have complex interplay in whole-body motor control, inhibition, and posture. Notably the third principal component shows insignificant correlations across all subjects, suggesting two components of ECoG are sufficient to represent SMC activity during speech movement.

Title: Deep Learning with Uncertainty Quantification for Predicting the Segmentation Dice Coefficient of Prostate Cancer Biopsy Images
Authors: Audrey Xie, Elhoucine Elfatimi, Sambuddha Ghosal, Pratik Shah
Abstract: Deep learning models (DLMs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance in histopathology image segmentation and classification, but have limited deployment potential in real-world clinical settings. Uncertainty estimates of DLMs can increase trust by identifying predictions and images that need further review. Dice scores and coefficients (Dice) are benchmarks for evaluation of image segmentation performance, but are usually not evaluated with DLM uncertainty quantification. This study reports DLMs trained with uncertainty estimations, using randomly initialized weights and Monte Carlo dropout, to segment tumors from microscopic Hematoxylin and Eosin dye stained prostate core biopsy histology RGB images. Image-level maps showed significant correlation (Spearman's rank, p < 0.05) between overall and specific prostate tissue image sub-region uncertainties with model performance estimations by Dice. This study reports that linear models, which can predict Dice segmentation scores from multiple clinical sub-region-based uncertainties of prostate cancer, can serve as a more comprehensive performance evaluation metric without loss in predictive capability of DLMs, with a low root mean square error.

Title: Potential detrimental effects of real-time route recommendations in traffic networks
Authors: Tommaso Toso, Alain Y. Kibangou, Paolo Frasca
Abstract: Navigation apps have become pervasive in providing real-time route recommendations to travelers willing to minimize their travel times. However, such technologies introduce new complexities, raising concerns about their overall impact on traffic networks. This paper focuses on evaluating the effect of navigation apps on traffic flows, particularly examining how real-time route recommendations influence network efficiency and congestion. Using a dynamical network flow model, we study traffic dynamics between an origin-destination pair, where a fraction of drivers follow app recommendations while others rely on fixed route preferences. By incorporating supply-demand mechanisms to account for capacity and volume constraints on routes, we uncover partial demand transfer, i.e., only a portion of the traffic demand is able to traverse the network, while the rest builds up congestion at the origin. We prove that the dynamics converges to a globally stable equilibrium and we provide a detailed analysis of this equilibrium when the choices of the informed drivers follow a logit model, correlating the emergence of partial demand transfer to the penetration rate of navigation apps among users.

Title: Learning with Delayed Payoffs in Population Games using Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularization
Authors: Shinkyu Park, Naomi Ehrich Leonard
Abstract: We study a multi-agent decision problem in large population games. Agents from multiple populations select strategies for repeated interactions with one another. At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays, conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.

Title: Neural Networks for Fast Optimisation in Model Predictive Control: A Review
Authors: Camilo Gonzalez (1), Houshyar Asadi (1), Lars Kooijman (2), Chee Peng Lim (3) ((1) Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Australia, (2) Opportunity Tech Lab, Monash University, Caulfield East, Australia, (3) Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Australia)
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control algorithm with strong stability and robustness guarantees. Despite its popularity in robotics and industrial applications, the main challenge in deploying MPC is its high computation cost, stemming from the need to solve an optimisation problem at each control interval. There are several methods to reduce this cost. This survey focusses on approaches where a neural network is used to approximate an existing controller. Herein, relevant and unique neural approximation methods for linear, nonlinear, and robust MPC are presented and compared. Comparisons are based on the theoretical guarantees that are preserved, the factor by which the original controller is sped up, and the size of problem that a framework is applicable to. Research contributions include: a taxonomy that organises existing knowledge, a summary of literary gaps, discussion on promising research directions, and simple guidelines for choosing an approximation framework. The main conclusions are that (1) new benchmarking tools are needed to help prove the generalisability and scalability of approximation frameworks, (2) future breakthroughs most likely lie in the development of ties between control and learning, and (3) the potential and applicability of recently developed neural architectures and tools remains unexplored in this field.

Title: Finite-Time Adaptive Fuzzy Tracking Control for Nonlinear State Constrained Pure-Feedback Systems
Authors: Ju Wu, Tong Wang, Min Ma
Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-time adaptive fuzzy tracking control problem for a class of pure-feedback system with full-state constraints. With the help of Mean-Value Theorem, the pure-feedback nonlinear system is transformed into strict-feedback case. By employing finite-time-stable like function and state transformation for output tracking error, the output tracking error converges to a predefined set in a fixed finite interval. To tackle the problem of state constraints, integral Barrier Lyapunov functions are utilized to guarantee that the state variables remain within the prescribed constraints with feasibility check. Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. In addition, all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be semi-global ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Title: Adaptive Fuzzy Tracking Control for Nonlinear State Constrained Pure-Feedback Systems With Input Delay via Dynamic Surface Technique
Authors: Ju Wu, Tong Wang
Abstract: This brief constructs the adaptive backstepping control scheme for a class of pure-feedback systems with input delay and full state constraints. With the help of Mean Value Theorem, the pure-feedback system is transformed into strict-feedback one. Barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to guarantee all of the states remain constrained within predefined sets. By introducing the Pade approximation method and corresponding intermediate, the impact generated by input delay on the output tracking performance of the system can be eliminated. Furthermore, a low-pass filter driven by a newly-defined control input, is employed to generate the actual control input, which facilitates the design of backstepping control. To approximate the unknown functions with a desired level of accuracy, the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized by choosing appropriate fuzzy rules, logics and so on. The minimal learning parameter (MLP) technique is employed to decrease the number of nodes and parameters in FLSs, and dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is leveraged to avoid so-called "explosion of complexity". Moreover, smooth robust compensators are introduced to circumvent the influences of external disturbance and approximation errors. By stability analysis, it is proved that all of signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally ultimately uniform bounded, and the tracking error can be within a arbitrary small neighbor of origin via selecting appropriate parameters of controllers. Finally, the results of numerical illustration are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed method.

Title: Epidemic Population Games And Perturbed Best Response Dynamics
Authors: Shinkyu Park, Jair Certorio, Nuno C. Martins, Richard J. La
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to mitigate epidemic spread in a population of strategic agents by encouraging safer behaviors through carefully designed rewards. These rewards, which adapt to the evolving state of the epidemic, are ascribed by a dynamic payoff mechanism we seek to design. We use a modified SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents' strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population's strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents' perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic's spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism's dynamics. Additionally, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost. For a class of one-parameter perturbed best response models, we propose a method to learn the model's parameter from data.

Title: Low-Overhead Channel Estimation via 3D Extrapolation for TDD mmWave Massive MIMO Systems Under High-Mobility Scenarios
Authors: Binggui Zhou, Xi Yang, Shaodan Ma, Feifei Gao, Guanghua Yang
Abstract: In time division duplexing (TDD) millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink channel state information (CSI) can be obtained from uplink channel estimation thanks to channel reciprocity. However, under high-mobility scenarios, frequent uplink channel estimation is needed due to channel aging. Additionally, large amounts of antennas and subcarriers result in high-dimensional CSI matrices, aggravating pilot training overhead. To address this, we propose a three-domain (3D) channel extrapolation framework across spatial, frequency, and temporal domains. First, considering the effectiveness of traditional knowledge-driven channel estimation methods and the marginal effects of pilots in the spatial and frequency domains, a knowledge-and-data driven spatial-frequency channel extrapolation network (KDD-SFCEN) is proposed for uplink channel estimation via joint spatial-frequency channel extrapolation to reduce spatial-frequency domain pilot overhead. Then, leveraging channel reciprocity and temporal dependencies, we propose a temporal uplink-downlink channel extrapolation network (TUDCEN) powered by generative artificial intelligence for slot-level channel extrapolation, aiming to reduce the tremendous temporal domain pilot overhead caused by high mobility. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in significantly reducing the pilot training overhead by 16 times and improving the system's spectral efficiency under high-mobility scenarios compared with state-of-the-art channel estimation/extrapolation methods.

Title: An Approximate Wave-Number Domain Expression for Near-Field XL-array Channel
Authors: Hongbo Xing, Yuxiang Zhang, Jianhua Zhang, Huixin Xu, Guangyi Liu, Qixing Wang
Abstract: As Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) technology advances and carrier frequency rises, the near-field effects in communication are intensifying. In near-field conditions, channels exhibit a diffusion phenomenon in the angular domain, existing research indicates that this phenomenon can be leveraged for efficient parameter estimation and beam training. However, the channel model in angular domain lacks closed-form analysis, making the time complexity of the corresponding algorithm high. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the near-field diffusion effect in the wave-number domain, where the wave-number domain can be viewed as the continuous form of the angular domain. A closed-form approximate wave-number domain expression is proposed, based on the Principle of Stationary Phase. Subsequently, we derive a simplified expression for the case where the user distance is much larger than the array aperture, which is more concise. Subsequently, we verify the accuracy of the proposed approximate expression through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness using a beam training example. Results indicate that the beam training scheme, improved by the wave-number domain approximation model, can effectively estimate near-field user parameters and perform beam training using far-field DFT codebooks. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of existing DFT codebook-based beam training methods.

Title: ESI-GAL: EEG Source Imaging-based Trajectory Estimation for Grasp and Lift Task
Authors: Anant Jain, Lalan Kumar
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.

Title: Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication
Authors: Mats Gustafsson
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.

Title: Timing Analysis and Priority-driven Enhancements of ROS 2 Multi-threaded Executors
Authors: Hoora Sobhani, Hyunjong Choi, Hyoseung Kim
Abstract: The second generation of Robotic Operating System, ROS 2, has gained much attention for its potential to be used for safety-critical robotic applications. The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2 multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical bounds.

Title: Zak-OTFS with Interleaved Pilots to Extend the Region of Predictable Operation
Authors: Jinu Jayachandran, Imran Ali Khan, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: When the delay period of the Zak-OTFS carrier is greater than the delay spread of the channel, and the Doppler period of the carrier is greater than the Doppler spread of the channel, the effective channel filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single pilot carrier waveform. The input-output (I/O) relation can then be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. We introduce a framework for pilot design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain which makes it possible to support users with very different delay-Doppler characteristics when it is not possible to choose a single delay and Doppler period to support all users. The method is to interleave single pilots in the DD domain, and to choose the pilot spacing so that the I/O relation can be reconstructed by solving a small linear system of equations.

Title: EEG Right & Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach
Authors: Biplov Paneru, Bipul Thapa, Bishwash Paneru, Sanjog Chhetri Sapkota
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.

Title: EigenSR: Eigenimage-Bridged Pre-Trained RGB Learners for Single Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Xi Su, Xiangfei Shen, Mingyang Wan, Jing Nie, Lihui Chen, Haijun Liu, Xichuan Zhou
Abstract: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single-HSI-SR) aims to improve the resolution of a single input low-resolution HSI. Due to the bottleneck of data scarcity, the development of single-HSI-SR lags far behind that of RGB natural images. In recent years, research on RGB SR has shown that models pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets can greatly improve performance on unseen data, which may stand as a remedy for HSI. But how can we transfer the pre-trained RGB model to HSI, to overcome the data-scarcity bottleneck? Because of the significant difference in the channels between the pre-trained RGB model and the HSI, the model cannot focus on the correlation along the spectral dimension, thus limiting its ability to utilize on HSI. Inspired by the HSI spatial-spectral decoupling, we propose a new framework that first fine-tunes the pre-trained model with the spatial components (known as eigenimages), and then infers on unseen HSI using an iterative spectral regularization (ISR) to maintain the spectral correlation. The advantages of our method lie in: 1) we effectively inject the spatial texture processing capabilities of the pre-trained RGB model into HSI while keeping spectral fidelity, 2) learning in the spectral-decorrelated domain can improve the generalizability to spectral-agnostic data, and 3) our inference in the eigenimage domain naturally exploits the spectral low-rank property of HSI, thereby reducing the complexity. This work bridges the gap between pre-trained RGB models and HSI via eigenimages, addressing the issue of limited HSI training data, hence the name EigenSR. Extensive experiments show that EigenSR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both spatial and spectral metrics.

Title: E-Sort: Empowering End-to-end Neural Network for Multi-channel Spike Sorting with Transfer Learning and Fast Post-processing
Authors: Yuntao Han, Shiwei Wang
Abstract: Decoding extracellular recordings is a crucial task in electrophysiology and brain-computer interfaces. Spike sorting, which distinguishes spikes and their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, becomes computationally demanding with the increasing number of channels in modern neural probes. To address the intensive workload and complex neuron interactions, we propose E-Sort, an end-to-end neural network-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing. Our framework reduces the required number of annotated spikes for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.68% higher accuracy. Additionally, our novel post-processing algorithm is compatible with deep learning frameworks, making E-Sort significantly faster than state-of-the-art spike sorters. On synthesized Neuropixels recordings, E-Sort achieves comparable accuracy with Kilosort4 while sorting 50 seconds of data in only 1.32 seconds. Our method demonstrates robustness across various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift conditions, offering a substantial improvement in both accuracy and runtime efficiency compared to existing spike sorters.

Title: A Multi-Agent Multi-Environment Mixed Q-Learning for Partially Decentralized Wireless Network Optimization
Authors: Talha Bozkus, Urbashi Mitra
Abstract: Q-learning is a powerful tool for network control and policy optimization in wireless networks, but it struggles with large state spaces. Recent advancements, like multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ), improves performance and reduces complexity by integrating multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple related environments so-called digital cousins. However, MEMQ is designed for centralized single-agent networks and is not suitable for decentralized or multi-agent networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ algorithm for partially decentralized wireless networks with multiple mobile transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs), where TXs do not have access to each other's states and actions. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state based on local observations and share limited information with leader TX to minimize joint cost. The cost of information sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. The proposed scheme is 50% faster than centralized MEMQ with only a 20% increase in average policy error (APE) and is 25% faster than several advanced decentralized Q-learning algorithms with 40% less APE. The convergence of the algorithm is also demonstrated.

Title: A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated. Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels. We recognize that any RIS control circuit can always be separated into its static parts (SLC) and a set of tunable individual loads (IL). Therefore, a BD-RIS-parametrized channel results from the chain cascade of three systems: i) radio environment (RE), ii) SLC, and iii) IL. RE and SLC are static non-diagonal systems whose cascade K is terminated by the tunable diagonal system IL. This physics-compliant representation in terms of K and IL is directly analogous to that for conventional ("diagonal") RIS (D-RIS). Therefore, scenarios with BD-RIS can also readily be captured by the physics-compliant coupled-dipole model PhysFad, as we show. In addition, physics-compliant algorithms for system-level optimization with D-RIS can be directly applied to scenarios with BD-RIS. We demonstrate this important implication of our conceptual finding in a case study on end-to-end channel estimation and optimization in a BD-RIS-parametrized rich-scattering environment. Our case study is the first experimentally grounded system-level optimization for BD-RIS: We obtain the characteristics of RE and IL from experimental measurements and a commercial PIN diode, respectively. Altogether, our physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS enables a paradigm shift in how practitioners in wireless communications and signal processing implement system-level optimizations for BD-RIS because it enables them to directly apply existing physics-compliant D-RIS algorithms.

Title: Frequency-Based Federated Domain Generalization for Polyp Segmentation
Authors: Hongyi Pan, Debesh Jha, Koushik Biswas, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful strategy for training machine learning models across decentralized datasets while maintaining data privacy, yet domain shifts among clients can degrade performance, particularly in medical imaging tasks like polyp segmentation. This paper introduces a novel Frequency-Based Domain Generalization (FDG) framework, utilizing soft-thresholding and hard-thresholding in the Fourier domain to address these challenges. By applying soft-thresholding and hard-thresholding to Fourier coefficients, our method generates new images with reduced background noise and enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and domain robustness over baseline methods. This innovation integrates frequency domain techniques into FL, presenting a resilient approach to overcoming domain variability in decentralized medical image analysis.

Title: Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil
Authors: Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia
Abstract: Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.

Title: Movable Antenna Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Wanting Lyu, Songjie Yang, Yue Xiu, Zhongpei Zhang, Chadi Assi, Chau Yuen
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.

Title: DCF-DS: Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation for Speech Recognition under Realistic Single-Channel Conditions
Authors: Shu-Tong Niu, Jun Du, Ruo-Yu Wang, Gao-Bin Yang, Tian Gao, Jia Pan, Yu Hu
Abstract: We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.

Title: Recommender systems and reinforcement learning for human-building interaction and context-aware support: A text mining-driven review of scientific literature
Authors: Wenhao Zhang, Matias Quintana, Clayton Miller
Abstract: The indoor environment significantly impacts human health and well-being; enhancing health and reducing energy consumption in these settings is a central research focus. With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to thoroughly examine the connections among these approaches in the context of human-building interaction and occupant context-aware support. The study analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Although these systems are broadly applied to specific content, their use in optimizing indoor environments and energy efficiency remains limited. This gap likely arises from the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and extensive sensor data. Traditional recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based and knowledge-based methods, are commonly employed. However, the more complex challenges of optimizing indoor conditions and energy efficiency often depend on sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques like reinforcement and deep learning. Furthermore, this review underscores the vast potential for expanding recommender systems and RL applications in buildings and indoor environments. Fields ripe for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendation, and optimization of environments tailored for specific needs, such as sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback.

Title: Supertoroid fitting of objects with holes for robotic grasping and scene generation
Authors: Joan Badia Torres, Eric Carmona, Abhijit Makhal, Omid Heidari, Alba Perez Gracia
Abstract: One of the strategies to detect the pose and shape of unknown objects is their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities. Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders, but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to a wider variety of shapes. One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole. Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric modeling.

Title: A Cascaded Dilated Convolution Approach for Mpox Lesion Classification
Authors: Ayush Deshmukh
Abstract: The global outbreak of the Mpox virus, classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization, presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its visual similarity to other skin lesion diseases. Traditional diagnostic methods for Mpox, which rely on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, are slow and labor intensive. Deep learning-based approaches for skin lesion classification offer a promising alternative. However, developing a model that balances efficiency with accuracy is crucial to ensure reliable and timely diagnosis without compromising performance. This study introduces the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) framework to address these challenges, combining the Cascaded Atrous Attention module and the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism. The Cascaded Atrous Attention module utilizes dilated convolutions and cascades the outputs to enhance multi-scale representation. This is integrated into the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism, which reduces redundancy in Multi-Head Self-Attention. By integrating the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention module with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an accuracy of 98% on the Mpox Close Skin Image (MCSI) dataset while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. The model's robustness is demonstrated through extensive validation on two additional benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing approaches.

Title: Probabilistic GOSPA: A Metric for Performance Evaluation of Multi-Object Filters with Uncertainties
Authors: Yuxuan Xia, Ángel F. García-Fernández, Johan Karlsson, Ting Yuan, Kuo-Chu Chang, Lennart Svensson
Abstract: This correspondence presents a probabilistic generalization of the Generalized Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (GOSPA) metric, termed P-GOSPA. The GOSPA metric is widely used to evaluate the distance between finite sets, particularly in multi-object estimation applications. The P-GOSPA extends GOSPA into the space of multi-Bernoulli densities, incorporating inherent uncertainty in probabilistic multi-object representations. Additionally, P-GOSPA retains the interpretability of GOSPA, such as its decomposition into localization, missed detection, and false detection errors in a sound and meaningful manner. Examples and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed P-GOSPA metric.

Title: BS-LDM: Effective Bone Suppression in High-Resolution Chest X-Ray Images with Conditional Latent Diffusion Models
Authors: Yifei Sun, Zhanghao Chen, Hao Zheng, Wenming Deng, Jin Liu, Wenwen Min, Ahmed Elazab, Xiang Wan, Changmiao Wang, Ruiquan Ge
Abstract: Lung diseases represent a significant global health challenge, with Chest X-Ray (CXR) being a key diagnostic tool due to their accessibility and affordability. Nonetheless, the detection of pulmonary lesions is often hindered by overlapping bone structures in CXR images, leading to potential misdiagnoses. To address this issue, we developed an end-to-end framework called BS-LDM, designed to effectively suppress bone in high-resolution CXR images. This framework is based on conditional latent diffusion models and incorporates a multi-level hybrid loss-constrained vector-quantized generative adversarial network which is crafted for perceptual compression, ensuring the preservation of details. To further enhance the framework's performance, we introduce offset noise and a temporal adaptive thresholding strategy. These additions help minimize discrepancies in generating low-frequency information, thereby improving the clarity of the generated soft tissue images. Additionally, we have compiled a high-quality bone suppression dataset named SZCH-X-Rays. This dataset includes 818 pairs of high-resolution CXR and dual-energy subtraction soft tissue images collected from a partner hospital. Moreover, we processed 241 data pairs from the JSRT dataset into negative images, which are more commonly used in clinical practice. Our comprehensive experimental and clinical evaluations reveal that BS-LDM excels in bone suppression, underscoring its significant clinical value.

Title: Optimizing Prompt Strategies for SAM: Advancing lesion Segmentation Across Diverse Medical Imaging Modalities
Authors: Yuli Wang, Victoria Shi, Wen-Chi Hsu, Yuwei Dai, Sophie Yao, Zhusi Zhong, Zishu Zhang, Jing Wu, Aaron Maxwell, Scott Collins, Zhicheng Jiao, Harrison X. Bai
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate various Segmental Anything Model (SAM) prompt strategies across four lesions datasets and to subsequently develop a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize SAM prompt placement. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included patients with four independent ovarian, lung, renal, and breast tumor datasets. Manual segmentation and SAM-assisted segmentation were performed for all lesions. A RL model was developed to predict and select SAM points to maximize segmentation performance. Statistical analysis of segmentation was conducted using pairwise t-tests. Results: Results show that increasing the number of prompt points significantly improves segmentation accuracy, with Dice coefficients rising from 0.272 for a single point to 0.806 for five or more points in ovarian tumors. The prompt location also influenced performance, with surface and union-based prompts outperforming center-based prompts, achieving mean Dice coefficients of 0.604 and 0.724 for ovarian and breast tumors, respectively. The RL agent achieved a peak Dice coefficient of 0.595 for ovarian tumors, outperforming random and alternative RL strategies. Additionally, it significantly reduced segmentation time, achieving a nearly 10-fold improvement compared to manual methods using SAM. Conclusion: While increased SAM prompts and non-centered prompts generally improved segmentation accuracy, each pathology and modality has specific optimal thresholds and placement strategies. Our RL agent achieved superior performance compared to other agents while achieving a significant reduction in segmentation time.

Title: Neural Directed Speech Enhancement with Dual Microphone Array in High Noise Scenario
Authors: Wen Wen, Qiang Zhou, Yu Xi, Haoyu Li, Ziqi Gong, Kai Yu
Abstract: In multi-speaker scenarios, leveraging spatial features is essential for enhancing target speech. While with limited microphone arrays, developing a compact multi-channel speech enhancement system remains challenging, especially in extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this issue, we propose a triple-steering spatial selection method, a flexible framework that uses three steering vectors to guide enhancement and determine the enhancement range. Specifically, we introduce a causal-directed U-Net (CDUNet) model, which takes raw multi-channel speech and the desired enhancement width as inputs. This enables dynamic adjustment of steering vectors based on the target direction and fine-tuning of the enhancement region according to the angular separation between the target and interference signals. Our model with only a dual microphone array, excels in both speech quality and downstream task performance. It operates in real-time with minimal parameters, making it ideal for low-latency, on-device streaming applications.

Title: Decentralized Upper Confidence Bound Algorithms for Homogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits
Authors: Jingxuan Zhu, Ethan Mulle, Christopher S. Smith, Alec Koppel, Ji Liu
Abstract: This paper studies a decentralized homogeneous multi-armed bandit problem in a multi-agent network. The problem is simultaneously solved by $N$ agents assuming they face a common set of $M$ arms and share the same arms' reward distributions. Each agent can receive information only from its neighbors, where the neighbor relationships among the agents are described by a fixed graph. Two fully decentralized upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms are proposed for undirected graphs, respectively based on the classic algorithm and the state-of-the-art Kullback-Leibler upper confidence bound (KL-UCB) algorithm. The proposed decentralized UCB1 and KL-UCB algorithms permit each agent in the network to achieve a better logarithmic asymptotic regret than their single-agent counterparts, provided that the agent has at least one neighbor, and the more neighbors an agent has, the better regret it will have, meaning that the sum is more than its component parts. The same algorithm design framework is also extended to directed graphs through the design of a variant of the decentralized UCB1 algorithm, which outperforms the single-agent UCB1 algorithm.

Title: Online Learning and Control for Data-Augmented Quadrotor Model
Authors: Matej Smid, Jindrich Dunik
Abstract: The ability to adapt to changing conditions is a key feature of a successful autonomous system. In this work, we use the Recursive Gaussian Processes (RGP) for identification of the quadrotor air drag model online, without the need of training data. The identified drag model then augments a physics-based model of the quadrotor dynamics, which allows more accurate quadrotor state prediction with increased ability to adapt to changing conditions. This data-augmented physics-based model is utilized for precise quadrotor trajectory tracking using the suitably modified Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The proposed modelling and control approach is evaluated using the Gazebo simulator and it is shown that the proposed approach tracks a desired trajectory with a higher accuracy compared to the MPC with the non-augmented (purely physics-based) model.

Title: Face-StyleSpeech: Enhancing Zero-shot Speech Synthesis from Face Images with Improved Face-to-Speech Mapping
Authors: Minki Kang, Wooseok Han, Eunho Yang
Abstract: Generating speech from a face image is crucial for developing virtual humans capable of interacting using their unique voices, without relying on pre-recorded human speech. In this paper, we propose Face-StyleSpeech, a zero-shot Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis model that generates natural speech conditioned on a face image rather than reference speech. We hypothesize that learning entire prosodic features from a face image poses a significant challenge. To address this, our TTS model incorporates both face and prosody encoders. The prosody encoder is specifically designed to model speech style characteristics that are not fully captured by the face image, allowing the face encoder to focus on extracting speaker-specific features such as timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that Face-StyleSpeech effectively generates more natural speech from a face image than baselines, even for unseen faces. Samples are available on our demo page.

Title: Towards Semi-Autonomous Robotic Arm Manipulation Operator Intention Detection from Force Data
Authors: Abdullah Alharthi, Ozan Tokatli, Erwin Lopez, Guido Herrmann
Abstract: In hazardous environments like nuclear facilities, robotic systems are essential for executing tasks that would otherwise expose humans to dangerous radiation levels, which pose severe health risks and can be fatal. However, many operations in the nuclear environment require teleoperating robots, resulting in a significant cognitive load on operators as well as physical strain over extended periods of time. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing the teleoperation system with an assistive model capable of predicting operator intentions and dynamically adapting to their needs. The machine learning model processes robotic arm force data, analyzing spatiotemporal patterns to accurately detect the ongoing task before its completion. To support this approach, we collected a diverse dataset from teleoperation experiments involving glovebox tasks in nuclear applications. This dataset encompasses heterogeneous spatiotemporal data captured from the teleoperation system. We employ a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to learn and forecast operator intentions based on the spatiotemporal data. By accurately predicting these intentions, the robot can execute tasks more efficiently and effectively, requiring minimal input from the operator. Our experiments validated the model using the dataset, focusing on tasks such as radiation surveys and object grasping. The proposed approach demonstrated an F1-score of 89% for task classification and an F1-score of 86% classification forecasted operator intentions over a 5-second window. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve the safety, precision, and efficiency of robotic operations in hazardous environments, thereby significantly reducing human radiation exposure.

Title: Measuring Audio Prompt Adherence with Distribution-based Embedding Distances
Authors: Maarten Grachten
Abstract: An increasing number of generative music models can be conditioned on an audio prompt that serves as musical context for which the model is to create an accompaniment (often further specified using a text prompt). Evaluation of how well model outputs adhere to the audio prompt is often done in a model or problem specific manner, presumably because no generic evaluation method for audio prompt adherence has emerged. Such a method could be useful both in the development and training of new models, and to make performance comparable across models. In this paper we investigate whether commonly used distribution-based distances like Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), can be used to measure audio prompt adherence. We propose a simple procedure based on a small number of constituents (an embedding model, a projection, an embedding distance, and a data fusion method), that we systematically assess using a baseline validation. In a follow-up experiment we test the sensitivity of the proposed audio adherence measure to pitch and time shift perturbations. The results show that the proposed measure is sensitive to such perturbations, even when the reference and candidate distributions are from different music collections. Although more experimentation is needed to answer unaddressed questions like the robustness of the measure to acoustic artifacts that do not affect the audio prompt adherence, the current results suggest that distribution-based embedding distances provide a viable way of measuring audio prompt adherence. An python/pytorch implementation of the proposed measure is publicly available as a github repository.

Title: Dynamic Importance Learning using Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for Nonlinear Dynamic Mapping
Authors: Vahid MohammadZadeh Eivaghi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli
Abstract: Understanding output variance is critical in modeling nonlinear dynamic systems, as it reflects the system's sensitivity to input variations and feature interactions. This work presents a methodology for dynamically determining relevance scores in black-box models while ensuring interpretability through an embedded decision module. This interpretable module, integrated into the first layer of the model, employs the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and logistic regression to compute relevance scores, interpreted as the probabilities of input neurons being active based on their contribution to the output variance. The proposed method leverages a gradient-based framework to uncover the importance of variance-driven features, capturing both individual contributions and complex feature interactions. These relevance scores are applied through element-wise transformations of the inputs, enabling the black-box model to prioritize features dynamically based on their impact on system output. This approach effectively bridges interpretability with the intricate modeling of nonlinear dynamics and time-dependent interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the method's ability to infer feature interactions while achieving superior performance in feature relevance compared to existing techniques. The practical utility of this approach is showcased through its application to an industrial pH neutralization process, where critical system dynamics are uncovered.

Title: Multimodal Fusion and Coherence Modeling for Video Topic Segmentation
Authors: Hai Yu, Chong Deng, Qinglin Zhang, Jiaqing Liu, Qian Chen, Wen Wang
Abstract: The video topic segmentation (VTS) task segments videos into intelligible, non-overlapping topics, facilitating efficient comprehension of video content and quick access to specific content. VTS is also critical to various downstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow features or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances of topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior performance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches. In this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring multimodal fusion and multimodal coherence modeling. Specifically, (1) we enhance multimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using cross-attention and mixture of experts. (2) To generally strengthen multimodality alignment and fusion, we pre-train and fine-tune the model with multimodal contrastive learning. (3) We propose a new pre-training task tailored for the VTS task, and a novel fine-tuning task for enhancing multimodal coherence modeling for VTS. We evaluate the proposed approaches on educational videos, in the form of lectures, due to the vital role of topic segmentation of educational videos in boosting learning experiences. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale Chinese lecture video dataset to augment the existing English corpus, promoting further research in VTS. Experiments on both English and Chinese lecture datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior VTS performance compared to competitive unsupervised and supervised baselines.

Title: Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models
Authors: Yulei Qin, Yuncheng Yang, Pengcheng Guo, Gang Li, Hang Shao, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Yun Gu, Ke Li, Xing Sun
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies. All related contents are available at this https URL.

Title: Comprehensive Overview of Reward Engineering and Shaping in Advancing Reinforcement Learning Applications
Authors: Sinan Ibrahim, Mostafa Mostafa, Ali Jnadi, Hadi Salloum, Pavel Osinenko
Abstract: The aim of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world applications is to create systems capable of making autonomous decisions by learning from their environment through trial and error. This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains.

Title: Real-time Speech Enhancement on Raw Signals with Deep State-space Modeling
Authors: Yan Ru Pei, Ritik Shrivastava, FNU Sidharth
Abstract: We present aTENNuate, a simple deep state-space autoencoder configured for efficient online raw speech enhancement in an end-to-end fashion. The network's performance is primarily evaluated on raw speech denoising, with additional assessments on tasks such as super-resolution and de-quantization. We benchmark aTENNuate on the VoiceBank + DEMAND and the Microsoft DNS1 synthetic test sets. The network outperforms previous real-time denoising models in terms of PESQ score, parameter count, MACs, and latency. Even as a raw waveform processing model, the model maintains high fidelity to the clean signal with minimal audible artifacts. In addition, the model remains performant even when the noisy input is compressed down to 4000Hz and 4 bits, suggesting general speech enhancement capabilities in low-resource environments.

Title: Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems
Authors: Jake Welde, Nishanth Rao, Pratik Kunapuli, Dinesh Jayaraman, Vijay Kumar
Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.

Title: Simultaneous Music Separation and Generation Using Multi-Track Latent Diffusion Models
Authors: Tornike Karchkhadze, Mohammad Rasool Izadi, Shlomo Dubnov
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in both music generation and music source separation tasks. Although in early stages, a trend is emerging towards integrating these tasks into a single framework, as both involve generating musically aligned parts and can be seen as facets of the same generative process. In this work, we introduce a latent diffusion-based multi-track generation model capable of both source separation and multi-track music synthesis by learning the joint probability distribution of tracks sharing a musical context. Our model also enables arrangement generation by creating any subset of tracks given the others. We trained our model on the Slakh2100 dataset, compared it with an existing simultaneous generation and separation model, and observed significant improvements across objective metrics for source separation, music, and arrangement generation tasks. Sound examples are available at this https URL.

Title: LoVA: Long-form Video-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Xin Cheng, Xihua Wang, Yihan Wu, Yuyue Wang, Ruihua Song
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation is important for video editing and post-processing, enabling the creation of semantics-aligned audio for silent video. However, most existing methods focus on generating short-form audio for short video segment (less than 10 seconds), while giving little attention to the scenario of long-form video inputs. For current UNet-based diffusion V2A models, an inevitable problem when handling long-form audio generation is the inconsistencies within the final concatenated audio. In this paper, we first highlight the importance of long-form V2A problem. Besides, we propose LoVA, a novel model for Long-form Video-to-Audio generation. Based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, LoVA proves to be more effective at generating long-form audio compared to existing autoregressive models and UNet-based diffusion models. Extensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that LoVA achieves comparable performance on 10-second V2A benchmark and outperforms all other baselines on a benchmark with long-form video input.

Title: A Modular-based Strategy for Mitigating Gradient Conflicts in Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Xiaoqian Liu, Yangfan Du, Jianjin Wang, Yuan Ge, Chen Xu, Tong Xiao, Guocheng Chen, Jingbo Zhu
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) involves generating target language text while continuously processing streaming speech input, presenting significant real-time challenges. Multi-task learning is often employed to enhance SimulST performance but introduces optimization conflicts between primary and auxiliary tasks, potentially compromising overall efficiency. The existing model-level conflict resolution methods are not well-suited for this task which exacerbates inefficiencies and leads to high GPU memory consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a Modular Gradient Conflict Mitigation (MGCM) strategy that detects conflicts at a finer-grained modular level and resolves them utilizing gradient projection. Experimental results demonstrate that MGCM significantly improves SimulST performance, particularly under medium and high latency conditions, achieving a 0.68 BLEU score gain in offline tasks. Additionally, MGCM reduces GPU memory consumption by over 95\% compared to other conflict mitigation methods, establishing it as a robust solution for SimulST tasks.

Title: Melody-Guided Music Generation
Authors: Shaopeng Wei, Manzhen Wei, Haoyu Wang, Yu Zhao, Gang Kou
Abstract: We present the Melody-Guided Music Generation (MG2) model, a novel approach using melody to guide the text-to-music generation that, despite a simple method and limited resources, achieves excellent performance. Specifically, we first align the text with audio waveforms and their associated melodies using the newly proposed Contrastive Language-Music Pretraining, enabling the learned text representation fused with implicit melody information. Subsequently, we condition the retrieval-augmented diffusion module on both text prompt and retrieved melody. This allows MG2 to generate music that reflects the content of the given text description, meantime keeping the intrinsic harmony under the guidance of explicit melody information. We conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets: MusicCaps and MusicBench. Surprisingly, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MG2 model surpasses current open-source text-to-music generation models, achieving this with fewer than 1/3 of the parameters or less than 1/200 of the training data compared to state-of-the-art counterparts. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive human evaluations involving three types of users and five perspectives, using newly designed questionnaires to explore the potential real-world applications of MG2.

Title: Learning Optimal Control and Dynamical Structure of Global Trajectory Search Problems with Diffusion Models
Authors: Jannik Graebner, Anjian Li, Amlan Sinha, Ryne Beeson
Abstract: Spacecraft trajectory design is a global search problem, where previous work has revealed specific solution structures that can be captured with data-driven methods. This paper explores two global search problems in the circular restricted three-body problem: hybrid cost function of minimum fuel/time-of-flight and transfers to energy-dependent invariant manifolds. These problems display a fundamental structure either in the optimal control profile or the use of dynamical structures. We build on our prior generative machine learning framework to apply diffusion models to learn the conditional probability distribution of the search problem and analyze the model's capability to capture these structures.

Title: Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and Autonomous Driving
Authors: Zijiang Yan, Hao Zhou, Hina Tabassum, Xue Liu
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.

Title: Tell What You Hear From What You See -- Video to Audio Generation Through Text
Authors: Xiulong Liu, Kun Su, Eli Shlizerman
Abstract: The content of visual and audio scenes is multi-faceted such that a video can be paired with various audio and vice-versa. Thereby, in video-to-audio generation task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for controlling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a well-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability. In this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a video and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional textual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i) Video-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which complements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest what audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT consists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for instructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the LLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens from visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel decoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural codec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio generation methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance when the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a prompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41). Furthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as preferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT enables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as suggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel applications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio captioning.

Abstract: We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory, and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.

Title: Fluid Antenna Index Modulation for MIMO Systems: Robust Transmission and Low-Complexity Detection
Authors: Xinghao Guo, Yin Xu, Dazhi He, Cixiao Zhang, Hanjiang Hong, Kai-Kit Wong, Wenjun Zhang, Yiyan Wu
Abstract: The fluid antenna (FA) index modulation (IM)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, referred to as FA-IM, significantly enhances spectral efficiency (SE) compared to the conventional FA-assisted MIMO system. To improve robustness against the high spatial correlation among multiple activated ports of the fluid antenna, this paper proposes an innovative FA grouping-based IM (FAG-IM) system. A block grouping scheme is employed based on the spatial correlation model and the distribution structure of the ports. Then, a closed-form expression for the average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound of the FAG-IM system is derived. To reduce the complexity of the receiver, the message passing architecture is incorporated into the FAG-IM system. Building on this, an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) detector, named structured AMP (S-AMP) detector, is proposed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the transmitted signals. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAG-IM system significantly outperforms the existing FA-IM system in the presence of spatial correlation, achieving more robust transmission. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed low-complexity S-AMP detector not only reduces time complexity to a linear scale but also substantially improves bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector, thereby enhancing the practical feasibility of the FAG-IM system.

Title: SoundLoc3D: Invisible 3D Sound Source Localization and Classification Using a Multimodal RGB-D Acoustic Camera
Authors: Yuhang He, Sangyun Shin, Anoop Cherian, Niki Trigoni, Andrew Markham
Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D sound sources and estimating their semantic labels -- where the sources may not be visible, but are assumed to lie on the physical surface of objects in the scene -- have many real applications, including detecting gas leak and machinery malfunction. The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.

Title: UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics
Authors: Kamal Shayegan
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.

Abstract: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at this https URL

Title: Improving Generalization for AI-Synthesized Voice Detection
Authors: Hainan Ren, Li Lin, Chun-Hao Liu, Xin Wang, Shu Hu
Abstract: AI-synthesized voice technology has the potential to create realistic human voices for beneficial applications, but it can also be misused for malicious purposes. While existing AI-synthesized voice detection models excel in intra-domain evaluation, they face challenges in generalizing across different domains, potentially becoming obsolete as new voice generators emerge. Current solutions use diverse data and advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., domain-invariant representation, self-supervised learning), but are limited by predefined vocoders and sensitivity to factors like background noise and speaker identity. In this work, we introduce an innovative disentanglement framework aimed at extracting domain-agnostic artifact features related to vocoders. Utilizing these features, we enhance model learning in a flat loss landscape, enabling escape from suboptimal solutions and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5.12% improvement in the equal error rate metric in intra-domain and 7.59% in cross-domain evaluations.

Authors: Alessandro Daniele Genuardi Oquendo, Agustín Matías Galante Cerviño, Nilotpal Kanti Sinha, Luc Andrea, Sam Mugel, Román Orús
Abstract: The growing complexity of radar signals demands responsive and accurate detection systems that can operate efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing models, while effective, often rely on substantial computational resources and large datasets, making them impractical for edge deployment. In this work, we propose an ultralight hybrid neural network optimized for edge applications, delivering robust performance across unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios (mean accuracy of 96.3% at 0 dB) using less than 100 samples per class, and significantly reducing computational overhead.
