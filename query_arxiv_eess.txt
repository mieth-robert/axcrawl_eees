Title: Diffusion-empowered AutoPrompt MedSAM
Authors: Peng Huang, Shu Hu, Bo Peng, Jiashu Zhang, Hongtu Zhu, Xi Wu, Xin Wang
Abstract: MedSAM, a medical foundation model derived from the SAM architecture, has demonstrated notable success across diverse medical domains. However, its clinical application faces two major challenges: the dependency on labor-intensive manual prompt generation, which imposes a significant burden on clinicians, and the absence of semantic labeling in the generated segmentation masks for organs or lesions, limiting its practicality for non-expert users. To address these limitations, we propose AutoMedSAM, an end-to-end framework derived from SAM, designed to enhance usability and segmentation performance. AutoMedSAM retains MedSAM's image encoder and mask decoder structure while introducing a novel diffusion-based class prompt encoder. The diffusion-based encoder employs a dual-decoder structure to collaboratively generate prompt embeddings guided by sparse and dense prompt definitions. These embeddings enhance the model's ability to understand and process clinical imagery autonomously. With this encoder, AutoMedSAM leverages class prompts to embed semantic information into the model's predictions, transforming MedSAM's semi-automated pipeline into a fully automated workflow. Furthermore, AutoMedSAM employs an uncertainty-aware joint optimization strategy during training to effectively inherit MedSAM's pre-trained knowledge while improving generalization by integrating multiple loss functions. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that AutoMedSAM achieves superior performance while broadening its applicability to both clinical settings and non-expert users.

Title: A Hybrid Model for Weakly-Supervised Speech Dereverberation
Authors: Louis Bahrman (S2A, IDS), Mathieu Fontaine (S2A, IDS), Gael Richard (S2A, IDS)
Abstract: This paper introduces a new training strategy to improve speech dereverberation systems using minimal acoustic information and reverberant (wet) speech. Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/wet data, which is difficult to obtain, or on target metrics that may not adequately capture reverberation characteristics and can lead to poor results on non-target metrics. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. The system's output is resynthesized using a generated room impulse response and compared with the original reverberant speech, providing a novel reverberation matching loss replacing the standard target metrics. During inference, only the trained dereverberation model is used. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across various objective metrics used in speech dereverberation than the state-of-the-art.

Title: A Comprehensive Review of U-Net and Its Variants: Advances and Applications in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Wang Jiangtao, Nur Intan Raihana Ruhaiyem, Fu Panpan
Abstract: Medical images often exhibit low and blurred contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues, with considerable variation in lesion edges and shapes even within the same disease, leading to significant challenges in segmentation. Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarize the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.

Title: Direct Estimation of Pediatric Heart Rate Variability from BOLD-fMRI: A Machine Learning Approach Using Dynamic Connectivity
Authors: Abdoljalil Addeh, Karen Ardila, Rebecca J Williams, G. Bruce Pike, M. Ethan MacDonald
Abstract: In many pediatric fMRI studies, cardiac signals are often missing or of poor quality. A tool to extract Heart Rate Variation (HRV) waveforms directly from fMRI data, without the need for peripheral recording devices, would be highly beneficial. We developed a machine learning framework to accurately reconstruct HRV for pediatric applications. A hybrid model combining one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) analyzed BOLD signals from 628 ROIs, integrating past and future data. The model achieved an 8% improvement in HRV accuracy, as evidenced by enhanced performance metrics. This approach eliminates the need for peripheral photoplethysmography devices, reduces costs, and simplifies procedures in pediatric fMRI. Additionally, it improves the robustness of pediatric fMRI studies, which are more sensitive to physiological and developmental variations than those in adults.

Title: Generalizable automated ischaemic stroke lesion segmentation with vision transformers
Authors: Chris Foulon, Robert Gray, James K. Ruffle, Jonathan Best, Tianbo Xu, Henry Watkins, Jane Rondina, Guilherme Pombo, Dominic Giles, Paul Wright, Marcela Ovando-Tellez, H. Rolf JÃ¤ger, Jorge Cardoso, Sebastien Ourselin, Geraint Rees, Parashkev Nachev
Abstract: Ischaemic stroke, a leading cause of death and disability, critically relies on neuroimaging for characterising the anatomical pattern of injury. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides the highest expressivity in ischemic stroke but poses substantial challenges for automated lesion segmentation: susceptibility artefacts, morphological heterogeneity, age-related comorbidities, time-dependent signal dynamics, instrumental variability, and limited labelled data. Current U-Net-based models therefore underperform, a problem accentuated by inadequate evaluation metrics that focus on mean performance, neglecting anatomical, subpopulation, and acquisition-dependent variability. Here, we present a high-performance DWI lesion segmentation tool addressing these challenges through optimized vision transformer-based architectures, integration of 3563 annotated lesions from multi-site data, and algorithmic enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art results. We further propose a novel evaluative framework assessing model fidelity, equity (across demographics and lesion subtypes), anatomical precision, and robustness to instrumental variability, promoting clinical and research utility. This work advances stroke imaging by reconciling model expressivity with domain-specific challenges and redefining performance benchmarks to prioritize equity and generalizability, critical for personalized medicine and mechanistic research.

Title: Electromagnetic Channel Statistics for Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Boqun Zhao, Xingqi Zhang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The channel statistics of a continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based channel are analyzed using its continuous electromagnetic (EM) properties. The received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is discussed under isotropic scattering conditions. Using Landau's theorem, the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation of the EM fading channel are shown to exhibit a step-like behavior. Building on this, closed-form expressions for the probability distribution of the SNR and the average channel capacity are derived. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of the derivations.

Title: Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images
Authors: Bo Wen, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, William Freeman, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An
Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a small amount of works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. And the finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a foundational universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but also we propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the- art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves cross-modality retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work to study retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.

Title: A view on learning robust goal-conditioned value functions: Interplay between RL and MPC
Authors: Nathan P. Lawrence, Philip D. Loewen, Michael G. Forbes, R. Bhushan Gopaluni, Ali Mesbah
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) offer a wealth of distinct approaches for automatic decision-making. Given the impact both fields have had independently across numerous domains, there is growing interest in combining the general-purpose learning capability of RL with the safety and robustness features of MPC. To this end, this paper presents a tutorial-style treatment of RL and MPC, treating them as alternative approaches to solving Markov decision processes. In our formulation, RL aims to learn a global value function through offline exploration in an uncertain environment, whereas MPC constructs a local value function through online optimization. This local-global perspective suggests new ways to design policies that combine robustness and goal-conditioned learning. Robustness is incorporated into the RL and MPC pipelines through a scenario-based approach. Goal-conditioned learning aims to alleviate the burden of engineering a reward function for RL. Combining the two leads to a single policy that unites a robust, high-level RL terminal value function with short-term, scenario-based MPC planning for reliable constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages the benefits of both RL and MPC, the effectiveness of which is demonstrated on classical control benchmarks.

Title: Conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding for medical image segmentation
Authors: Behzad Hejrati, Soumyanil Banerjee, Carri Glide-Hurst, Ming Dong
Abstract: Diffusion models have been used extensively for high quality image and video generation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: Bayesian Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems
Authors: Zongyao Zhao, Zhenyu Liu, Wei Dai, Xinke Tang, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Yuhan Dong
Abstract: The uncertainty of the sensing target brings great challenge to the beamforming design of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. To address this issue, we model the scattering coefficient and azimuth angle of the target as random variables and introduce a novel metric, expected detection probability (EPd), to quantify the average detection performance from a Bayesian perspective. Furthermore, we design a Bayesian beamforming scheme to optimize the expected detection probability under the limited power budget and communication performance constraints. A successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation-based (SCA-SDR) algorithm is developed for the complicated non-convex optimization problem corresponding to the beamforming scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other benchmarks and exhibits robust detection performance when parameters of the target are unknown and random.

Title: Active Inference through Incentive Design in Markov Decision Processes
Authors: Xinyi Wei, Chongyang Shi, Shuo Han, Ahmed H. Hemida, Charles A. Kamhoua, Jie Fu
Abstract: We present a method for active inference with partial observations in stochastic systems through incentive design, also known as the leader-follower game. Consider a leader agent who aims to infer a follower agent's type given a finite set of possible types. Different types of followers differ in either the dynamical model, the reward function, or both. We assume the leader can partially observe a follower's behavior in the stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the follower takes an optimal policy to maximize a total reward. To improve inference accuracy and efficiency, the leader can offer side payments (incentives) to the followers such that different types of them, under the incentive design, can exhibit diverging behaviors that facilitate the leader's inference task. We show the problem of active inference through incentive design can be formulated as a special class of leader-follower games, where the leader's objective is to balance the information gain and cost of incentive design. The information gain is measured by the entropy of the estimated follower's type given partial observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved by reducing a single-level optimization through softmax temporal consistency between followers' policies and value functions. This reduction allows us to develop an efficient gradient-based algorithm. We utilize observable operators in the hidden Markov model (HMM) to compute the necessary gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in stochastic grid world environments.

Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Thermal Dissipation in Lithium-Ion Battery Packs
Authors: Xuguang Zhang, Hexiang Zhang, Amjad Almansour, Mrityunjay Singh, Hengling Zhu, Michael C. Halbig, Yi Zheng
Abstract: Effective thermal management is critical for lithium-ion battery packs' safe and efficient operations, particularly in applications such as drones, where compact designs and varying airflow conditions present unique challenges. This study investigates the thermal performance of a 16-cell lithium-ion battery pack by optimizing cooling airflow configurations and integrating phase change materials (PCMs) for enhanced heat dissipation. Seven geometric configurations were evaluated under airflow speeds ranging from 0 to 15 m/s, reflecting the operational conditions of civilian drones. A comprehensive 3D simulation approach was used to analyze the effects of inlet and outlet configurations, airflow dynamics, and PCM phase transition behavior. Results indicate that the trapezoidal (wide-base) configuration, paired with a 5-inlet and 1-outlet setup, achieves the most balanced performance, effectively maintaining optimal operating temperatures across low and high-speed airflow conditions. PCM integration further stabilized thermal behavior, with phase change durations extending to 12.5 min under tested conditions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization and material integration in advancing compact and reliable thermal management systems for energy-dense battery packs. This study provides a foundation for designing efficient cooling strategies tailored to lightweight applications such as drones and portable energy storage systems.

Title: Real-time Optimization for Wind-to-H2 Driven Critical Infrastructures Based on Active Constraints Identification and Integer Variables Prediction
Authors: Mostafa Goodarzi, Qifeng Li
Abstract: This paper proposes a concept of wind-to-hydrogen-driven critical infrastructure (W2H-CI) as an engineering solution for decarbonizing the power generation sector where it utilizes wind power to produce hydrogen through electrolysis and combines it with the carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants. First, a convex mathematical model of W2H-CI is developed. Then, an optimization model for optimal operation of W2H-CI, which is a large-scale mixed-integer convex program (MICP), is proposed. Moreover, we propose to solve this problem in real-time in order to hedge against the uncertainty of wind power. For this purpose, a novel solution method based on active constraints identification and integer variable prediction is introduced. This method can solve MICP problems very fast since it uses historical optimization data to predict the values of binary variables and a limited number of constraints which most likely contain all active constraints. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed fast solution method using two W2H-CI case studies.

Title: Optimal Steady-State Secondary Control of MT-HVdc Grids with Reduced Communications
Authors: Babak Abdolmaleki, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a centralized secondary control for the real-time steady-state optimization of multi-terminal HVdc grids under voltage and current limits. First, we present the dynamic models of the grid components, including the modular multilevel converter (MMC) stations and their different control layers. We also derive the quasi-static input-output model of the system, which is suitable for the steady-state control design. Second, we formulate a general optimization problem using this quasi-static model and find the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of its solutions. Third, we propose a secondary control based on primal-dual dynamics to adjust the voltage setpoints of the dispatchable MMCs, with which the system asymptotically converges to a steady state that satisfies these optimality conditions. Fourth, we provide a communication triggering mechanism to reduce the communication traffic between the secondary control unit and the MMC stations. Finally, we verify our proposal for different case studies by adapting it to an offshore multi-terminal HVdc grid composed of heterogeneous MMC stations simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The problems of proportional current minimization and loss reduction are two special case studies.

Title: Smell of Source: Learning-Based Odor Source Localization with Molecular Communication
Authors: Ayse Sila Okcu, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Odor source localization is a fundamental challenge in molecular communication, environmental monitoring, disaster response, industrial safety, and robotics. In this study, we investigate three major approaches: Bayesian filtering, machine learning (ML) models, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the aim of odor source localization in a single-source, single-molecule case. By considering the source-sensor architecture as a transmitter-receiver model we explore source localization under the scope of molecular communication. Synthetic datasets are generated using a 2D advection-diffusion PDE solver to evaluate each method under varying conditions, including sensor noise and sparse measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that \textbf{Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)} achieve the lowest localization error of \(\mathbf{0.89 \times 10^{-6}}\) m, outperforming \textbf{machine learning (ML) inversion} (\(\mathbf{1.48 \times 10^{-6}}\) m) and \textbf{Kalman filtering} (\(\mathbf{1.62 \times 10^{-6}}\) m). The \textbf{reinforcement learning (RL)} approach, while achieving a localization error of \(\mathbf{3.01 \times 10^{-6}}\) m, offers an inference time of \(\mathbf{0.147}\) s, highlighting the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency among different methodologies.

Title: Choroidal image analysis for OCT image sequences with applications in systemic health
Authors: Jamie Burke
Abstract: The choroid, a highly vascular layer behind the retina, is an extension of the central nervous system and has parallels with the renal cortex, with blood flow far exceeding that of the brain and kidney. Thus, there has been growing interest of choroidal blood flow reflecting physiological status of systemic disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution imaging of the choroid, but conventional analysis methods remain manual or semi-automatic, limiting reproducibility, standardisation and clinical utility. In this thesis, I develop several new methods to analyse the choroid in OCT image sequences, with each successive method improving on its predecessors. I first develop two semi-automatic approaches for choroid region (Gaussian Process Edge Tracing, GPET) and vessel (Multi-scale Median Cut Quantisation, MMCQ) analysis, which improve on manual approaches but remain user-dependent. To address this, I introduce DeepGPET, a deep learning-based region segmentation method which improves on execution time, reproducibility, and end-user accessibility, but lacks choroid vessel analysis and automatic feature measurement. Improving on this, I developed Choroidalyzer, a deep learning-based pipeline to segment the choroidal space and vessels and generate fully automatic, clinically meaningful and reproducible choroidal features. I provide rigorous evaluation of these four approaches and consider their potential clinical value in three applications into systemic health: OCTANE, assessing choroidal changes in renal transplant recipients and donors; PREVENT, exploring choroidal associations with Alzheimer's risk factors at mid-life; D-RISCii, assessing choroidal variation and feasibility of OCT in critical care. In short, this thesis contributes many open-source tools for standardised choroidal measurement and highlights the choroid's potential as a biomarker in systemic health.

Title: Morphing Wing Designs in Commercial Aviation
Authors: Chengyue Dong, Mansur M. Arief
Abstract: With increasing demands for fuel efficiency and operational adaptability in commercial aviation}, this paper provides a systematic review and classification of morphing wing technologies, analyzing their aerodynamic performance characteristics and atmospheric condition adaptability. We first develop a comprehensive classification framework for morphing wing designs based on their scale of morphing, actuation mechanisms, and intended purposes. Through analysis of historical developments and current implementations, we evaluate two significant case studies: the Mission Adaptive Compliant Wing (MACW) and Adaptive Aspect Ratio (AdAR) morphing wing, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 25% in drag reduction and 40% in control authority. Our investigation reveals critical trade-offs between full-span and partial morphing approaches, particularly regarding implementation complexity, certification requirements, and operational reliability. The study concludes with an assessment of technical barriers and opportunities, providing specific recommendations for advancing morphing wing technology in commercial aviation applications. Key findings indicate that while material science and control system advances enable practical implementation, certification pathways and maintenance considerations remain critical challenges for widespread adoption.

Title: Color-Quality Invariance for Robust Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Ravi Shah, Atsushi Fukuda, Quan Huu Cap
Abstract: Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge, particularly for images with varying color distributions and qualities. Previous approaches often struggle when models trained on high-quality images fail to generalize to low-quality test images due to these color and quality shifts. In this work, we propose two novel techniques to enhance generalization: dynamic color image normalization (DCIN) module and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss. The DCIN dynamically normalizes the color of test images using two reference image selection strategies. Specifically, the DCIN utilizes a global reference image selection (GRIS), which finds a universal reference image, and a local reference image selection (LRIS), which selects a semantically similar reference image per test sample. Additionally, CQG loss enforces invariance to color and quality variations by ensuring consistent segmentation predictions across transformed image pairs. Experimental results show that our proposals significantly improve segmentation performance over the baseline on two target domain datasets, despite being trained solely on a single source domain. Notably, our model achieved up to a 32.3-point increase in Dice score compared to the baseline, consistently producing robust and usable results even under substantial domain shifts. Our work contributes to the development of more robust medical image segmentation models that generalize across unseen domains. The implementation code is available at this https URL.

Title: VINP: Variational Bayesian Inference with Neural Speech Prior for Joint ASR-Effective Speech Dereverberation and Blind RIR Identification
Authors: Pengyu Wang, Ying Fang, Xiaofei Li
Abstract: Reverberant speech, denoting the speech signal degraded by the process of reverberation, contains crucial knowledge of both anechoic source speech and room impulse response (RIR). This work proposes a variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework with neural speech prior (VINP) for joint speech dereverberation and blind RIR identification. In VINP, a probabilistic signal model is constructed in the time-frequency (T-F) domain based on convolution transfer function (CTF) approximation. For the first time, we propose using an arbitrary discriminative dereverberation deep neural network (DNN) to predict the prior distribution of anechoic speech within a probabilistic model. By integrating both reverberant speech and the anechoic speech prior, VINP yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations of the anechoic speech spectrum and CTF filter, respectively. After simple transformations, the waveforms of anechoic speech and RIR are estimated. Moreover, VINP is effective for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which sets it apart from most deep learning (DL)-based single-channel dereverberation approaches. Experiments on single-channel speech dereverberation demonstrate that VINP reaches an advanced level in most metrics related to human perception and displays unquestionable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in ASR-related metrics. For blind RIR identification, experiments indicate that VINP attains the SOTA level in blind estimation of reverberation time at 60 dB (RT60) and direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR). Codes and audio samples are available online.

Title: Towards Understanding of Frequency Dependence on Sound Event Detection
Authors: Hyeonuk Nam, Seong-Hu Kim, Deokki Min, Byeong-Yun Ko, Yong-Hwa Park
Abstract: In this work, various analysis methods are conducted on frequency-dependent methods on SED to further delve into their detailed characteristics and behaviors on SED. While SED has been rapidly advancing through the adoption of various deep learning techniques from other pattern recognition fields, these techniques are often not suitable for SED. To address this issue, two frequency-dependent SED methods were previously proposed: FilterAugment, a data augmentation randomly weighting frequency bands, and frequency dynamic convolution (FDY Conv), an architecture applying frequency adaptive convolution kernels. These methods have demonstrated superior performance in SED, and we aim to further analyze their detailed effectiveness and characteristics in SED. We compare class-wise performance to find out specific pros and cons of FilterAugment and FDY Conv. We apply Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights time-frequency region that is more inferred by the model, on SED models with and without frequency masking and two types of FilterAugment to observe their detailed characteristics. We propose simpler frequency dependent convolution methods and compare them with FDY Conv to further understand which components of FDY Conv affects SED performance. Lastly, we apply PCA to show how FDY Conv adapts dynamic kernel across frequency dimensions on different sound event classes. The results and discussions demonstrate that frequency dependency plays a significant role in sound event detection and further confirms the effectiveness of frequency dependent methods on SED.

Title: Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation
Authors: Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You
Abstract: The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.

Title: Physics-Informed Recurrent Network for Gas Pipeline Network Parameters Identification
Authors: Siyuan Wang, Wenchuan Wu, Chenhui Lin, Qi Wang, Shuwei Xu, Binbin Chen
Abstract: As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can provide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal dispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal operation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of accurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the mathematical models of such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network (PIRN) model to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. The approach combines data-driven learning from measurement data with the fluid dynamics described by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical state-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification is transformed into a training process for a PIRN. Similar to standard recurrent neural networks, this model can be implemented using the PyTorch framework and trained via backpropagation. Case studies demonstrate that our method accurately estimates gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node measurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter efficiency. Furthermore, the identified models can be seamlessly integrated into optimization frameworks.

Title: Adaptive Sampling and Joint Semantic-Channel Coding under Dynamic Channel Environment
Authors: Zhiyuan Qi, Yulong Feng, Zhijin Qin
Abstract: Deep learning enabled semantic communications are attracting extensive attention. However, most works normally ignore the data acquisition process and suffer from robustness issues under dynamic channel environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive joint sampling-semantic-channel coding (Adaptive-JSSCC) framework. Specifically, we propose a semantic-aware sampling and reconstruction method to optimize the number of samples dynamically for each region of the images. According to semantic significance, we optimize sampling matrices for each region of the most individually and obtain a semantic sampling ratio distribution map shared with the receiver. Through the guidance of the map, high-quality reconstruction is achieved. Meanwhile, attention-based channel adaptive module (ACAM) is designed to overcome the neural network model mismatch between the training and testing channel environment during sampling-reconstruction and encoding-decoding. To this end, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is employed as an extra parameter input to integrate and reorganize intermediate characteristics. Simulation results show that the proposed Adaptive-JSSCC effectively reduces the amount of data acquisition without degrading the reconstruction performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art, and it is highly adaptable and adjustable to dynamic channel environments.

Title: Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Active Contact Selection in Deep Brain Stimulation
Authors: Anna Franziska Frigge, Alexander Medvedev
Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming remains a complex and time-consuming process, requiring manual selection of stimulation parameters to achieve therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse side-effects. This study explores mathematical optimization for DBS programming, using functional subdivisions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to define the desired activation profile. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework is presented allowing for dissimilar current distribution across active contacts. MILP is compared to a Linear Programming (LP) approach in terms of computational efficiency and activation accuracy. Results from ten Parkinson's disease patients treated with DBS show that while MILP better matches the predefined stimulation target activation profile, LP solutions more closely resemble clinically applied settings, suggesting the profile may not fully capture clinically relevant patterns. Additionally, MILP's limitations are discussed, including its reliance on precisely defined target regions and its computational burden for larger target sets.

Title: Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Over-The-Air Control of UAV Swarm Dynamics
Authors: Zhuangkun Wei, Wenxiu Hu, Yathreb Bouazizi, Mengbang Zou, Chenguang Liu, Yunfei Chen, Hongjian Sun, Julie McCann
Abstract: Coordinated controlling a large UAV swarm requires significant spectrum resources due to the need for bandwidth allocation per UAV, posing a challenge in resource-limited environments. Over-the-air (OTA) control has emerged as a spectrum-efficient approach, leveraging electromagnetic superposition to form control signals at a base station (BS). However, existing OTA controllers lack sufficient optimization variables to meet UAV swarm control objectives and fail to integrate control with other BS functions like sensing. This work proposes an integrated sensing and OTA control framework (ISAC-OTA) for UAV swarm. The BS performs OTA signal construction (uplink) and dispatch (downlink) while simultaneously sensing objects. Two uplink post-processing methods are developed: a control-centric approach generating closed-form control signals via a feedback-looped OTA control problem, and a sensing-centric method mitigating transmission-induced interference for accurate object sensing. For the downlink, a non-convex problem is formulated and solved to minimize control signal dispatch (transmission) error while maintaining a minimum sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show that the proposed ISAC-OTA controller achieves control performance comparable to the benchmark optimal control algorithm while maintaining high sensing accuracy, despite OTA transmission interference. Moreover, it eliminates the need for per-UAV bandwidth allocation, showcasing a spectrum-efficient method for cooperative control in future wireless systems.

Title: On Event-Triggered Resilient Consensus Using Auxiliary Layer
Authors: Pushkal Purohit, Anoop Jain
Abstract: Due to its design simplicity, auxiliary layer-based resilient control is widely discussed in the literature to mitigate the effects of False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. However, the increased communication burden due to additional communication links for connecting an extra layer is often overlooked in the literature. This paper bridges this gap by considering an event-triggered approach for inter-layer communication between the physical layer (containing actual agents) and the auxiliary layer (containing virtual agents) for the resilient state consensus in a multi-agent system. We provide state-based and dynamic event-triggering mechanisms, the former being the motivation for the latter. The exclusion of Zeno behavior is established by proving positive minimum inter-event time (MIET). Extensive simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.

Title: Towards THz-based Obstacle Sensing: A Generative Radio Environment Awareness Framework
Authors: Tianyu Hu, Yunhang Xie, Shuai Wang, Boyu Ning, Lingxiang Li, Zhi Chen
Abstract: Obstacle sensing is essential for terahertz (THz) communication since the subsequent beam management can avoid THz signals blocked by the obstacles. In parallel, radio environment, which can be manifested by channel knowledge such as the distribution of received signal strength (RSS), reveals signal propagation situation and the corresponding obstacle information. However, the awareness of the radio environment for obstacle sensing is challenging in practice, as the sparsely deployed THz sensors can acquire only little a priori knowledge with their RSS measurements. Therefore, we formulate in this paper a radio environment awareness problem, which for the first time considers a probability distribution of obstacle attributes. To solve such a problem, we propose a THz-based generative radio environment awareness framework, in which obstacle information is obtained directly from the aware radio environment. We also propose a novel generative model based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), where U-net and the objective function of the problem are introduced to enable accurate awareness of RSS distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can improve the awareness of the radio environment, and thus achieve superior sensing performance in terms of average precision regarding obstacles' shape and location.

Title: The Devil is in the Prompts: De-Identification Traces Enhance Memorization Risks in Synthetic Chest X-Ray Generation
Authors: Raman Dutt
Abstract: Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study adopts a data-driven approach and presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals an unexpected finding: prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures are among the most memorized, with de-identification markers contributing the most. Furthermore, we also find existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens highlighting a broader issue in T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. On this front, we propose actionable strategies to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Title: Non-Interchangeability between Heart Rate Variability and Pulse Rate Variability During Supine-to-Stand Tests
Authors: Runwei Lin, Frank Halfwerk, Gozewijn Dirk Laverman, Dirk Donker, Ying Wang
Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely recognized as a valuable biomarker for assessing autonomic cardiac regulation. Pulse rate variability (PRV) is a common surrogate of HRV given the wide usability of PPG in commercially available devices. However, there is no clear conclusion on whether PRV can replace HRV given their different physiological mechanisms. This study evaluates the interchangeability of young adults HRV and PRV during supine-to-stand (STS) tests which are known as common posture transitions in daily life monitoring. Fifteen features from time, frequency and nonlinear domains were extracted from both electrocardiography and PPG signals. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests examined the difference between the extracted HRV and PRV features during supine, transition and standing phases separately. One feature showed significant difference in the supine phase, and this discrepancy increased to four in the transition and standing phases. These findings suggested that PRV is different from HRV in the STS tests, despite the fact that both metrics can reflect the sympathetic activation triggered by the posture changes.

Title: Towards Efficient and Multifaceted Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training Leveraging Hierarchical Selective State Space Model and Decoupled Cross-entropy Loss
Authors: Fu-An Chao, Berlin Chen
Abstract: Prior efforts in building computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems often treat automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as separate fronts: the former aims to provide multiple pronunciation aspect scores across diverse linguistic levels, while the latter focuses instead on pinpointing the precise phonetic pronunciation errors made by non-native language learners. However, it is generally expected that a full-fledged CAPT system should perform both functionalities simultaneously and efficiently. In response to this surging demand, we in this work first propose HMamba, a novel CAPT approach that seamlessly integrates APA and MDD tasks in parallel. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, decoupled cross-entropy loss (deXent), specifically tailored for MDD to facilitate better-supervised learning for detecting mispronounced phones, thereby enhancing overall performance. A comprehensive set of empirical results on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on APA. Notably, our proposed approach also yields a considerable improvement in MDD performance over a strong baseline, achieving an F1-score of 63.85%. Our codes are made available at this https URL

Authors: Thomas Johnson, Kieran Woodward
Abstract: Low-cost miniaturised sensors offer significant advantage to monitor the environment in real-time and accurately. The area of air quality monitoring has attracted much attention in recent years because of the increasing impacts on the environment and more personally to human health and mental wellbeing. Rapid growth in sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is paving the way for low-cost systems to transform global monitoring of air quality. Drawing on 4 years of development work, in this paper we outline the design, implementation and analysis of \textit{Enviro-IoT} as a step forward to monitoring air quality levels within urban environments by means of a low-cost sensing system. An in-the-wild study for 9-months was performed to evaluate the Enviro-IoT system against industry standard equipment is performed with accuracy for measuring Particulate Matter 2.5, 10 and Nitrogen Dioxide achieving 98\%, 97\% and 97\% respectively. The results in this case study are made up Of 57, 120 which highlight that it is possible to take advantage of low-cost sensors coupled with IoT technologies to validate the Enviro-IoT device against research-grade industrial instruments.

Title: RenderBox: Expressive Performance Rendering with Text Control
Authors: Huan Zhang, Akira Maezawa, Simon Dixon
Abstract: Expressive music performance rendering involves interpreting symbolic scores with variations in timing, dynamics, articulation, and instrument-specific techniques, resulting in performances that capture musical can emotional intent. We introduce RenderBox, a unified framework for text-and-score controlled audio performance generation across multiple instruments, applying coarse-level controls through natural language descriptions and granular-level controls using music scores. Based on a diffusion transformer architecture and cross-attention joint conditioning, we propose a curriculum-based paradigm that trains from plain synthesis to expressive performance, gradually incorporating controllable factors such as speed, mistakes, and style diversity. RenderBox achieves high performance compared to baseline models across key metrics such as FAD and CLAP, and also tempo and pitch accuracy under different prompting tasks. Subjective evaluation further demonstrates that RenderBox is able to generate controllable expressive performances that sound natural and musically engaging, aligning well with prompts and intent.

Title: EIQP: Execution-time-certified and Infeasibility-detecting QP Solver
Authors: Liang Wu, Wei Xiao, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: Solving real-time quadratic programming (QP) is a ubiquitous task in control engineering, such as in model predictive control and control barrier function-based QP. In such real-time scenarios, certifying that the employed QP algorithm can either return a solution within a predefined level of optimality or detect QP infeasibility before the predefined sampling time is a pressing requirement. This article considers convex QP and adopts its homogeneous formulation to achieve infeasibility detection. Exploiting this homogeneous formulation, this article proposes a novel infeasible interior-point method (IPM) algorithm with the best theoretical $O(\sqrt{n})$ iteration complexity that feasible IPM algorithms enjoy. The iteration complexity is proved to be \textit{exact} (rather than an upper bound), \textit{simple to calculate}, and \textit{data independent}, with the value $\left\lceil\frac{\log(\frac{n+1}{\epsilon})}{-\log(1-\frac{0.414213}{\sqrt{n+1}})}\right\rceil$ (where $n$ and $\epsilon$ denote the number of constraints and the predefined optimality level, respectively), making it appealing to certify the execution time of online time-varying convex QPs. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement without requiring a line search procedure (uses the full Newton step), and its C-code implementation (offering MATLAB, Julia, and Python interfaces) and numerical examples are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Axial current as the origin of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum
Authors: Orkash Amat, Nurimangul Nurmamat, Yong-Feng Huang, Cheng-Ming Li, Jin-Jun Geng, Chen-Ran Hu, Ze-Cheng Zou, Xiao-Fei Dong, Chen Deng, Fan Xu, Xiao-li Zhang, Chen Du
Abstract: We show that it is impossible to experimentally observe the quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) effect without its axial current. Broadly speaking, we argue that the spiral or interference characteristics of the axial current density determine the occurrence of nonlinear or tunneling effects in any spacetimedependent quantum systems. Our findings offer a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the limitations of Keldysh theory and provides new insights into the angular momentum properties of quantum systems, particularly in tunneling-dominated regimes. Using Wigner function methods, fermionic generalized two-level model, and Berry phase simulations, we predict that IOAM effect can persist even in pure quantum tunneling processes. These results open the door for experimental verification of IOAM effects in future high-intensity QED experiments, such as those using X-ray free electron lasers.

Title: Hyper Compressed Fine-Tuning of Large Foundation Models with Quantum Inspired Adapters
Authors: Snehal Raj, Brian Coyle
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large foundation models for specific tasks has become increasingly challenging due to the computational and storage demands associated with full parameter updates. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.

Title: Downlink and Uplink ISAC in Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems
Authors: Boqun Zhao, Chongjun Ouyang, Xingqi Zhang, Hyundong Shin, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. Within this framework, continuous operator-based signal models are employed to describe the sensing and communication processes. The performance of communication and sensing is analyzed using two information-theoretic metrics: the communication rate (CR) and the sensing rate (SR). 1) For downlink ISAC, three continuous beamforming designs are proposed: i) the communications-centric (C-C) design that maximizes the CR, ii) the sensing-centric (S-C) design that maximizes the SR, and iii) the Pareto-optimal design that characterizes the Pareto boundary of the CR-SR region. A signal subspace-based approach is proposed to derive the closed-form optimal beamformers for the considered designs. On this basis, closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable CRs and SRs, and the downlink rate region achieved by CAPAs is characterized. 2) For uplink ISAC, the C-C and S-C successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based methods are proposed to manage inter-functionality interference. Using the subspace approach along with the time-sharing technique, closed-form expressions for the optimal beamformers are derived, and the achievable CRs, SRs, and rate region are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that, for both downlink and uplink, CAPA-based ISAC achieves higher CRs and SRs as well as larger CR-SR regions compared to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-based ISAC.

Title: Adaptive Central Frequencies Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech
Authors: Soufiyan Bahadi, Eric Plourde, Jean Rouat
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by nervous systems, revolutionizes information processing with its focus on efficiency and low power consumption. Using sparse coding, this paradigm enhances processing efficiency, which is crucial for edge devices with power constraints. The Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), adapted for audio with Gammatone and Gammachirp filter banks, provides an efficient sparse coding method for neuromorphic speech processing. Adaptive LCA (ALCA) further refines this method by dynamically adjusting modulation parameters, thereby improving reconstruction quality and sparsity. This paper introduces an enhanced ALCA version, the ALCA Central Frequency (ALCA-CF), which dynamically adapts both modulation parameters and central frequencies, optimizing the speech representation. Evaluations show that this approach improves reconstruction quality and sparsity while significantly reducing the power consumption of speech classification, without compromising classification accuracy, particularly on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip.

Title: Leveraging Allophony in Self-Supervised Speech Models for Atypical Pronunciation Assessment
Authors: Kwanghee Choi, Eunjung Yeo, Kalvin Chang, Shinji Watanabe, David Mortensen
Abstract: Allophony refers to the variation in the phonetic realization of a phoneme based on its phonetic environment. Modeling allophones is crucial for atypical pronunciation assessment, which involves distinguishing atypical from typical pronunciations. However, recent phoneme classifier-based approaches often simplify this by treating various realizations as a single phoneme, bypassing the complexity of modeling allophonic variation. Motivated by the acoustic modeling capabilities of frozen self-supervised speech model (S3M) features, we propose MixGoP, a novel approach that leverages Gaussian mixture models to model phoneme distributions with multiple subclusters. Our experiments show that MixGoP achieves state-of-the-art performance across four out of five datasets, including dysarthric and non-native speech. Our analysis further suggests that S3M features capture allophonic variation more effectively than MFCCs and Mel spectrograms, highlighting the benefits of integrating MixGoP with S3M features.

Title: Fingerprint Matrix Concept for Detecting, Localizing and Characterizing Targets in Complex Media
Authors: Arthur Le Ber, Antton GoÃ¯coechea, Lukas M. Rachbauer, William Lambert, Xiaoping Jia, Mathias Fink, Arnaud Tourin, Stefan Rotter, Alexandre Aubry
Abstract: As waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes a full blurring of the image beyond a transport mean free path. Here, we show how to detect, localize, and characterize any scattering target through the reflection matrix of the complex medium in which this target is embedded and thus hidden from direct view. More precisely, we introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. Applied to the recorded reflection matrix, this operator provides a likelihood index of the target in any given state, despite the scattering fog induced by the surrounding environment. This state can be the target position for localization purposes, its shape for characterization, or any other parameter that influences the target response. Our concept is versatile and broadly applicable to different type of waves for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured. We demonstrate this here explicitly by performing different proof-of-concept experiments with ultrasound on targets buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension, on lesion markers for clinical applications, and on the architecture of muscle tissue.

Title: On the use of neural networks for the structural characterization of polymeric porous materials
Authors: Jorge Torre, Suset Barroso-Solares, M.A. RodrÃ­guez-PÃ©rez, Javier Pinto
Abstract: The structural characterization is an essential task in the study of porous materials. To achieve reliable results, it requires to evaluate images with hundreds of pores. Current methods require large time amounts and are subjected to human errors and subjectivity. A completely automatic tool would not only speed up the process but also enhance its reliability and reproducibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is the study of a deep-learning-based technique for the structural characterization of porous materials, through the use of a convolutional neural network. Several fine-tuned Mask R CNN models are evaluated using different training configurations in four separate datasets each composed of numerous SEM images of diverse polymeric porous materials: closed-pore extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane (PU), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and open-pore PU. Results prove the tool capable of providing very accurate results, equivalent to those achieved by time consuming manual methods, in a matter of seconds.

Title: A Safe Hybrid Control Framework for Car-like Robot with Guaranteed Global Path-Invariance using a Control Barrier Function
Authors: Nan Wang, Adeel Akhtar, Ricardo G. Sanfelice
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid framework for car-like robots with obstacle avoidance, global convergence, and safety, where safety is interpreted as path invariance, namely, once the robot converges to the path, it never leaves the path. Given a priori obstacle-free feasible path where obstacles can be around the path, the task is to avoid obstacles while reaching the path and then staying on the path without leaving it. The problem is solved in two stages. Firstly, we define a ``tight'' obstacle-free neighborhood along the path and design a local controller to ensure convergence to the path and path invariance. The control barrier function technology is involved in the control design to steer the system away from its singularity points, where the local path invariant controller is not defined. Secondly, we design a hybrid control framework that integrates this local path-invariant controller with any global tracking controller from the existing literature without path invariance guarantee, ensuring convergence from any position to the desired path, namely, global convergence. This framework guarantees path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Detailed simulation results affirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Title: An Unconventional Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Receiving Nano-Antenna Activated by ac Spin Pumping and the ac Inverse Spin Hall Effect
Authors: Raisa Fabiha, Michael Suche, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.

Title: Beamfocusing Capabilities of a Uniform Linear Array in the Holographic Regime
Authors: Xavier Mestre, Adrian Agustin
Abstract: The use of multiantenna technologies in the near field offers the possibility of focusing the energy in spatial regions rather than just in angle. The objective of this paper is to provide a formal framework that allows to establish the region in space where this effect can take place and how efficient this focusing can be, assuming that the transmit architecture is a uniform linear array (ULA). A dyadic Green's channel model is adopted, and the amplitude differences between the receiver and each transmit antenna are effectively incorporated in the model. By considering a second-order expansion of the SNR around the intended receiver, a formal criterion is derived in order to establish whether beamfocusing is feasible or not. An analytic description is provided that determines the shape and position of the asymptotic ellipsoid where a minimum SNR is achieved. Further insights are provided by considering the holographic regime, whereby the number of elements of the ULA increase without bound while the distance between adjacent elements converges to zero. This asymptotic framework allows to simplify the analytical form of the beamfocusing feasibility region, which in turn provides some further insights into the shape of the coverage regions depending on the position of the intended receiver. In particular, it is shown that beamfocusing is only possible if the size of the ULA is at least $4.4\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the transmission wavelength. Furthermore, a closed form analytical expression is provided that asymptotically determines the maximum distance where beamfocusing is feasible as a function of the elevation angle. In particular, beamfocusing is only feasible when the receiver is located between a minimum and a maximum distance from the array, where these upper and lower distance limits effectively depend on the angle of elevation

Title: Advanced Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech for Background Removal and Preservation with Controllable Masked Speech Prediction
Authors: Leying Zhang, Wangyou Zhang, Zhengyang Chen, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: The acoustic background plays a crucial role in natural conversation. It provides context and helps listeners understand the environment, but a strong background makes it difficult for listeners to understand spoken words. The appropriate handling of these backgrounds is situation-dependent: Although it may be necessary to remove background to ensure speech clarity, preserving the background is sometimes crucial to maintaining the contextual integrity of the speech. Despite recent advancements in zero-shot Text-to-Speech technologies, current systems often struggle with speech prompts containing backgrounds. To address these challenges, we propose a Controllable Masked Speech Prediction strategy coupled with a dual-speaker encoder, utilizing a task-related control signal to guide the prediction of dual background removal and preservation targets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables precise control over the removal or preservation of background across various acoustic conditions and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in unseen scenarios.

Title: Dual Arm Steering of Deformable Linear Objects in 2-D and 3-D Environments Using Euler's Elastica Solutions
Authors: Aharon Levin, Itay Grinberg, Elon Rimon, Amir Shapiro
Abstract: This paper describes a method for steering deformable linear objects using two robot hands in environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The approach involves manipulating an elastic inextensible rod by varying the gripping endpoint positions and tangents. Closed form solutions that describe the flexible linear object shape in planar environments, Euler's elastica, are described. The paper uses these solutions to formulate criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance. These criteria are formulated as constraints in the flexible object six-dimensional configuration space that represents the robot gripping endpoint positions and tangents. In particular, this paper introduces a novel criterion that ensures the flexible object stability during steering. All safety criteria are integrated into a scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments, which is lifted into a steering scheme in three-dimensional environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. Experiments with a dual-arm robot demonstrate the method.

Title: LoRP-TTS: Low-Rank Personalized Text-To-Speech
Authors: Åukasz Bondaruk, Jakub Kubiak
Abstract: Speech synthesis models convert written text into natural-sounding audio. While earlier models were limited to a single speaker, recent advancements have led to the development of zero-shot systems that generate realistic speech from a wide range of speakers using their voices as additional prompts. However, they still struggle with imitating non-studio-quality samples that differ significantly from the training datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) allows us to successfully use even single recordings of spontaneous speech in noisy environments as prompts. This approach enhances speaker similarity by up to $30pp$ while preserving content and naturalness. It represents a significant step toward creating truly diverse speech corpora, that is crucial in all speech-related tasks.

Title: Global linearization without hyperbolicity
Authors: Matthew D. Kvalheim, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$ diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth PoincarÃ© conjecture.

Title: Automatic Robot Task Planning by Integrating Large Language Model with Genetic Programming
Authors: Azizjon Kobilov, Jianglin Lan
Abstract: Accurate task planning is critical for controlling autonomous systems, such as robots, drones, and self-driving vehicles. Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.

Authors: Pascal HÃ¤big, Daniel Dittler, Maximilian Fey, Timo MÃ¼ller, Nikola MÃ¶Ãner, Nasser Jazdi, Michael Weyrich, Kai Hufendiek
Abstract: Power-to-X (PtX) products constitute a promising solution component in the defossilisation of hard-to-abate sectors. Where direct electrification is not possible, they can find application as chemical feedstock, easy to transport energy carriers and storage. In this contribution, a modular system architecture for a highly automated operation of an offshore off-grid PtX production platform consisting of five layers (asset, control, communication, digital, application) is presented. The assumed advantage of such an off-grid platform is the good scalability worldwide as well as easy exploitation of renewable potentials in any location. Using the example of a power-to-methanol process, a simplified prototype is outlined.

Title: Volumetric medical image segmentation through dual self-distillation in U-shaped networks
Authors: Soumyanil Banerjee, Nicholas Summerfield, Ming Dong, Carri Glide-Hurst
Abstract: U-shaped networks and its variants have demonstrated exceptional results for medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel dual self-distillation (DSD) framework in U-shaped networks for volumetric medical image segmentation. DSD distills knowledge from the ground-truth segmentation labels to the decoder layers. Additionally, DSD also distills knowledge from the deepest decoder and encoder layer to the shallower decoder and encoder layers respectively of a single U-shaped network. DSD is a generalized training strategy that could be attached to the backbone architecture of any U-shaped network to further improve its segmentation performance. We attached DSD on several state-of-the-art U-shaped backbones, and extensive experiments on various public 3D medical image segmentation datasets (cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus) demonstrated significant improvement over the same backbones without DSD. On average, after attaching DSD to the U-shaped backbones, we observed an increase of 2.82\%, 4.53\% and 1.3\% in Dice similarity score, a decrease of 7.15 mm, 6.48 mm and 0.76 mm in the Hausdorff distance, for cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus segmentation, respectively. These improvements were achieved with negligible increase in the number of trainable parameters and training time. Our proposed DSD framework also led to significant qualitative improvements for cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus segmentation over the U-shaped backbones.

Title: Detection of presence and number of persons by a Wi-Fi signal: a practical RSSI-based approach
Authors: Dario JukiÄ, Silvije Domazet, Ante Ivanko, David Raca, SiniÅ¡a NikoliÄ, Marin KneÅ¾eviÄ, Filip JoviÄ, Nenad Raca, Hrvoje Buljan
Abstract: We present experimental results and theoretical methods for the precise determination of the presence and the number of persons in an observed area by using Wi-Fi signals. Our setup does not require active cooperation of persons present in the Wi-Fi field, and relies only on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which is read by the detectors. We first show that the standard deviation of the measured RSSI data can be used as a practical tool to establish the presence of a person (or more persons) with high precision, in particular when the signal source is inside the measurement room. For the more difficult problem of counting the number of persons, we have employed machine learning algorithms to analyze data collected on nine different detectors and up to nine people present in our experiment. We have achieved excellent results (prediction accuracy of $98 \%$ and above) for counting already with only few detectors utilized in the analysis. While generalizations to nontrivial indoor geometries (such as odd shapes, more rooms, and greater size) may be of interest in some applications, where additional care with respect to positioning od detectors can be needed (or even placing additional detectors), this approach may be useful due to its conceptual practicality and solid prediction results.

Title: LEO Satellite and RIS: Two Keys to Seamless Indoor and Outdoor Localization
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Xing Liu, Jiguang He, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: The contemporary landscape of wireless technology underscores the critical role of precise localization services. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based solutions, however, fall short when it comes to indoor environments, and existing indoor localization techniques such as electromagnetic fingerprinting methods face challenges of additional implementation costs and limited coverage. This article explores an innovative solution that blends low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), unlocking its potential for realizing seamless indoor and outdoor localization (SIOL) with global coverage. After a comprehensive review of the distinctive characteristics of LEO satellites and RISs, we showcase their potential for SIOL applications through two case studies on position error bound evaluation. Finally, we discuss system architectures and highlight open challenges in such systems.

Abstract: In this retrospective study, we annotated 44 structures on two datasets: an internal dataset of 1,518 MRI sequences from 843 patients at the Mount Sinai Health System, and an external dataset of 397 MRI sequences from 263 patients for benchmarking. The internal dataset trained the nnU-Net model MRAnnotator, which demonstrated strong generalizability on the external dataset. MRAnnotator outperformed existing models such as TotalSegmentator MRI and MRSegmentator on both datasets, achieving an overall average Dice score of 0.878 on the internal dataset and 0.875 on the external set. Model weights are available on GitHub, and the external test set can be shared upon request.

Title: Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey
Authors: Chenyu Liu, Xinliang Zhou, Yihao Wu, Ruizhi Yang, Zhongruo Wang, Liming Zhai, Ziyu Jia, Yang Liu
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.

Title: Data Assimilation with Machine Learning Surrogate Models: A Case Study with FourCastNet
Authors: Melissa Adrian, Daniel Sanz-Alonso, Rebecca Willett
Abstract: Modern data-driven surrogate models for weather forecasting provide accurate short-term predictions but inaccurate and nonphysical long-term forecasts. This paper investigates online weather prediction using machine learning surrogates supplemented with partial and noisy observations. We empirically demonstrate and theoretically justify that, despite the long-time instability of the surrogates and the sparsity of the observations, filtering estimates can remain accurate in the long-time horizon. As a case study, we integrate FourCastNet, a weather surrogate model, within a variational data assimilation framework using partial, noisy ERA5 data. Our results show that filtering estimates remain accurate over a year-long assimilation window and provide effective initial conditions for forecasting tasks, including extreme event prediction.

Authors: Valdemar Tang, Claudio Gomes, Daniel Lucani
Abstract: We introduce a novel event-trigger threshold (ETT) regulation mechanism based on the quantitative semantics of propositional logic (PL). We exploit the expressiveness of the PL vocabulary to deliver a precise and flexible specification of ETT regulation based on system requirements and properties. Additionally, we present a modified ETT regulation mechanism that provides formal guarantees for satisfaction/violation detection of arbitrary PL properties. To validate our proposed method, we consider a convoy of vehicles in an adaptive cruise control scenario. In this scenario, the PL operators are used to encode safety properties and the ETTs are regulated accordingly, e.g., if our safety metric is high there can be a higher ETT threshold, while a smaller threshold is used when the system is approaching unsafe conditions. Under ideal ETT regulation conditions in this safety scenario, we show that reductions between 41.8 - 96.3% in the number of triggered events is possible compared to using a constant ETT while maintaining similar safety conditions.

Title: Physics-augmented Deep Learning with Adversarial Domain Adaptation: Applications to STM Image Denoising
Authors: Jianxin Xie, Wonhee Ko, Rui-Xing Zhang, Bing Yao
Abstract: Image denoising is a critical task in various scientific fields such as medical imaging and material characterization, where the accurate recovery of underlying structures from noisy data is essential. Although supervised denoising techniques have achieved significant advancements, they typically require large datasets of paired clean-noisy images for training. Unsupervised methods, while not reliant on paired data, typically necessitate a set of unpaired clean images for training, which are not always accessible. In this paper, we propose a physics-augmented deep learning with adversarial domain adaption (PDA-Net) framework for unsupervised image denoising, with applications to denoise real-world scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. Our PDA-Net leverages the underlying physics to simulate and envision the ground truth for denoised STM images. Additionally, built upon Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we incorporate a cycle-consistency module and a domain adversarial module into our PDA-Net to address the challenge of lacking paired training data and achieve information transfer between the simulated and real experimental domains. Finally, we propose to implement feature alignment and weight-sharing techniques to fully exploit the similarity between simulated and real experimental images, thereby enhancing the denoising performance in both the simulation and experimental domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PDA-Net successfully enhances the quality of STM images, offering promising applications to enhance scientific discovery and accelerate experimental quantum material research.

Title: MT2KD: Towards A General-Purpose Encoder for Speech, Speaker, and Audio Events
Authors: Xiaoyu Yang, Qiujia Li, Chao Zhang, Phil Woodland
Abstract: With the advances in deep learning, the performance of end-to-end (E2E) single-task models for speech and audio processing has been constantly improving. However, it is still challenging to build a general-purpose model with high performance on multiple tasks, since different speech and audio processing tasks usually require different training data, input features, or model architectures to achieve optimal performance. In this work, MT2KD, a novel two-stage multi-task learning framework is proposed to build a general-purpose speech and audio encoder that jointly performs three fundamental tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio tagging (AT) and speaker verification (SV). In the first stage, multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) is applied to align the feature spaces of three single-task high-performance teacher encoders into a single student encoder using the same unlabelled data. In the second stage, multi-task supervised fine-tuning is carried out by initialising the model from the first stage and training on the separate labelled data of each single task. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task training pipeline significantly outperforms a baseline model trained with multi-task learning from scratch. The final system achieves good performance on ASR, AT and SV: with less than 4% relative word-error-rate increase on ASR, only 1.9 lower mean averaged precision on AT and 0.23% absolute higher equal error rate on SV compared to the best-performing single-task encoders, using only a 66M total model parameters.

Title: Digital and Hybrid Precoding Designs in Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution ADCs
Authors: Mengyuan Ma, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Italo Atzeni, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as an efficient solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to reap high data rates with reasonable power consumption and hardware complexity. In this paper, we study precoding designs for digital, fully connected (FC) hybrid, and partially connected (PC) hybrid beamforming architectures in massive MIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs at the receiver. We aim to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) subject to a transmit power budget and hardware constraints on the analog components. The resulting problems are nonconvex and the quantization distortion introduces additional challenges. To address them, we first derive a tight lower bound for the SE, based on which we optimize the precoders for the three beamforming architectures under the majorization-minorization framework. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed precoding designs over their state-of-the-art counterparts in systems with low-resolution ADCs, particularly those with 1-bit resolution. The results show that the PC hybrid precoding design can achieve an SE close to those of the digital and FC hybrid precoding designs in 1-bit systems, highlighting the potential of the PC hybrid beamforming architectures.

Title: A General Pipeline for Glomerulus Whole-Slide Image Segmentation
Authors: Quan Huu Cap
Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSI) glomerulus segmentation is essential for accurately diagnosing kidney diseases. In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs. The code and pre-trained models are available at this https URL.

Title: mWhisper-Flamingo for Multilingual Audio-Visual Noise-Robust Speech Recognition
Authors: Andrew Rouditchenko, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines lip-based video with audio and can improve performance in noise, but most methods are trained only on English data. One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.

Title: Asymptotic Analysis of One-bit Quantized Box-Constrained Precoding in Large-Scale Multi-User Systems
Authors: Xiuxiu Ma, Abla Kammoun, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.

Title: End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control
Authors: Xiaole Zhang, Peiyu Zhang, Xiongye Xiao, Shixuan Li, Vasileios Tzoumas, Vijay Gupta, Paul Bogdan
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via \textit{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) for \textit{fractional-order linear time-invariant }(FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, \textbf{F}ractional-\textbf{O}rder \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{C}ontrol (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.

Title: High-Dimensional Sequential Change Detection
Authors: Robert Malinas, Dogyoon Song, Benjamin D. Robinson, Alfred O. Hero III
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting a change in the distribution of a high-dimensional multivariate normal time series. Assuming that the post-change parameters are unknown and estimated using a window of historical data, we extend the framework of quickest change detection (QCD) to the highdimensional setting in which the number of variables increases proportionally with the size of the window used to estimate the post-change parameters. Our analysis reveals that an information theoretic quantity, which we call the Normalized High- Dimensional Kullback-Leibler divergence (NHDKL), governs the high-dimensional asymptotic performance of QCD procedures. Specifically, we show that the detection delay is asymptotically inversely proportional to the difference between the NHDKL of the true post-change versus pre-change distributions and the NHDKL of the true versus estimated post-change distributions. In cases of perfect estimation, where the latter NHDKL is zero, the delay is inversely proportional to the NHDKL between the post-change and pre-change distributions alone. Thus, our analysis is a direct generalization of the traditional fixed-dimension, large-sample asymptotic framework, where the standard KL divergence is asymptotically inversely proportional to detection delay. Finally, we identify parameter estimators that asymptotically minimize the NHDKL between the true versus estimated post-change distributions, resulting in a QCD method that is guaranteed to outperform standard approaches based on fixed-dimension asymptotics.

Title: Comprehensive Review of Deep Unfolding Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Sukanya Deka, Kuntal Deka, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Sanjeev Sharma, Vimal Bhatia, Nandana Rajatheva
Abstract: The application of machine learning in wireless communications has been extensively explored, with deep unfolding emerging as a powerful model-based technique. Deep unfolding enhances interpretability by transforming complex iterative algorithms into structured layers of deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach seamlessly integrates domain knowledge with deep learning (DL), leveraging the strengths of both methods to simplify complex signal processing tasks in communication systems. To provide a solid foundation, we first present a brief overview of DL and deep unfolding. We then explore the applications of deep unfolding in key areas, including signal detection, channel estimation, beamforming design, decoding for error-correcting codes, sensing and communication, power allocation, and security. Each section focuses on a specific task, highlighting its significance in emerging 6G technologies and reviewing recent advancements in deep unfolding-based solutions. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with developing deep unfolding techniques and propose potential improvements to enhance their applicability across diverse wireless communication scenarios.

Title: Novelty Detection in Reinforcement Learning with World Models
Authors: Geigh Zollicoffer, Kenneth Eaton, Jonathan Balloch, Julia Kim, Wei Zhou, Robert Wright, Mark O. Riedl
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using world models has found significant recent successes. However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.

Title: Autonomous Driving using Spiking Neural Networks on Dynamic Vision Sensor Data: A Case Study of Traffic Light Change Detection
Authors: Xuelei Chen, Sotirios Spanogianopoulos
Abstract: Autonomous driving is a challenging task that has gained broad attention from both academia and industry. Current solutions using convolutional neural networks require large amounts of computational resources, leading to high power consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an alternative computational model to process information and make decisions. This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles. The efficacy and generalizability of the method will be investigated.

Title: Faster Convergence with Less Communication: Broadcast-Based Subgraph Sampling for Decentralized Learning over Wireless Networks
Authors: Daniel PÃ©rez Herrera, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: Consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) is a widely adopted algorithm for decentralized training of machine learning models across networked agents. A crucial part of D-SGD is the consensus-based model averaging, which heavily relies on information exchange and fusion among the nodes. Specifically, for consensus averaging over wireless networks, communication coordination is necessary to determine when and how a node can access the channel and transmit (or receive) information to (or from) its neighbors. In this work, we propose $\texttt{BASS}$, a broadcast-based subgraph sampling method designed to accelerate the convergence of D-SGD while considering the actual communication cost per iteration. $\texttt{BASS}$ creates a set of mixing matrix candidates that represent sparser subgraphs of the base topology. In each consensus iteration, one mixing matrix is sampled, leading to a specific scheduling decision that activates multiple collision-free subsets of nodes. The sampling occurs in a probabilistic manner, and the elements of the mixing matrices, along with their sampling probabilities, are jointly optimized. Simulation results demonstrate that $\texttt{BASS}$ enables faster convergence with fewer transmission slots compared to existing link-based scheduling methods. In conclusion, the inherent broadcasting nature of wireless channels offers intrinsic advantages in accelerating the convergence of decentralized optimization and learning.

Title: Machine Learning for Scalable and Optimal Load Shedding Under Power System Contingency
Authors: Yuqi Zhou, Hao Zhu
Abstract: Prompt and effective corrective actions in response to unexpected contingencies are crucial for improving power system resilience and preventing cascading blackouts. The optimal load shedding (OLS) accounting for network limits has the potential to address the diverse system-wide impacts of contingency scenarios as compared to traditional local schemes. However, due to the fast cascading propagation of initial contingencies, real-time OLS solutions are challenging to attain in large systems with high computation and communication needs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized design that leverages offline training of a neural network (NN) model for individual load centers to autonomously construct the OLS solutions from locally available measurements. Our learning-for-OLS approach can greatly reduce the computation and communication needs during online emergency responses, thus preventing the cascading propagation of contingencies for enhanced power grid resilience. Numerical studies on both the IEEE 118-bus system and a synthetic Texas 2000-bus system have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our scalable OLS learning design for timely power system emergency operations.

Title: Optimal Configuration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces With Non-uniform Phase Quantization
Authors: Jialong Lu, Rujing Xiong, Tiebin Mi, Ke Yin, Robert Caiming Qiu
Abstract: The existing methods for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) beamforming in wireless communications are typically limited to uniform phase quantization. However, in practical applications, engineering challenges and design requirements often lead to non-uniform phase and bit resolution of RIS units, which limits the performance potential of these methods. To address this issue, this paper pioneers the study of discrete non-uniform phase configuration in RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication and formulates an optimization model to characterize the problem. For single-user scenarios, the paper proposes a partition-andtraversal (PAT) algorithm that efficiently achieves the global optimal solution through systematic search and traversal. For larger-scale multi-user scenarios, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity, an enhanced PAT-based algorithm (E-PAT) is developed. By optimizing the search strategy, the E-PAT algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves linear complexity. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PAT and EPAT algorithms. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the impact of non-uniform phase quantization on system performance.

Title: VideoQA-SC: Adaptive Semantic Communication for Video Question Answering
Authors: Jiangyuan Guo, Wei Chen, Yuxuan Sun, Jialong Xu, Bo Ai
Abstract: Although semantic communication (SC) has shown its potential in efficiently transmitting multimodal data such as texts, speeches and images, SC for videos has focused primarily on pixel-level reconstruction. However, these SC systems may be suboptimal for downstream intelligent tasks. Moreover, SC systems without pixel-level video reconstruction present advantages by achieving higher bandwidth efficiency and real-time performance of various intelligent tasks. The difficulty in such system design lies in the extraction of task-related compact semantic representations and their accurate delivery over noisy channels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SC system, named VideoQA-SC for video question answering (VideoQA) tasks. Our goal is to accomplish VideoQA tasks directly based on video semantics over noisy or fading wireless channels, bypassing the need for video reconstruction at the receiver. To this end, we develop a spatiotemporal semantic encoder for effective video semantic extraction, and a learning-based bandwidth-adaptive deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) scheme for efficient and robust video semantic transmission. Experiments demonstrate that VideoQA-SC outperforms traditional and advanced DJSCC-based SC systems that rely on video reconstruction at the receiver under a wide range of channel conditions and bandwidth constraints. In particular, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, VideoQA-SC can improve the answer accuracy by 5.17% while saving almost 99.5\% of the bandwidth at the same time, compared with the advanced DJSCC-based SC system. Our results show the great potential of SC system design for video applications.

Title: Pointwise-Sparse Actuator Scheduling for Linear Systems with Controllability Guarantee
Authors: Luca Ballotta, Geethu Joseph, Irawati Rahul Thete
Abstract: This paper considers the design of sparse actuator schedules for linear time-invariant systems. An actuator schedule selects, for each time instant, which control inputs act on the system in that instant. We address the optimal scheduling of control inputs under a hard constraint on the number of inputs that can be used at each time. For a sparsely controllable system, we characterize sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and then devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while heuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our greedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based randomized optimization

Title: UNSURE: self-supervised learning with Unknown Noise level and Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate
Authors: JuliÃ¡n Tachella, Mike Davies, Laurent Jacques
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the noise distribution, and ii) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution. The first class of methods tends to be impractical, as the noise level is often unknown in real-world applications, and the second class is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems.

Title: Towards Single-Lens Controllable Depth-of-Field Imaging via Depth-Aware Point Spread Functions
Authors: Xiaolong Qian, Qi Jiang, Yao Gao, Shaohua Gao, Zhonghua Yi, Lei Sun, Kai Wei, Haifeng Li, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang, Jian Bai
Abstract: Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution. To address the depth-varying optical degradation, we introduce a Depth-aware Degradation-adaptive Training (DA2T) scheme. At the dataset level, a Depth-aware Aberration MOS (DAMOS) dataset is established based on the simulation of Point Spread Functions (PSFs) under different object distances. Additionally, we design two plug-and-play depth-aware mechanisms to embed depth information into the aberration image recovery for better tackling depth-aware degradation. Furthermore, we propose a storage-efficient Omni-Lens-Field model to represent the 4D PSF library of various lenses. With the predicted depth map, recovered image, and depth-aware PSF map inferred by Omni-Lens-Field, single-lens controllable DoF imaging is achieved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the recovery performance, and attains impressive single-lens controllable DoF imaging results, providing a seminal baseline for this field. The source code and the established dataset will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Learning Source Disentanglement in Neural Audio Codec
Authors: Xiaoyu Bie, Xubo Liu, GaÃ«l Richard
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have significantly advanced audio compression by efficiently converting continuous audio signals into discrete tokens. These codecs preserve high-quality sound and enable sophisticated sound generation through generative models trained on these tokens. However, existing neural codec models are typically trained on large, undifferentiated audio datasets, neglecting the essential discrepancies between sound domains like speech, music, and environmental sound effects. This oversight complicates data modeling and poses additional challenges to the controllability of sound generation. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Source-Disentangled Neural Audio Codec (SD-Codec), a novel approach that combines audio coding and source separation. By jointly learning audio resynthesis and separation, SD-Codec explicitly assigns audio signals from different domains to distinct codebooks, sets of discrete representations. Experimental results indicate that SD-Codec not only maintains competitive resynthesis quality but also, supported by the separation results, demonstrates successful disentanglement of different sources in the latent space, thereby enhancing interpretability in audio codec and providing potential finer control over the audio generation process.

Title: Learning from Demonstration with Implicit Nonlinear Dynamics Models
Authors: Peter David Fagan, Subramanian Ramamoorthy
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in robotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning a dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for modelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.

Title: Asymptotically Optimal Change Detection for Unnormalized Pre- and Post-Change Distributions
Authors: Arman Adibi, Sanjeev Kulkarni, H. Vincent Poor, Taposh Banerjee, Vahid Tarokh
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalized pre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens in many scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography, magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are difficult to normalize. Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an intuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a biased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation. We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM) algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the log-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is proved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition function and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal performance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required sample size for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance, offering guidelines for practical parameter selection. Numerical studies are provided demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.

Title: kNN For Whisper And Its Effect On Bias And Speaker Adaptation
Authors: Maya K. Nachesa, Vlad Niculae
Abstract: Speech recognition performance varies by language, domain, and speaker characteristics such as accent, but fine-tuning a model on any of these categories may lead to catastrophic forgetting. Token-level $k$ nearest neighbor search ($k$NN), first proposed for neural sequence decoders for natural language generation (NLG) and machine translation (MT), is a non-parametric method that instead adapts using inference-time search in an external datastore, without training the underlying model. We show that Whisper, a transformer end-to-end speech model, benefits from $k$NN. We investigate the differences between the speech and text setups. We discuss implications for speaker adaptation, and analyze improvements by gender, accent, and age.

Title: Robust Persian Digit Recognition in Noisy Environments Using Hybrid CNN-BiGRU Model
Authors: Ali Nasr-Esfahani, Mehdi Bekrani, Roozbeh Rajabi
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced speech recognition applications. However, many existing neural network-based methods struggle with noise, reducing accuracy in real-world environments. This study addresses isolated spoken Persian digit recognition (zero to nine) under noisy conditions, particularly for phonetically similar numbers. A hybrid model combining residual convolutional neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) is proposed, utilizing word units instead of phoneme units for speaker-independent recognition. The FARSDIGIT1 dataset, augmented with various approaches, is processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving 98.53%, 96.10%, and 95.92% accuracy on training, validation, and test sets, respectively. In noisy conditions, the proposed approach improves recognition by 26.88% over phoneme unit-based LSTM models and surpasses the Mel-scale Two Dimension Root Cepstrum Coefficients (MTDRCC) feature extraction technique along with MLP model (MTDRCC+MLP) by 7.61%.

Title: Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery: An RL-based Generative Approach
Authors: Haohan Zou, Jie Feng, Hao Zhao, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.

Title: UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control
Authors: Kaizhen Zhu, Mokai Pan, Yuexin Ma, Yanwei Fu, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at this https URL.
