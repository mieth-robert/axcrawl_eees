Title: Multiple Source Localization via Local Radio Map Construction in Urban Environments
Authors: Qilu Zhang, Hongying Tang, Wen Chen, Ziyi Song, Jiang Wang
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently addressing the multiple source localization (MSL) problem in urban environments, particularly designing a general method adaptable to an arbitrary number of sources, plays a crucial role in various fields such as cognitive radio (CR). Existing methods either fail to effectively utilize received signal strength (RSS) information without redundancy or lack generalizability to an arbitrary number of sources. In this work, we propose the Local Radio Map-Aided Multiple Source Localization Framework (LRM-MSL), which is a general method capable of handling an arbitrary number of sources. First, this framework constructs a local radio map that retains only the RSS information around the sources and binarizes it. Then, the connected component analysis tool is applied to the binarized map, which implements multi-source separation, transforming the MSL problem into a series of single-source localization (SSL) tasks. Finally, we design a numerical coordinate regression network to perform the SSL tasks. Since there is no publicly available RSS dataset for MSL, we construct the VaryTxLoc dataset to evaluate the performance of LRM-MSL. Experimental results demonstrate that LRM-MSL is an accurate and effective method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and dataset can be downloaded from this https URL.

Title: Generative design of stabilizing controllers with diffusion models: the Youla approach
Authors: Matteo Cercola, Donatello Materassi, Simone Formentin
Abstract: Designing controllers that simultaneously achieve strong performance and provable closed-loop stability remains a central challenge in control engineering. This work introduces a diffusion-based generative framework for linear controller synthesis grounded in the Youla-Kucera parameterization, enabling the construction of stabilizing controllers by design. The diffusion model learns a conditional mapping from plant dynamics and desired performance metrics to feasible Youla parameters, guaranteeing internal stability while flexibly accommodating user-specified targets. Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.

Title: TinyMyo: a Tiny Foundation Model for Flexible EMG Signal Processing at the Edge
Authors: Matteo Fasulo, Giusy Spacone, Thorir Mar Ingolfsson, Yawei Li, Luca Benini, Andrea Cossettini
Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality used in several domains, including biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and emerging human-machine interaction paradigms. Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\pm0.16\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\pm0.32\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\pm0.09\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW. By open-sourcing the pre-trained and the downstream task architectures (this https URL), we aim to provide a flexible resource that can accelerate future research and serve as a common foundation for the EMG community.

Title: Run-to-Run Indirect Trajectory Tracking Control of Electromechanical Systems Based on Identifiable and Flat Models
Authors: Eloy Serrano-Seco (1), Edgar Ramirez-Laboreo (1), Eduardo Moya-Lasheras (1) ((1) Universidad de Zaragoza)
Abstract: Differentially flat models are frequently used to design feedforward controllers for electromechanical systems. However, control performance depends on model accuracy, which makes feedback imperative. This paper presents a control scheme for electromechanical systems in which measuring or estimating the output to be controlled -- typically the position -- is not feasible. It employs an identifiable-model-based controller and predictor, coupled with an iterative loop that updates model parameters using the error between a measurable output and its prediction. Simulations on electromechanical switching devices show effective tracking of the desired position trajectory using only coil current measurements.

Title: HiLTS: Human in the Loop Therapeutic System: A Wireless-enabled Precision Medicine Platform for Brainwave Entrainment
Authors: Arfan Ghani
Abstract: Epileptic seizures arise from abnormally synchronised neural activity and remain a major global health challenge, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacological interventions, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience uncontrolled seizures, underscoring the need for alternative neuromodulation strategies. Rhythmic neural entrainment has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for disrupting pathological synchrony, but most existing systems rely on complex analogue electronics or high-power stimulation hardware. This study investigates a minimal digital custom-designed chip that generates a stable 6 Hz oscillation capable of entraining epileptic seizure activity. Using a publicly available EEG seizure dataset, we extracted and averaged analogue seizure waveforms, digitised them to emulate neural front-ends, and directly interfaced the digitised signals with digital output recordings acquired from the chip using a Saleae Logic analyser. The chip pulse train was resampled and low-pass-reconstructed to produce an analogue 6 Hz waveform, allowing direct comparison between seizure morphology, its digitised representation, and the entrained output. Frequency-domain and time-domain analyses demonstrate that the chip imposes a narrow-band 6 Hz rhythm that overrides the broadband spectral profile of seizure activity. These results provide a proof-of-concept for low-power digital custom-designed entrainment as a potential pathway toward simplified, wearable seizure-interruption devices for precision medicine and future healthcare devices.

Title: Keep the Core: Adversarial Priors for Significance-Preserving Brain MRI Segmentation
Authors: Feifei Zhang, Zhenhong Jia, Sensen Song, Fei Shi, Aoxue Chen, Dayong Ren
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is constrained by sparse pathological annotations. Existing augmentation strategies, from conventional transforms to random masking for self-supervision, are feature-agnostic: they often corrupt critical diagnostic semantics or fail to prioritize essential features. We introduce "Keep the Core," a novel data-centric paradigm that uses adversarial priors to guide both augmentation and masking in a significance-preserving manner. Our approach uses SAGE (Sparse Adversarial Gated Estimator), an offline module identifying minimal tokens whose micro-perturbation flips segmentation boundaries. SAGE forges the Token Importance Map $W$ by solving an adversarial optimization problem to maximally degrade performance, while an $\ell_1$ sparsity penalty encourages a compact set of sensitive tokens. The online KEEP (Key-region Enhancement \& Preservation) module uses $W$ for a two-pronged augmentation strategy: (1) Semantic-Preserving Augmentation: High-importance tokens are augmented, but their original pixel values are strictly restored. (2) Guided-Masking Augmentation: Low-importance tokens are selectively masked for an $\text{MAE}$-style reconstruction, forcing the model to learn robust representations from preserved critical features. "Keep the Core" is backbone-agnostic with no inference overhead. Extensive experiments show SAGE's structured priors and KEEP's region-selective mechanism are highly complementary, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation robustness and generalization on 2D medical datasets.

Title: BioimageAIpub: a toolbox for AI-ready bioimaging data publishing
Authors: Stefan Dvoretskii, Anwai Archit, Constantin Pape, Josh Moore, Marco Nolden
Abstract: Modern bioimage analysis approaches are data hungry, making it necessary for researchers to scavenge data beyond those collected within their (bio)imaging facilities. In addition to scale, bioimaging datasets must be accompanied with suitable, high-quality annotations and metadata. Although established data repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR) and BioImage Archive offer rich metadata, their contents typically cannot be directly consumed by image analysis tools without substantial data wrangling. Such a tedious assembly and conversion of (meta)data can account for a dedicated amount of time investment for researchers, hindering the development of more powerful analysis tools. Here, we introduce BioimageAIpub, a workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion, enabling a seamless upload to HuggingFace, a widely used platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models.

Title: SNIC: Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration
Authors: Nik Bhatt
Abstract: Advanced denoising algorithms require large, high-quality datasets. Physics-based, statistical noise models can create such datasets by realistically simulating noise in digital images. However, there is little information on the correct way to calibrate and tune these heteroscedastic models, and a lack of published datasets using them. In this paper, we explore the process of building high-quality heteroscedastic noise models. Our methods produce realistic synthesized noisy images, in both RAW and TIFF formats. Our synthesized noisy images achieve comparable LPIPS results to real noisy images, and greatly outperform those created with manufacturer-provided DNG noise models both in LPIPS and when tested with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising model. Using our approach, we created the Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration dataset (SNIC) containing over 6000 noisy images, comprising 30 scenes from four sensors, including two smartphone sensors, a point-and-shoot, and a DSLR. SNIC is the first synthesized noisy image dataset provided in both RAW and TIFF format.

Title: A Comprehensive Benchmark Platform for Process Control Research of Outdoor Microalgae Raceway Reactors
Authors: Enrique Rodríguez-Miranda, Pablo Otálora, José González-Hernández, José Luis Guzmán, Manuel Berenguel
Abstract: This paper presents a benchmarking framework to evaluate process control strategies in outdoor microalgae raceway reactors, integrating four key control regulation tasks: pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), culture volume through coordinated harvest-dilution actions, and temperature via a sump-mounted spiral heat exchanger. The benchmark is built upon a high-fidelity, experimentally calibrated dynamic model that captures the strongly coupled thermal, physicochemical, and biological processes governing industrial-scale open raceway ponds. A closed-loop simulation environment is provided, featuring realistic actuator constraints, gas transport delays, stiff integration, and a fully specified scenario based on multi-day outdoor disturbances (irradiance, temperature, wind, and humidity). Four user-replaceable controllers define the manipulation of CO2 injection, air bubbling, harvest/dilution sequencing, and heat-exchanger operation. The platform computes a unified global performance index, in addition to individual metrics for each control problem, combining tracking error, gas and energy usage, and biomass productivity, enabling consistent and quantitative comparison of alternative control strategies. Baseline regulatory architectures (On/Off, PI/PID, and Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC)) are included to illustrate the benchmark use for classical and advanced control methods. By providing an openly specified, reproducible, and computationally tractable benchmark with well-defined function interfaces, this work aims to bridge control methodology and outdoor algal bioprocess engineering, and to support the development of multivariable control strategies for disturbance-rich environmental systems.

Title: In search of truth: Evaluating concordance of AI-based anatomy segmentation models
Authors: Lena Giebeler, Deepa Krishnaswamy, David Clunie, Jakob Wasserthal, Lalith Kumar Shiyam Sundar, Andres Diaz-Pinto, Klaus H. Maier-Hein, Murong Xu, Bjoern Menze, Steve Pieper, Ron Kikinis, Andrey Fedorov
Abstract: Purpose AI-based methods for anatomy segmentation can help automate characterization of large imaging datasets. The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations). Conclusions The resources developed are linked from this https URL including segmentation harmonization scripts, summary plots, and visualization tools. This work assists in model evaluation in absence of ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection.

Title: MCR-VQGAN: A Scalable and Cost-Effective Tau PET Synthesis Approach for Alzheimer's Disease Imaging
Authors: Jin Young Kim, Jeremy Hudson, Jeongchul Kim, Qing Lyu, Christopher T. Whitlow
Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.

Title: Lyapunov-based Adaptive Transformer (LyAT) for Control of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Saiedeh Akbari, Xuehui Shen, Wenqian Xue, Jordan C. Insinger, Warren E. Dixon
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-based Adaptive Transformer (LyAT) controller for stochastic nonlinear systems. While transformers have shown promise in various control applications due to sequential modeling through self-attention mechanisms, they have not been used within adaptive control architectures that provide stability guarantees. Existing transformer-based approaches for control rely on offline training with fixed weights, resulting in open-loop implementations that lack real-time adaptation capabilities and stability assurances. To address these limitations, a continuous LyAT controller is developed that adaptively estimates drift and diffusion uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems without requiring offline pre-training. A key innovation is the analytically derived adaptation law constructed from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, which enables real-time weight updates while guaranteeing probabilistic uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking and parameter estimation errors. Experimental validation on a quadrotor demonstrates the performance of the developed controller.

Title: Concurrence: A dependence criterion for time series, applied to biological data
Authors: Evangelos Sariyanidi, John D. Herrington, Lisa Yankowitz, Pratik Chaudhari, Theodore D. Satterthwaite, Casey J. Zampella, Jeffrey S. Morris, Edward Gunning, Robert T. Schultz, Russell T. Shinohara, Birkan Tunc
Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge or large datasets. We introduce a criterion for dependence, whereby two time series are deemed dependent if one can construct a classifier that distinguishes between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data.

Title: Single-View Tomographic Reconstruction Using Learned Primal Dual
Authors: Sean Breckling, Matthew Swan, Keith D. Tan, Derek Wingard, Brandon Baldonado, Yoohwan Kim, Ju-Yeon Jo, Evan Scott, Jordan Pillow
Abstract: The Learned Primal Dual (LPD) method has shown promising results in various tomographic reconstruction modalities, particularly under challenging acquisition restrictions such as limited viewing angles or a limited number of views. We investigate the performance of LPD in a more extreme case: single-view tomographic reconstructions of axially-symmetric targets. This study considers two modalities: the first assumes low-divergence or parallel X-rays. The second models a cone-beam X-ray imaging testbed. For both modalities, training data is generated using closed-form integral transforms, or physics-based ray-tracing software, then corrupted with blur and noise. Our results are then compared against common numerical inversion methodologies.

Title: Synchronization, Identification, and Signal Detection for Underwater Photon-Counting Communications With Input-Dependent Shot Noise
Authors: Fanghua Li, Xiaolin Zhou, Yongkang Chen, Wei Ni, Xin Wang, Dusit Niyato, Ekram Hossain
Abstract: Photon counting (PhC) is an effective detection technology for underwater optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. The presence of signal-dependent Poisson shot noise and asynchronous multi-user interference (MUI) complicates the processing of received data signals, hindering the effective signal detection of PhC OWC systems. This paper proposes a novel iterative signal detection method in grant-free, multi-user, underwater PhC OWC systems with signal-dependent Poisson shot noise. We first introduce a new synchronization algorithm with a unique frame structure this http URL algorithm performs active user identification and transmission delay estimation. Specifically, the estimation is performed first on a user group basis and then at the individual user level with reduced complexity and this http URL also develop a nonlinear iterative multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm that utilizes a detection window for each user to identify interfering symbols and estimate MUI on a slot-by-slot basis, followed by maximum \textit{a-posteriori} probability detection of user this http URL demonstrate that our scheme achieves bit error rates comparable to scenarios with transmission delays known and signal detection perfectly synchronized.

Title: Consensus tracking of perturbed open multi-agent systems with repelling antagonistic interactions
Authors: Mengqi Xue, Yuchao Xiong, Yue Song
Abstract: An open multi-agent system (OMAS) comprises migrating agents which produce a flexible network structure that is naturally switching and size-varying. Meanwhile, agent migrations also make an OMAS more prone to environmental adversities. In this work, we deal with the consensus tracking problem of OMASs suffering these migration-induced adversities, including non-vanishing perturbations in the agent dynamics/state and the repelling antagonistic interactions among agents, over an intermittently disconnected signed digraph. The OMAS is interpreted into a perturbed $M^3D$ system in which unstable subsystems are created when repelling interactions dominate the normal cooperative ones in the OMAS network regardless of its connectivity. To handle the destabilizing effects brought by the repelling interaction as well as the non-vanishing perturbations, we extend the stability theory for $M^3D$ systems and apply it to the OMAS to show that practical consensus tracking can be achieved if the migration-induced switching satisfies the piecewise average dwell time and activation time ratio constraints. Particularly, we indicate that for vanishing perturbations and repelling interactions, asymptotic tracking can be expected under weaker switching constraints.

Title: Simultaneous Secrecy and Covert Communications (SSACC) in Mobility-Aware RIS-Aided Networks
Authors: Yanyu Cheng, Yujian Hu, Haoran Liu, Hua Zhong, Wei Wang, Pan Li, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simultaneous secrecy and covert communications (SSACC) scheme in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided network with a cooperative jammer. The scheme enhances communication security by maximizing the secrecy capacity and the detection error probability (DEP). Under a worst-case scenario for covert communications, we consider that the eavesdropper can optimally adjust the detection threshold to minimize the DEP. Accordingly, we derive closedform expressions for both average minimum DEP (AMDEP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC). To balance AMDEP and ASC, we propose a new performance metric and design an algorithm based on generative diffusion models (GDM) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The algorithm maximizes data rates under user mobility while ensuring high AMDEP and ASC by optimizing power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and superior performance compared to conventional deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods, thereby validating its effectiveness in balancing security and capacity performance.

Title: Black-Start Power Capacity Sizing and Control Strategy for an Islanded DFIG Wind-to-Hydrogen System
Authors: Bosen Yang, Kang Ma, Jin Lin, Yonghua Song
Abstract: This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.

Title: Fast Collaborative Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding
Authors: Ce Zheng, Ke Zhang, Sun Chen, Wenqi Zhang, Qiong Liu, Angesom Ataklity Tesfay
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a small draft model to predict multiple future tokens for verification by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this enables device-edge collaborative inference but introduces significant uplink overhead, as existing distributed speculative decoding schemes transmit full vocabulary logits at every step. We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability. Experiments show that TSLT significantly reduces uplink communication while maintaining end-to-end inference latency and model quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable, communication-efficient distributed LLM inference in future AI-RAN systems.

Title: CPMamba: Selective State Space Models for MIMO Channel Prediction in High-Mobility Environments
Authors: Sheng Luo, Jiashu Xie, Yueling Che, Junmei Yao, Jian Tian, Daquan Feng, Kaishun Wu
Abstract: Channel prediction is a key technology for improving the performance of various functions such as precoding, adaptive modulation, and resource allocation in MIMO-OFDM systems. Especially in high-mobility scenarios with fast time-varying channels, it is crucial for resisting channel aging and ensuring communication quality. However, existing methods suffer from high complexity and the inability to accurately model the temporal variations of channels. To address this issue, this paper proposes CPMamba -- an efficient channel prediction framework based on the selective state space model. The proposed CPMamba architecture extracts features from historical channel state information (CSI) using a specifically designed feature extraction and embedding network and employs stacked residual Mamba modules for temporal modeling. By leveraging an input-dependent selective mechanism to dynamically adjust state transitions, it can effectively capture the long-range dependencies between the CSIs while maintaining a linear computational complexity. Simulation results under the 3GPP standard channel model demonstrate that CPMamba achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy across all scenarios, along with superior generalization and robustness. Compared to existing baseline models, CPMamba reduces the number of parameters by approximately 50 percent while achieving comparable or better performance, thereby significantly lowering the barrier for practical deployment.

Title: Learning Recursive Attenuation Filters Under Noisy Conditions
Authors: Gloria Dal Santo, Karolina Prawda, Sebastian J. Schlecht, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: Recursion is a fundamental concept in the design of filters and audio systems. In particular, artificial reverberation systems that use delay networks depend on recursive paths to control both echo density and the decay rate of modal components. The differentiable digital signal processing framework has shown promise in automatically tuning both recursive and non-recursive elements given a target room impulse response. This is done by applying gradient descent to loss functions based on energy-decay or spectrogram differences. However, these representations are highly sensitive to background noise, which is ubiquitous in real measurements, producing spurious loss minima and leading to incorrect attenuation. This paper addresses the problem of tuning recursive attenuation filters of a feedback delay network when targets are noisy. We examine the loss landscape associated with different optimization objectives and propose a method that ensures correct minima under low signal-to-noise conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through statistical analysis on 80 individual optimization examples. The results reveal that explicitly modeling the noise restores correct minima. Furthermore, we identify the sensitivity of attenuation filter parameters tuning to perturbations in frequency-independent parameters. These findings provide practical guidelines for more robust and reproducible gradient-based optimization of feedback delay networks.

Title: Closed Loop Reference Optimization for Extrusion Additive Manufacturing
Authors: Rawan Hoteit, Andrea Balestra, Nathan Mingard, Efe C. Balta, John Lygeros
Abstract: Various defects occur during material extrusion additive manufacturing processes that degrade the quality of the 3D printed parts and lead to significant material waste. This motivates feedback control of the extrusion process to mitigate defects and prevent print failure. We propose a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for closed-loop control with force feedback to provide accurate width tracking of the extruded filament. Furthermore, we propose preemptive optimization of the reference force given to the LQR that accounts for the performance of the LQR and generates the optimal reference for the closed loop extrusion dynamics and machine constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the improved tracking performance and response time. Experiments on a Fused Filament Fabrication 3D printer showcase a root mean square error improvement of 39.57% compared to tracking the unmodified reference as well as an 83.7% shorter settling time.

Title: Using Seminorms To Analyze Contraction of Switched Systems With Only Non-Contracting Modes
Authors: Edwin Baum, Zonglin Liu, Yuzhen Qin, Olaf Stursberg
Abstract: This paper investigates contraction properties of switched dynamical systems for the case that all modes are non-contracting, thereby extending existing results that require at least one mode to be contracting. Leveraging the property that unstable systems may still exhibit stable behavior within certain subspaces, conditions are provided which ensure contracting evolution within a given subspace of the state space of the switched system. These conditions are derived using the concepts of seminorms and semi-contracting systems. Then, by selecting a set of subspaces whose corresponding seminorms form a separating family of the state space, and by verifying whether a given mode is contracting in each subspace, conditions on the activation time of each mode are provided by which contraction on the complete state space is guaranteed. Numerical examples are presented for illustration.

Title: Contraction Analysis of Filippov Solutions in Multi-Modal Piecewise Smooth Systems
Authors: Zonglin Liu, Kyra Borchhardt, Olaf Stursberg
Abstract: This paper provides conditions to ensure contractive behavior of Filippov solutions generated by multi-modal piecewise smooth (PWS) systems. These conditions are instrumental in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of PWS systems, such as convergence towards an equilibrium point or a limit cycle. The work is motivated by a known principle for contraction analysis of bimodal PWS systems which ensures that the flow dynamics of each mode and the sliding dynamics on the switching manifold are contracting. This approach is extended first to PWS systems with multiple non-intersecting switching manifolds in Rn, and then to two intersecting switching manifolds in R2. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings, along with a discussion on extensions to more general intersecting switching manifolds in Rn.

Title: Optimal chiller loading including transients
Authors: Manuel R. Arahal, Manuel G. Satué, Manuel G. Ortega
Abstract: Scheduling and loading of chillers in a multi-chiller plant is considered. A new framework is introduced considering an extended set of independent variables for the optimization problem of energy consumption. In this way the number of decision variables is increased, providing extra degrees of freedom to optimize cooling plant operation. The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation solution is deployed for the problem and the proposed method is compared with a similar but static approach showing the benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption.

Title: Economic versus energetic model predictive control of a cold production plant with thermal energy storage
Authors: Manuel G. Satué, Manuel R. Arahal, Luis F. Acedo, Manuel G. Ortega
Abstract: Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.

Title: BEST-STD2.0: Balanced and Efficient Speech Tokenizer for Spoken Term Detection
Authors: Anup Singh, Kris Demuynck, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Fast and accurate spoken content retrieval is vital for applications such as voice search. Query-by-Example Spoken Term Detection (STD) involves retrieving matching segments from an audio database given a spoken query. Token-based STD systems, which use discrete speech representations, enable efficient search but struggle with robustness to noise and reverberation, and with inefficient token utilization. We address these challenges by proposing a noise and reverberation-augmented training strategy to improve tokenizer robustness. In addition, we introduce optimal transport-based regularization to ensure balanced token usage and enhance token efficiency. To further speed up retrieval, we adopt a TF-IDF-based search mechanism. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms STD baselines across various distortion levels while maintaining high search efficiency.

Title: An active-set algorithm for spectral unmixing
Authors: Nils Foix-Colonier, Sébastien Bourguignon
Abstract: Linear spectral unmixing under nonnegativity and sum-to-one constraints is a convex optimization problem for which many algorithms were proposed. In practice, especially for supervised unmixing (i.e., with a large dictionary), solutions tend to be sparse due to the nonnegativity of the abundances, thereby motivating the use of an active-set solver. Given the problem specific features, it seems advantageous to design a dedicated algorithm in order to gain computational performance compared to generic solvers. In this paper, we propose to derive such a specific algorithm, while extending the nonnegativity constraints to broader minimum abundance constraints.

Title: Robust 6G OFDM High-Mobility Communications Using Delay-Doppler Superimposed Pilots

Abstract: In this work, a novel receiver architecture for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications in 6G high-mobility scenarios is developed. In particular, a delay-Doppler superimposed pilot (SP) scheme is used for channel estimation (CE) by adding a single pilot in the delay-Doppler domain. Unlike previous research on delay-Doppler superimposed pilots in OFDM systems, intercarrier interference (ICI) effects, fractional delays, and Doppler shifts are considered. Consequently, a disjoint fractional delay-Doppler estimation algorithm is derived, and a reduced-complexity equalization method based on the Landweber iteration, which exploits intrinsic channel structure, is proposed. Simulation results reveal that the proposed receiver architecture achieves robust communication performance across various mobility conditions, with speeds of up to 1000 km/h, and increases the effective throughput compared to existing methods.

Title: From Liability to Asset: A Three-Mode Grid-Forming Control Framework for Centralized Data Center UPS Systems
Authors: Mohamed Shamseldein
Abstract: AI workloads are turning large data centers into highly dynamic power-electronic loads; fault-time behavior and workload pulsing can stress weak-grid points of interconnection. This paper proposes a centralized medium-voltage (MV) uninterruptible power supply (UPS) control architecture implemented as three operating modes: Mode 1 regulates a DC stiff bus and shapes normal-operation grid draw, Mode 2 enforces current-limited fault-mode P--Q priority with UPS battery energy storage system (UPS-BESS) buffering and a rate-limited post-fault "soft return," and Mode 3 optionally provides droop-based fast frequency response via grid-draw modulation. Fundamental-frequency averaged dq simulations (50 MW block, short-circuit ratio (SCR) = 1.5, 0.5 p.u. three-phase dip for 150~ms) show zero unserved information-technology (IT) energy (0.00000 MWh vs.0.00208 MWh for a momentary-cessation benchmark), a 0.57 p.u. peak inverter current (vs. 1.02 p.u. for a synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) baseline), a nonzero mean fault-window grid draw of 0.20~p.u. (this http URL 0 for momentary cessation), and an improved settled point-of-common-coupling (PCC) voltage minimum of 0.79 p.u. after one cycle (vs. 0.66 p.u.). A forced-oscillation case study applies a 1 Hz pulsed load (+/- 0.25 p.u.) and shows that the normal-operation shaping filters the oscillation seen by the grid while the UPS-BESS buffers the pulsing component.

Title: Efficient Precoding for LEO Satellites: A Low-Complexity Matrix Inversion Method via Woodbury Matrix Identity and arSVD
Authors: Mohammad Momani, Thomas Delamotte, Andreas Knopp
Abstract: The increasing deployment of massive active antenna arrays in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites necessitates computationally efficient and adaptive precoding techniques to mitigate dynamic channel variations and enhance spectral efficiency. Regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding is widely used in multi-user MIMO systems; however, its real-time implementation is limited by the computationally intensive inversion of the Gram matrix. In this work, we develop a low-complexity framework that integrates the Woodbury (WB) formula with adaptive randomized singular value decomposition (arSVD) to efficiently update the Gram matrix inverse as the satellite moves along its orbit. By leveraging low-rank perturbations, the WB formula reduces inversion complexity, while arSVD dynamically extracts dominant singular components, further enhancing computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves computational savings of up to 61\% compared to conventional RZF precoding with full matrix inversion, while incurring only a modest degradation in sum-rate performance. These results demonstrate that WB-arSVD offers a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation satellite communications, facilitating real-time deployment in power-constrained environments.

Title: Learning-based Approximate Model Predictive Control for an Impact Wrench Tool
Authors: Mark Benazet, Francesco Ricca, Dario Bralla, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Andrea Carron
Abstract: Learning-based model predictive control has emerged as a powerful approach for handling complex dynamics in mechatronic systems, enabling data-driven performance improvements while respecting safety constraints. However, when computational resources are severely limited, as in battery-powered tools with embedded processors, existing approaches struggle to meet real-time requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of real-time torque control for impact wrenches, where high-frequency control updates are necessary to accurately track the fast transients occurring during periodic impact events, while maintaining high-performance safety-critical control that mitigates harmful vibrations and component wear. The key novelty of the approach is that we combine data-driven model augmentation through Gaussian process regression with neural network approximation of the resulting control policy. This insight allows us to deploy predictive control on resource-constrained embedded platforms while maintaining both constraint satisfaction and microsecond-level inference times. The proposed framework is evaluated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments on a custom impact wrench testbed. The results show that our approach successfully achieves real-time control suitable for high-frequency operation while maintaining constraint satisfaction and improving tracking accuracy compared to baseline PID control.

Title: Channel State Information Preprocessing for CSI-based Physical-Layer Authentication Using Reconciliation
Authors: Atsu Kokuvi Angelo Passah, Rodrigo C. de Lamare, Arsenia Chorti
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive preprocessing technique to enhance the accuracy of channel state information-based physical layer authentication (CSI-PLA) alleviating CSI variations and inconsistencies in the time domain. To this end, we develop an adaptive robust principal component analysis (A-RPCA) preprocessing method based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA). The performance evaluation is then conducted using a PLA framework based on information reconciliation, in which Gaussian approximation (GA) for Polar codes is leveraged for the design of short codelength Slepian Wolf decoders. Furthermore, an analysis of the proposed A-RPCA methods is carried out. Simulation results show that compared to a baseline scheme without preprocessing and without reconciliation, the proposed A-RPCA method substantially reduces the error probability after reconciliation and also substantially increases the detection probabilities that is also 1 in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. We have compared against state-of the-art preprocessing schemes in both synthetic and real datasets, including principal component analysis (PCA) and robust PCA, autoencoders and the recursive projected compressive sensing (ReProCS) framework and we have validated the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Title: Misspecified Crame-Rao Bound for AoA Estimation at a ULA under a Spoofing Attack
Authors: Sotiris Skaperas, Arsenia Chorti
Abstract: A framework is presented for analyzing the impact of active attacks to location-based physical layer authentication (PLA) using the machinery of misspecified Cramér--Rao bound (MCRB). In this work, we focus on the MCRB in the angle-of-arrival (AoA) based authentication of a single antenna user when the verifier posseses an $M$ antenna element uniform linear array (ULA), assuming deterministic pilot signals; in our system model the presence of a spoofing adversary with an arbitrary number $L$ of antenna elements is assumed. We obtain a closed-form expression for the MCRB and demonstrate that the attack introduces in it a penalty term compared to the classic CRB, which does not depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but on the adversary's location, the array geometry and the attacker precoding vector.

Title: Observer-based Differentially Private Consensus for Linear Multi-agent Systems
Authors: Xiaofeng Zong, Ming-Yu Wang, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates the differentially private consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) based on output feedback protocols. To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of \epsilon-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an \epsilon*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.

Title: Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification via Integrated Complex Variational Mode Decomposition and Spatial Attention Transfer
Authors: Chenyu Zhu, Zeyang Li, Ziyi Xie, Jie Zhang
Abstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) utilizes passive hardware characteristics to authenticate transmitters, providing a robust physical-layer security solution. However, most deep-learning-based methods rely on extensive data or require prior information, which poses challenges in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose an integrated complex variational mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes and reconstructs complex-valued signals to approximate the original transmitted signals, thereby enabling more accurate feature extraction. We further utilize a temporal convolutional network to effectively model the sequential signal characteristics, and introduce a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively weight informative signal segments, significantly enhancing identification performance. Additionally, the branch network allows leveraging pre-trained weights from other data while reducing the need for auxiliary datasets. Ablation experiments on the simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model. An accuracy comparison on a public dataset reveals that our method achieves 96% accuracy using only 10 symbols without requiring any prior knowledge.

Title: A Fast Volumetric Capture and Reconstruction Pipeline for Dynamic Point Clouds and Gaussian Splats
Authors: Athanasios Charisoudis, Simone Croci, Lam Kit Yung, Pascal Frossard, Aljosa Smolic
Abstract: We present a fast and efficient volumetric capture and reconstruction system that processes either RGB-D or RGB-only input to generate 3D representations in the form of point clouds and Gaussian splats. For Gaussian splat reconstructions, we took the GPS-Gaussian regressor and improved it, enabling high-quality reconstructions with minimal overhead. The system is designed for easy setup and deployment, supporting in-the-wild operation under uncontrolled illumination and arbitrary backgrounds, as well as flexible camera configurations, including sparse setups, arbitrary camera numbers and baselines. Captured data can be exported in standard formats such as PLY, MPEG V-PCC, and SPLAT, and visualized through a web-based viewer or Unity/Unreal plugins. A live on-location preview of both input and reconstruction is available at 5-10 FPS. We present qualitative findings focused on deployability and targeted ablations. The complete framework is open-source, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

Title: DiscoverDCP: A Data-Driven Approach for Construction of Disciplined Convex Programs via Symbolic Regression
Authors: Sveinung Myhre
Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

Title: A Context-Free Smart Grid Model Using Complex System Approach
Authors: Soufian Ben Amor, Alain Bui, Guillaume Guerard
Abstract: Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming
Authors: Ningwei Bai, Chi Pui Chan, Qichen Yin, Tengyang Gong, Yunda Yan, Zezhi Tang
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.

Title: A Survey on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Practical Systems: Security and Privacy Perspectives
Authors: Ziyu Chen, Yitong Shen, Jingzhe Zhang, Yao Zheng, Yili Ren, Xuyu Wang, Shiwen Mao, Hanqing Guo
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping wireless environments through dynamic manipulation of electromagnetic waves. While extensive research has explored their theoretical benefits for communication and sensing, practical deployments in smart environments such as homes, vehicles, and industrial settings remain limited and under-examined, particularly from security and privacy perspectives. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of RIS applications in real-world systems, with a focus on the security and privacy threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies relevant to practical use. We analyze scenarios with two types of systems (with and without legitimate RIS) and two types of attackers (with and without malicious RIS), and demonstrate how RIS may introduce new attacks to practical systems, including eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. In response, we review defenses against RIS-related attacks in these systems, such as applying additional security algorithms, disrupting attackers, and early detection of unauthorized RIS. We also discuss scenarios in which the legitimate user applies an additional RIS to defend against attacks. To support future research, we also provide a collection of open-source tools, datasets, demos, and papers at: this https URL. By highlighting RIS's functionality and its security/privacy challenges and opportunities, this survey aims to guide researchers and engineers toward the development of secure, resilient, and privacy-preserving RIS-enabled practical wireless systems and environments.

Title: Secure AI-Driven Super-Resolution for Real-Time Mixed Reality Applications
Authors: Mohammad Waquas Usmani, Sankalpa Timilsina, Michael Zink, Susmit Shannigrahi
Abstract: Immersive formats such as 360° and 6DoF point cloud videos require high bandwidth and low latency, posing challenges for real-time AR/VR streaming. This work focuses on reducing bandwidth consumption and encryption/decryption delay, two key contributors to overall latency. We design a system that downsamples point cloud content at the origin server and applies partial encryption. At the client, the content is decrypted and upscaled using an ML-based super-resolution model. Our evaluation demonstrates a nearly linear reduction in bandwidth/latency, and encryption/decryption overhead with lower downsampling resolutions, while the super-resolution model effectively reconstructs the original full-resolution point clouds with minimal error and modest inference time.

Title: Feasibility of Radio Frequency Based Wireless Sensing of Lead Contamination in Soil
Authors: Yixuan Gao, Tanvir Ahmed, Mikhail Mohammed, Zhongqi Cheng, Rajalakshmi Nandakumar
Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.

Title: BUILD with Precision: Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs
Authors: Hamed Ajorlou, Samuel Rey, Gonzalo Mateos, Geert Leus, Antonio G. Marques
Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

Title: Learning High-Quality Initial Noise for Single-View Synthesis with Diffusion Models
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Xuejun Yang, Weihua Liu, Mouquan Shen
Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

Title: Machine Learning-based Optimal Control for Colloidal Self-Assembly
Authors: Andres Lizano-Villalobos, Fangyuan Ma, Wentao Tang, Wei Sun, Xun Tang
Abstract: Achieving precise control of colloidal self-assembly into specific patterns remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex process dynamics. Recently, machine learning-based state representation and reinforcement learning-based control strategies have started to accumulate popularity in the field, showing great potential in achieving an automatable and generalizable approach to producing patterned colloidal assembly. In this work, we adopted a machine learning-based optimal control framework, combining unsupervised learning and graph convolutional neural work for state observation with deep reinforcement learning-based optimal control policy calculation, to provide a data-driven control approach that can potentially be generalized to other many-body self-assembly systems. With Brownian dynamics simulations, we demonstrated its superior performance as compared to traditional order parameter-based state description, and its efficacy in obtaining ordered 2-dimensional spherical colloidal self-assembly in an electric field-mediated system with an actual success rate of 97%.

Title: Reconfigurable Silicon Photonics Extreme Learning Machine with Random Non-linearities as Neural Processor and Physical Unclonable Function
Authors: George Sarantoglou, Georgios Aias Karydis, Adonis Bogris, Charis Mesaritakis
Abstract: An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token.

Title: Batch Normalization-Free Fully Integer Quantized Neural Networks via Progressive Tandem Learning
Authors: Pengfei Sun, Wenyu Jiang, Piew Yoong Chee, Paul Devos, Dick Botteldooren
Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

Title: Poster: Recognizing Hidden-in-the-Ear Private Key for Reliable Silent Speech Interface Using Multi-Task Learning
Authors: Xuefu Dong, Liqiang Xu, Lixing He, Zengyi Han, Ken Christofferson, Yifei Chen, Akihito Taya, Yuuki Nishiyama, Kaoru Sezaki
Abstract: Silent speech interface (SSI) enables hands-free input without audible vocalization, but most SSI systems do not verify speaker identity. We present HEar-ID, which uses consumer active noise-canceling earbuds to capture low-frequency "whisper" audio and high-frequency ultrasonic reflections. Features from both streams pass through a shared encoder, producing embeddings that feed a contrastive branch for user authentication and an SSI head for silent spelling recognition. This design supports decoding of 50 words while reliably rejecting impostors, all on commodity earbuds with a single model. Experiments demonstrate that HEar-ID achieves strong spelling accuracy and robust authentication.

Title: Pseudo-Cepstrum: Pitch Modification for Mel-Based Neural Vocoders

Abstract: This paper introduces a cepstrum-based pitch modification method that can be applied to any mel-spectrogram representation. As a result, this method is compatible with any mel-based vocoder without requiring any additional training or changes to the model. This is achieved by directly modifying the cepstrum feature space in order to shift the harmonic structure to the desired target. The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank. These pitch-shifted mel-spectrogram features can be converted to speech with any compatible vocoder. The proposed method is validated experimentally with objective and subjective metrics on various state-of-the-art neural vocoders as well as in comparison with traditional pitch modification methods.

Authors: Marcelo Rosa, José E. R. Cury, Fabio L. Baldissera
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of coordinating multiple robots to build 3-D structures. This problem consists of a set of mobile robots that interact with each other in order to autonomously build a predefined 3-D structure. Our approach is based on Supervisory Control Theory, and it allows us to synthesize from models that represent a single robot and the target structure a correct-by-construction reactive controller, called supervisor. When this supervisor is replicated for the other robots, then the target structure can be completed by all robots

Title: Resilience of coupled systems under deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity: An integrative literature review
Authors: Jannie Coenen, Vítor Vasconcelos, Heiman Wertheim, Marcel Olde Rikkert, Sophie Hadjisotiriou, Vittorio Nespeca, Tom Oreel, Rick Quax, Etiënne Rouwette, Vincent Marchau, Hubert Korzilius
Abstract: Resilience in coupled systems is increasingly critical in addressing global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. These systems show unpredictable behaviour due to dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty across spatiotemporal scales. Despite growing interest, few studies systematically integrate both concepts when assessing resilience. This paper conducts an integrative review of 102 English-language publications to identify gaps in current approaches. Findings reveal that most papers address lower levels of uncertainty and rarely consider dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty simultaneously, which limits the effectiveness of resilience strategies. To advance systems research, we propose a conceptual framework and practical tools to support researchers and decision-makers in evaluating and improving resilience. The paper also outlines future research directions for more robust, adaptive, and integrative resilience assessments.

Title: Exploiting Radio Frequency Fingerprints for Device Identification: Tackling Cross-receiver Challenges in the Source-data-free Scenario
Authors: Liu Yang, Qiang Li, Luxiong Wen, Jian Yang
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

Title: Subspace tracking: a novel measurement method to test the standard phase noise model of optical frequency combs
Authors: Darko Zibar, Holger Heebøll, Jasper Riebesehl, Michael Galili, Francesco Da Ros, Aleksandr Razumov
Abstract: The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) assisted coherent detection has been a cornerstone of modern fiber-optic communication systems. The ability to digitally, i.e. after analogue-to-digital converter, compensate for chromatic dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, and phase noise has rendered traditional analog feedback loops largely obsolete. While analog techniques remain prevalent for phase noise characterization of single-frequency lasers, the phase noise characterization of optical frequency combs presents a greater challenge. This complexity arises from different number of phase noise sources affecting an optical frequency comb. Here, we show how a phase noise measurement techniques method based on multi-heterodyne coherent detection and DSP-based subspace tracking can be used to identify, measure and quantify various phase noise sources associated with an optical frequency comb.

Title: Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Bahman Abolhassani, Tugba Erpek, Kemal Davaslioglu, Yalin E. Sagduyu, Sastry Kompella
Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.

Title: Optimizing tiny colorless feedback delay networks
Authors: Gloria Dal Santo, Karolina Prawda, Sebastian J. Schlecht, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: A common bane of artificial reverberation algorithms is spectral coloration in the synthesized sound, typically manifesting as metallic ringing, leading to a degradation in the perceived sound quality. In delay network methods, coloration is more pronounced when fewer delay lines are used. This paper presents an optimization framework in which a tiny differentiable feedback delay network, with as few as four delay lines, is used to learn a set of parameters to iteratively reduce coloration. The parameters under optimization include the feedback matrix, as well as the input and output gains. The optimization objective is twofold: to maximize spectral flatness through a spectral loss while maintaining temporal density by penalizing sparseness in the parameter values. A favorable narrow distribution of modal excitation is achieved while maintaining the desired impulse response density. In a subjective assessment, the new method proves effective in reducing perceptual coloration of late reverberation. Compared to the author's previous work, which serves as the baseline and utilizes a sparsity loss in the time domain, the proposed method achieves computational savings while maintaining performance. The effectiveness of this work is demonstrated through two application scenarios where smooth-sounding synthetic room impulse responses are obtained via the introduction of attenuation filters and an optimizable scattering feedback matrix.

Title: Similarity Metrics For Late Reverberation
Authors: Gloria Dal Santo, Karolina Prawda, Sebastian J. Schlecht, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: Automatic tuning of reverberation algorithms relies on the optimization of a cost function. While general audio similarity metrics are useful, they are not optimized for the specific statistical properties of reverberation in rooms. This paper presents two novel metrics for assessing the similarity of late reverberation in room impulse responses. These metrics are differentiable and can be utilized within a machine-learning framework. We compare the performance of these metrics to two popular audio metrics using a large dataset of room impulse responses encompassing various room configurations and microphone positions. The results indicate that the proposed functions based on averaged power and frequency-band energy decay outperform the baselines with the former exhibiting the most suitable profile towards the minimum. The proposed work holds promise as an improvement to the design and evaluation of reverberation similarity metrics.

Title: Convergent Primal-Dual Plug-and-Play Image Restoration: A General Algorithm and Applications
Authors: Yodai Suzuki, Ryosuke Isono, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: We propose a general deep plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm with a theoretical convergence guarantee. PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence.

Title: Tri-timescale Beamforming Design for Tri-hybrid Architectures with Reconfigurable Antennas
Authors: Mengzhen Liu, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu
Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas possess the capability to dynamically adjust their fundamental operating characteristics, thereby enhancing system adaptability and performance. To fully exploit this flexibility in modern wireless communication systems, this paper considers a novel tri-hybrid beamforming architecture, which seamlessly integrates pattern-reconfigurable antennas with both analog and digital beamforming. The proposed tri-hybrid architecture operates across three layers: (\textit{i}) a radiation beamformer in the electromagnetic (EM) domain for dynamic pattern alignment, (\textit{ii}) an analog beamformer in the radio-frequency (RF) domain for array gain enhancement, and (\textit{iii}) a digital beamformer in the baseband (BB) domain for multi-user interference mitigation. To establish a solid theoretical foundation, we first develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the tri-hybrid beamforming system and formulate the signal model for a multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario. The optimization objective is to maximize the sum-rate while satisfying practical constraints. Given the challenges posed by high pilot overhead and computational complexity, we introduce an innovative tri-timescale beamforming framework, wherein the radiation beamformer is optimized over a long-timescale, the analog beamformer over a medium-timescale, and the digital beamformer over a short-timescale. This hierarchical strategy effectively balances performance and implementation feasibility. Simulation results validate the performance gains of the proposed tri-hybrid architecture and demonstrate that the tri-timescale design significantly reduces pilot overhead and computational complexity, highlighting its potential for future wireless communication systems.

Title: StructDiff: Structure-aware Diffusion Model for 3D Fine-grained Medical Image Synthesis
Authors: Jiahao Xia, Yutao Hu, Yaolei Qi, Zhenliang Li, Wenqi Shao, Junjun He, Ying Fu, Longjiang Zhang, Guanyu Yang
Abstract: Solving medical imaging data scarcity through semantic image generation has attracted growing attention in recent years. However, existing generative models mainly focus on synthesizing whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited capability in reproducing fine-grained anatomical details. Due to the stringent requirement of topological consistency and the complex 3D morphological heterogeneity of medical data, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, we propose StructDiff, a Structure-aware Diffusion Model for fine-grained 3D medical image synthesis, which enables precise generation of topologically complex anatomies. In addition to the conventional mask-based guidance, StructDiff further introduces a paired image-mask template to guide the generation process, providing structural constrains and offering explicit knowledge of mask-to-image correspondence. Moreover, a Mask Generation Module (MGM) is designed to enrich mask diversity and alleviate the scarcity of high-quality reference masks. Furthermore, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy based on Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV), which mitigates uncertainty introduced by imperfect synthetic data when transferring to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StructDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of topological consistency and visual realism, and significantly boosts downstream segmentation performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Blinding the Wiretapper: RIS-Enabled User Occultation in the ISAC Era
Authors: Getuar Rexhepi, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: An undesirable consequence of the foreseeable proliferation of sophisticated integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technologies is the enabling of spoofing, by malicious agents, of situational information (such as proximity, direction or location) of legitimate users of wireless systems. In order to mitigate this threat, we present a novel ISAC scheme that, aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), enables the occultation of the positions of user equipment (UE) from wiretappers, while maintaining both sensing and desired communication performance between the UEs and a legitimate base station (BS). To that end, we first formulate an RIS phase-shift optimization problem that jointly maximizes the sum-rate performance of the UEs (communication objective), while minimizing the projection of the wiretapper's effective channel onto the legitimate channel (hiding objective), thereby disrupting the attempts by a wiretapper of localizing the UEs. Then, in order to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex joint optimization problem, a novel manifold optimization algorithm is derived, whose effectiveness is validated by numerical results, which demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves legitimate ISAC performance while significantly degrading the wiretapper's sensing capability.

Title: Verifiable Natural Language to Linear Temporal Logic Translation: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Suite
Authors: William H English, Chase Walker, Dominic Simon, Sumit Kumar Jha, Rickard Ewetz
Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of four unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions. While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii) translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here: this https URL bench.

Title: Improving Action Smoothness for a Cascaded Online Learning Flight Control System
Authors: Yifei Li, Erik-jan van Kampen
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.

Title: Joint Power Allocation and Reflecting-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Aided Communications Under CSI Uncertainty
Authors: Christos N. Efrem, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low computational complexity on average.

Title: TransUNet-GradCAM: A Hybrid Transformer-U-Net with Self-Attention and Explainable Visualizations for Foot Ulcer Segmentation
Authors: Akwasi Asare, Mary Sagoe, Justice Williams Asare, Stephen Edward Moore
Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we employ the TransUNet architecture, a hybrid framework that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net structure. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution. We trained the model on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset using a robust augmentation pipeline and a hybrid loss function to mitigate class imbalance. On the internal validation set, the model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (F1-score) of 0.8886 using an optimized threshold of 0.4843. Crucially, to assess generalizability, we performed external validation on two independent datasets: the AZH Wound Care Center dataset (n=278) and the Medetec dataset (n=152). Without any retraining, the model achieved Dice scores of 0.6209 and 0.7850, respectively, demonstrating robust zero-shot transferability to unseen clinical domains. Furthermore, clinical utility analysis revealed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.9749) between predicted and ground-truth wound areas. These outcomes demonstrate that our approach effectively integrates global and local feature extraction, offering a reliable, effective, and explainable solution for automated foot ulcer assessment.

Title: Team Westwood Solution for MIDOG 2025 Challenge: An Ensemble-CNN-Based Approach For Mitosis Detection And Classification
Authors: Tengyou Xu, Haochen Yang, Xiang 'Anthony' Chen, Hongyan Gu, Mohammad Haeri
Abstract: This abstract presents our solution (Team Westwood) for mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification in the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge. For mitosis detection, we trained an nnUNetV2 for initial mitosis candidate screening with high sensitivity, followed by a random forest classifier ensembling predictions of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and EfficientNetV2-s. For the atypical mitosis classification, we trained another random forest classifier ensembling the predictions of three CNNs: EfficientNet-b3, EfficientNet-b5, and InceptionV3. On the preliminary test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.7450 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8722 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification. On the final test set, our solution achieved an F1 score of 0.6972 for track 1 mitosis detection, and a balanced accuracy of 0.8242 for track 2 atypical mitosis classification.

Title: Optimizing the Network Topology of a Linear Reservoir Computer
Authors: Sahand Tangerami, Nicholas A. Mecholsky, Francesco Sorrentino
Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of the network that underlies a reservoir computer (RC) is generated randomly, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the connectivity of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both training and testing phases and often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.

Title: Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations
Authors: Paul-Erik Haacker, Remco I. Leine, Renu Chaudhary, Kai Diethelm, André Schmidt, Safoura Hashemishahraki
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.

Title: Bayesian model selection and misspecification testing in imaging inverse problems only from noisy and partial measurements
Authors: Tom Sprunck, Marcelo Pereyra, Tobias Liaudat
Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection accuracy with a low computational cost.

Authors: Patricio Guzmán, Felipe Labra, Hugo Parada (SPHINX, IECL)
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.

Title: Meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised optic disc and cup segmentation on fundus images
Authors: Pandega Abyan Zumarsyah, Igi Ardiyanto, Hanung Adi Nugroho
Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.

Title: Energy-Efficient Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Integrated Data and Energy Transfer Assisted by Fluid Antennas
Authors: Long Zhang, Yizhe Zhao, Halvin Yang, Guangming Liang, Jie Hu
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is considered as a key enabler of 6G, as it can provide both wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless data transfer (WDT) services towards low power devices. Thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided by fluid antenna (FA), incorporating FA into IDET systems presents a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency performance. This paper investigates a FA assisted IDET system, where the transmitter is equipped with multiple FAs and transmits wireless signals to the data receiver (DR) and the energy receiver (ER), which are both equipped with a single traditional antenna. The switching delay and energy consumption induced by port selection are taken into account in IDET system for the first time. We aim to obtain the optimal beamforming vector and the port selection strategy at the transmitter, in order to maximize the short-term and long-term WET efficiency, respectively. The instant sub-optimal solution is obtained by alternatively optimizing the beamforming vector and port selection in each transmission frame, while a novel constrained soft actor critic (C-SAC) algorithm is proposed to find the feasible policy of port selection from the long-term perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve greater gain in terms of both the short-term and long-term WET efficiency compared to other benchmarks, while not degrading WDT performance.

Title: Dual-Channel Tomographic Tactile Skin with Pneumatic Pressure Sensing for Improved Force Estimation
Authors: Haofeng Chen, Jiri Kubik, Bedrich Himmel, Matej Hoffmann, Hyosang Lee
Abstract: Tactile skins based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) enable large-area contact localization with few electrodes, but suffer from nonuniform sensitivity that limits force estimation accuracy. This work introduces a dual-channel tactile skin that integrates an EIT layer with a pneumatic pressure layer and a calibration framework that leverages their complementary strengths. The EIT layer provides robust multi-contact localization, while the pneumatic pressure layer supplies a stable scalar measurement that serves as contact force estimation. A location-aware correction method is introduced, learning smooth spatial gain and offset fields from a single-session calibration, enabling spatially consistent multi-contact force estimation. The proposed system achieves accurate force estimation across diverse contact configurations, generalizes to varying indenter sizes, and preserves EIT's inherent advantages in multi-contact localization. By letting the pneumatic pressure layer handle the force estimation and using the EIT layer to determine where each contact occurs, the method avoids the need for large datasets, complicated calibration setups, and heavy machine-learning pipelines often required by previous EIT-only approaches. This dual-channel design provides a practical, scalable, and easy-to-calibrate solution for building large-area robotic skins.

Subsequently, we explore the foundational characteristics of WLAM, delving into their unique relevance in wireless environments. Then, the role of WLAM in optimizing wireless communication systems across various use cases and the reciprocal benefits are systematically investigated. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of WLAM with emerging technologies, highlighting their potential to enable transformative capabilities and breakthroughs in wireless communication. Finally, we thoroughly examine the high-level challenges hindering the practical implementation of WLAM and discuss pivotal future research directions.

Title: Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems
Authors: Jinnan Piao, Dong Li, Yiming Sun, Zhibo Li, Ming Yang, Xueting Yu
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve control and communication performance. In this algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoder. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information and the iterative structure can reduce the block error rate performance of communications while improving the root mean square error performance of controls.

Title: Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models
Authors: Grigory Neustroev, Diego A. Tejada-Arango, German Morales-Espana, Mathijs M. de Weerdt
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose the method of hull clustering with blended RPs to enhance traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), approximating the full time horizon more accurately and with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.

Title: Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment
Authors: Maureen de Seyssel, Eeshan Gunesh Dhekane
Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the evaluation aspect being measured, the model capabilities required to attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it. We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody, interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

Title: FARM: Fine-Tuning Geospatial Foundation Models for Intra-Field Crop Yield Regression
Authors: Shayan Nejadshamsi, Yuanyuan Zhang, Shadi Zaki, Brock Porth, Lysa Porth, Vahab Khoshdel
Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper introduces FARM: Fine-tuning Agricultural Regression Models, a deep learning framework designed for high-resolution, intra-field canola yield prediction. FARM leverages a pre-trained, large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense, pixel-level (30 m) yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Canadian Prairies, FARM achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.44 and an R^2 of 0.81. Using an independent high-resolution yield monitor dataset, we further show that fine-tuning FARM on limited ground-truth labels outperforms training the same architecture from scratch, confirming the benefit of pre-training on large, upsampled county-level data for data-scarce precision agriculture. These results represent improvement over baseline architectures like 3D-CNN and DeepYield, which highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By providing a continuous, high-resolution output, FARM offers a more actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.

Title: Cartan meets Cramér-Rao
Authors: Sunder Ram Krishnan
Abstract: A Cartan-geometric, jet bundle formulation of curvature-aware variance bounds in parametric statistical estimation is developed. Building on our earlier extrinsic Hilbert space approach to the Cramér-Rao and Bhattacharyya-type inequalities, we show that the curvature corrections induced by the square root embedding of a statistical model admit a canonical intrinsic interpretation via jet geometry and Cartan's prolongation theory. For a scalar-parameter family with square root map $s_\theta=\sqrt{f(\cdot;\theta)}\in L^2(\mu)$, we regard $s_\theta$ as a section of the statistical bundle $E=\Theta\times L^2(\mu)$ and study its finite-order prolongations. We point out that the classical algebraic efficiency condition--that the estimator residual $(T-\theta)s_\theta$ lies in the span of derivatives of $s_\theta$ up to order $m$--is equivalent to the existence of a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of order $m$ satisfied by the square root map. Geometrically, this means the prolonged section lies in an ODE-defined submanifold of the jet bundle and is an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. The obstruction to such finite-order integrability is identified with the vertical component of the canonical Ehresmann connection on the jet tower, which coincides with the curvature correction term in variance bounds. This establishes a direct correspondence between algebraic projection conditions in $L^2(\mu)$ and intrinsic holonomy properties of statistical sections, yielding a unified geometric interpretation of higher-order information inequalities.

Title: Synthetic Electrogram Generation with Variational Autoencoders for ECGI
Authors: Miriam Gutiérrez-Fernández, Karen López-Linares, Carlos Fambuena-Santos, María S. Guillem, Andreu M. Climent, Óscar Barquero-Pérez
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its clinical assessment requires accurate characterization of atrial electrical activity. Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.

Title: Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization
Authors: Yen-Ju Lu, Kunxiao Gao, Mingrui Liang, Helin Wang, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak, Jesus Villalba
Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. We release an online demo at this https URL, with plans to release the full dataset in the near future. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

Title: Historical Information Accelerates Decentralized Optimization: A Proximal Bundle Method
Authors: Zhao Zhu, Yu-Ping Tian, Xuyang Wu
Abstract: Historical information, such as past function values or gradients, has significant potential to enhance decentralized optimization methods for two key reasons: first, it provides richer information about the objective function, which also explains its established success in centralized optimization; second, unlike the second-order derivative or its alternatives, historical information has already been computed or communicated and requires no additional cost to acquire. Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence. Numerical experiments on classification problems demonstrate that by using historical information, our methods yield faster convergence and stronger robustness in the step-sizes.
