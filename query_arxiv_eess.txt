Title: OPF-Based Optimal Power System Network Restoration Considering Frequency Dynamics
Authors: Dawn Virginillo, Asja Derviškadić, Mario Paolone
Abstract: Due to recent blackout and system split incidents in power grids worldwide, as well as increased system complexity in view of the energy transition, there has been increasing interest in re-evaluating existing Power System Restoration (PSR) plans. In restoration scenarios, due to low island inertia, it is necessary to ensure not only the static, but also the dynamic stability of the system. In this paper, we pose and solve a formulation of the optimal PSR problem including frequency dynamics. We validate the switching constraints for global optimality within a static version of the formulation using a brute-force tree search method. We apply the dynamic problem formulation to the IEEE 9-Bus model, and show that the optimal switching sequence using the static formulation would violate dynamic constraints, illustrating the importance of dynamic considerations in PSR planning.

Title: Joint Power Allocation and Radiation Optimization in NOMA-Assisted Pinching Antenna Systems
Authors: Nikoloz Vashakidze, Chadi Assi, Mohamed Elhattab, Ali Ghrayeb, Maurice J. Khabbaz
Abstract: This paper explores a joint optimization of transmit power allocation and radiation coefficients in a downlink Pinching Antenna SyStem (PASS) employing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). By leveraging the PASS-enabled flexible channel adjustment and NOMA's power allocation adaptability, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated with the objective of simultaneously optimizing base station (BS)'s transmit power coefficients and pinching antenna (PA)'s radiation powers. Due to its non-convexity and complexity, the formulated optimization problem is challenging to solve directly. Hence, we decompose the main problem into two sub-problems, namely transmit power allocation sub-problem and PA radiation power allocation sub-problem. In the first sub-problem, closed-form solutions are derived for the BS's power allocation among NOMA users. Meanwhile, in the second sub-problem, we optimize the PA's radiation power utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA). These two sub-problems are solved alternatively using Alternating Optimization (AO) until convergence. It should be noted that decoding order plays a significant role in NOMA-assisted PASS. Hence, two variations of decoding order are considered, namely: i) a high-complexity exhaustive search approach, and, ii) a low-complexity alternative that utilizes pre-determined channel information. Numerical results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the system's sum-rate compared to widely adopted equal power allocation PASS schemes.

Title: LG-NuSegHop: A Local-to-Global Self-Supervised Pipeline For Nuclei Instance Segmentation
Authors: Vasileios Magoulianitis, Catherine A. Alexander, Jiaxin Yang, C.-C. Jay Kuo
Abstract: Nuclei segmentation is the cornerstone task in histology image reading, shedding light on the underlying molecular patterns and leading to disease or cancer diagnosis. Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL) models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology. There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent and explainable to physicians.

Title: Two-timescale Beamforming Optimization for Downlink Multi-user Holographic MIMO Surfaces
Authors: Haochen Wu, Yuanbin Chen, Yang Ming, Zhaocheng Wang
Abstract: Benefiting from the rapid development of metamaterials and metasurfaces, the holographic multiple-input and multiple-output surface (HMIMOS) has been regarded as a promising solution for future wireless networks recently. By densely packing numerous radiation elements together, HMIMOS is capable of realizing accurate beamforming with low hardware complexity. However, enormous radiation elements on the HMIMOS lead to high computational complexity and signaling overhead when applying traditional beamforming schemes relying on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To tackle this problem, we propose a two-timescale optimization scheme to minimize the required transmission power under the constraint of all users' quality-of-service (QoS). Specifically, the beampatterns at the base station (BS) and the user equippment (UE) are optimized over the slowly changing statistical CSI based on the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Then, the instantaneous CSI is utilized to design the precoding matrix in order to ensure the system performance without significant increase in computational cost, due to the small number of feeds on the HMIMOS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other baselines.

Title: 4D Imaging in ISAC Systems: A Framework Based on 5G NR Downlink Signals
Authors: Haoyang Weng, Haisu Wu, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, supporting spectrum sharing and hardware integration. Beyond communication enhancement, ISAC also enables high-accuracy environment reconstruction and imaging, which are crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and digital twins. This paper proposes a 4D imaging framework fully compliant with the 5G New Radio (NR) protocol, ensuring compatibility with cellular systems. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end processing chain that covers waveform generation, echo processing, and multi-BS point cloud fusion. Furthermore, we introduce Zoom-OMP, a coarse-to-fine sparse recovery algorithm for high-resolution angle estimation that achieves high accuracy with reduced computational cost. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves robust 4D imaging performance with superior spatial accuracy and reconstruction quality compared to conventional benchmarks, paving the way for practical ISAC-enabled environment reconstruction in 6G networks.

Title: Computationally Efficient Spline-Based Modeling of DER Dynamics for Voltage Stability in Active Distribution Networks
Authors: Shadrack T. Asiedu, Tara Aryal, Zongjie Wang, Hossein Moradi Rekabdarkolaee, Timothy M. Hansen
Abstract: The increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into power systems necessitates the accurate representation of their dynamic behavior at the transmission level. Traditional electromagnetic transient models (EMT), while effective, face scalability challenges due to their reliance on detailed system information. Data-driven approaches, such as System Identification (SysID), offer a promising alternative by modeling system dynamics without detailed system knowledge. However, SysID and similar methods are computationally intensive, requiring the computation of complex ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or transfer functions estimation. This makes them less effective for real-time operation. We therefore propose a novel data-driven approach that simplifies the modeling of DERs dynamics by leveraging B-splines to transform discrete system data into continuous differentiable functions. This enables the estimation of lower order linear ordinary differential equations with simple linear regression to represent the underlying dynamics at a very low computational cost. Furthermore, the extracted dynamic equations are discretized by the backward Euler method for potential integration into discrete-time power dispatch models. Validation results indicate a goodness-of-fit (GoF) of 98.74%, comparable to the 99.03% GoF of the SysID method, yet, 4.8 times faster. Our proposed model's execution time of less than one minute makes it more suitable for real-time applications in power system operations.

Title: Strategic Decision-Making Under Uncertainty through Bi-Level Game Theory and Distributionally Robust Optimization
Authors: Jiachen Shen, Jian Shi, Lei Fan, Chenye Wu, Dan Wang, Choong Seon Hong, Zhu Han
Abstract: In strategic scenarios where decision-makers operate at different hierarchical levels, traditional optimization methods are often inadequate for handling uncertainties from incomplete information or unpredictable external factors. To fill this gap, we introduce a mathematical framework that integrates bi-level game theory with distributionally robust optimization (DRO), particularly suited for complex network systems. Our approach leverages the hierarchical structure of bi-level games to model leader-follower interactions while incorporating distributional robustness to guard against worst-case probability distributions. To ensure computational tractability, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used to transform the bi-level challenge into a more manageable single-level model, and the infinite-dimensional DRO problem is reformulated into a finite equivalent. We propose a generalized algorithm to solve this integrated model. Simulation results validate our framework's efficacy, demonstrating that under high uncertainty, the proposed model achieves up to a 22\% cost reduction compared to traditional stochastic methods while maintaining a service level of over 90\%. This highlights its potential to significantly improve decision quality and robustness in networked systems such as transportation and communication networks.

Title: Channel Knowledge Map Construction: Recent Advances and Open Challenges
Authors: Zixiang Ren, Juncong Zhou, Jie Xu, Ling Qiu, Yong Zeng, Han Hu, Juyong Zhang, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a pivotal technology for environment-aware wireless communications and sensing, which provides a priori location-specific channel knowledge to facilitate network optimization. Efficient CKM construction is an important technical problem for its effective implementation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in CKM construction. First, we examine classical interpolation-based CKM construction methods, highlighting their limitations in practical deployments. Next, we explore image processing and generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which leverage feature extraction to construct CKMs based on environmental knowledge. Furthermore, we present emerging wireless radiance field (WRF) frameworks that exploit neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting to construct high-fidelity CKMs from sparse measurement data. Finally, we outline various future research directions in real-time and cross-domain CKM construction, as well as cost-efficient deployment of CKMs.

Title: UHDRes: Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration via Dual-Domain Decoupled Spectral Modulation
Authors: S. Zhao (1), W. Lu (1 and 2), B. Wang (1), T. Wang (3), K. Zhang (4), H. Zhao (1) ((1) College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, China, (2) Nasdaq, St. John's, Canada, (3) vivo Mobile Communication Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China, (4) College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Australia)
Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images often suffer from severe degradations such as blur, haze, rain, or low-light conditions, which pose significant challenges for image restoration due to their high resolution and computational demands. In this paper, we propose UHDRes, a novel lightweight dual-domain decoupled spectral modulation framework for UHD image restoration. It explicitly models the amplitude spectrum via lightweight spectrum-domain modulation, while restoring phase implicitly through spatial-domain refinement. We introduce the spatio-spectral fusion mechanism, which first employs a multi-scale context aggregator to extract local and global spatial features, and then performs spectral modulation in a decoupled manner. It explicitly enhances amplitude features in the frequency domain while implicitly restoring phase information through spatial refinement. Additionally, a shared gated feed-forward network is designed to efficiently promote feature interaction through shared-parameter convolutions and adaptive gating mechanisms. Extensive experimental comparisons on five public UHD benchmarks demonstrate that our UHDRes achieves the state-of-the-art restoration performance with only 400K parameters, while significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage.

Title: PECL: A Heterogeneous Parallel Multi-Domain Network for Radar-Based Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Jiuqi Yan, Chendong Xu, Dongyu Liu
Abstract: Radar systems are increasingly favored for medical applications because they provide non-intrusive monitoring with high privacy and robustness to lighting conditions. However, existing research typically relies on single-domain radar signals and overlooks the temporal dependencies inherent in human activity, which complicates the classification of similar actions. To address this issue, we designed the Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM (PECL) network to process data in three complementary domains: Range-Time, Doppler-Time, and Range-Doppler. PECL combines a channel-spatial attention module and temporal units to capture more features and dynamic dependencies during action sequences, improving both accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that PECL achieves an accuracy of 96.16% on the same dataset, outperforming existing methods by at least 4.78%. PECL also performs best in distinguishing between easily confused actions. Despite its strong performance, PECL maintains moderate model complexity, with 23.42M parameters and 1324.82M FLOPs. Its parameter-efficient design further reduces computational cost.

Title: J-SGFT: Joint Spatial and Graph Fourier Domain Learning for Point Cloud Attribute Deblocking
Authors: Muhammad Talha, Qi Yang, Zhu Li, Anique Akhtar, Geert Van Der Auwera
Abstract: Point clouds (PC) are essential for AR/VR and autonomous driving but challenge compression schemes with their size, irregular sampling, and sparsity. MPEG's Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (GPCC) methods successfully reduce bitrate; however, they introduce significant blocky artifacts in the reconstructed point cloud. We introduce a novel multi-scale postprocessing framework that fuses graph-Fourier latent attribute representations with sparse convolutions and channel-wise attention to efficiently deblock reconstructed point clouds. Against the GPCC TMC13v14 baseline, our approach achieves BD-rate reduction of 18.81\% in the Y channel and 18.14\% in the joint YUV on the 8iVFBv2 dataset, delivering markedly improved visual fidelity with minimal overhead.

Title: Fundamental Models and Signal Processing for Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Communications and Sensing
Authors: Zhenyu Xiao, Xiangyu Pi, Songqi Cao, Lipeng Zhu, Zhen Gao, Xiang-Gen Xia, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has been recognized as a promising technology for performance enhancement in wireless communication and sensing systems by exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in flexible antenna movement. However, the integration of MAs into next-generation wireless networks still faces design challenges due to the paradigm shift from conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) to MAs, which motivates this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the models, scenarios, and signal processing techniques for MA-enhanced wireless networks. First, we introduce several efficient methods to realize flexible antenna movement. Next, channel models based on field response and spatial correlation are presented to characterize the channel variations with respect to MA movement. Then, we discuss the advantages and challenges of applying MAs to typical application scenarios of wireless communications and sensing. Moreover, we show the signal processing techniques for MA-enhanced communication and sensing systems, including channel acquisition and antenna position optimization. Finally, we highlight promising research directions to inspire future investigations.

Title: Average and Worst-case Analysis of MIMO Beamforming Loss due to Hardware Impairments
Authors: Xuan Chen (INSA Rennes, IETR), Matthieu Crussière (INSA Rennes, IETR), Luc Le Magoarou (INSA Rennes, IETR)
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of hardware impairments in antenna arrays on the beamforming performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems. We consider two types of imperfections: per-element gain mismatches and inter-element spacing deviations. We analytically determine the impairment configurations that result in the worst-case degradation. In addition, the analytical expression of the average-case performance is also derived for comparison. Simulation and theoretical results show that the average SNR degradation remains relatively limited, whereas the worst-case scenarios can exhibit substantially higher losses. These findings provide clear insight into the robustness limits of MIMO systems under practical hardware imperfections.

Title: Evaluating the Impact of a Load Admittance Approximation in Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Alex Junior da Cunha Coelho, Araceli Hernandez, Luis Badesa
Abstract: The Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF) incorporates dynamic stability constraints into the OPF formulation to ensure secure and economical operation under disturbances. While discretizing system dynamics enables the use of nonlinear programming techniques, it significantly increases computational burden. To enhance scalability, many studies simplify the network by representing loads as constant admittances, allowing the use of Kron reduction. However, computing the Kron reduction outside the optimization requires a voltage-based assumption to convert loads from constant power to constant admittance. This paper proposes a practical voltage-based load admittance approximation and evaluates the errors it may introduce in rotor angle and speed deviation trajectories. Case studies on the WECC 9-bus system show that the proposed approach reproduces rotor dynamics consistent with time-domain simulations during the first few seconds while considerably reducing implementation effort and mitigating convergence issues. The proposed framework thus offers a simple and effective strategy for scalable TSC-OPF implementations.

Title: Predicting and forecasting reactivity and flux using long short-term memory models in pebble bed reactors during run-in
Authors: Ian Kolaja, Ludovic Jantzen, Tatiana Siaraferas, Massimiliano Fratoni
Abstract: Pebble bed reactor (PBR) operation presents unique advantages and challenges due to the ability to continuously change the fuel mixture and excess reactivity. Each operation parameter affects reactivity on a different timescale. For example, fuel insertion changes may take months to fully propagate, whereas control rod movements have immediate effects. In-core measurements are further limited by the high temperatures, intense neutron flux, and dynamic motion of the fuel bed. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are trained to predict reactivity, flux profiles, and power profiles as functions of operating history and synthetic batch-level pebble measurements, such as discharge burnup distributions. The model's performance is evaluated using unseen temporal data, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.9914 on the testing set. The capability of the network to forecast reactivity responses to future operational changes is also examined, and its application for optimizing reactor running-in procedures is explored.

Title: Near-optimal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Configuration: Blind Beamforming with Sensing
Authors: Son Dinh-Van, Nam Phuong Tran, Matthew D. Higgins
Abstract: Blind beamforming has emerged as a promising approach to configure reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) without relying on channel state information (CSI) or geometric models, making it directly compatible with commodity hardware. In this paper, we propose a new blind beamforming algorithm, so-called Blind Optimal RIS Beamforming with Sensing (\textsc{BORN}), that operates using only received signal strength (RSS). In contrast to existing methods that rely on majority-voting mechanisms, \textsc{BORN} exploits the intrinsic quadratic structure of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The algorithm proceeds in two stages: \emph{sensing}, where a quadratic model is estimated from RSS measurements, and \emph{optimization}, where the RIS configuration is obtained using the estimated quadratic model. Our novelties are twofold. Firstly, we show for the first time, that \textsc{BORN} can achieve provable near-optimal performance using only $O(N \log_2(N))$ samples, where $N$ is the number of RIS elements. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that quadratic models are learnable under Rademacher feature distributions when the second-order coefficient matrix is low-rank. This result, to our knowledge, has not been established in prior matrix sensing literature. Secondly, extensive simulations and real-world field tests demonstrate that \textsc{BORN} achieves near-optimal performance, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art blind beamforming algorithms, particularly in scenarios with a weak background channel such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS).

Title: Synthesizing speech with selected perceptual voice qualities - A case study with creaky voice
Authors: Frederik Rautenberg, Fritz Seebauer, Jana Wiechmann, Michael Kuhlmann, Petra Wagner, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach
Abstract: The control of perceptual voice qualities in a text-to-speech (TTS) system is of interest for applications where unmanipu- lated and manipulated speech probes can serve to illustrate pho- netic concepts that are otherwise difficult to grasp. Here, we show that a TTS system, that is augmented with a global speaker attribute manipulation block based on normalizing flows1 , is capable of correctly manipulating the non-persistent, localized quality of creaky voice, thus avoiding the necessity of a, typi- cally unreliable, frame-wise creak predictor. Subjective listen- ing tests confirm successful creak manipulation at a slightly re- duced MOS score compared to the original recording.

Title: Look Before Switch: Sensing-Assisted Handover in 5G NR V2I Networks
Authors: Yunxin Li, Fan Liu, Haoqiu Xiong, Zhenkun Wang, Narengerile, Christos Masouros
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising solution in addressing the challenges of high-mobility scenarios in 5G NR Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. This paper proposes a novel sensing-assisted handover framework that leverages ISAC capabilities to enable precise beamforming and proactive handover decisions. Two sensing-enabled handover triggering algorithms are developed: a distance-based scheme that utilizes estimated spatial positioning, and a probability-based approach that predicts vehicle maneuvers using interacting multiple model extended Kalman filter (IMM-EKF) tracking. The proposed methods eliminate the need for uplink feedback and beam sweeping, thus significantly reducing signaling overhead and handover interruption time. A sensing-assisted NR frame structure and corresponding protocol design are also introduced to support rapid synchronization and access under vehicular mobility. Extensive link-level simulations using real-world map data demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the average handover interruption time by over 50%, achieves lower handover rates, and enhances overall communication performance.

Title: Millimeter-Scale Absolute Carrier Phase-Based Localization in Multi-Band Systems
Authors: Andrea Bedin, Joerg Widmer, Melanny Davila, Marco Canil, Rafael Ruiz
Abstract: Localization is a key feature of future Sixth Generation (6G) net-works with foreseen accuracy requirements down to the millimeter level, to enable novel applications in the fields of telesurgery, high-precision manufacturing, and others. Currently, such accuracy requirements are only achievable with specialized or highly resource-demanding systems, rendering them impractical for more wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we present the first system that enables low-complexity and low-bandwidth absolute 3D localization with millimeter-level accuracy in generic wireless networks. It performs a carrier phase-based wireless localization refinement of an initial location estimate based on successive location-likelihood optimization across multiple bands. Unlike previous phase unwrapping methods, our solution is one-shot. We evaluate its performance collecting ~350, 000 measurements, showing an improvement of more than one order of magnitude over classical localization techniques. Finally, we will open-source the low-cost, modular FR3 front-end that we developed for the experimental campaign.

Title: Neural Operators for Power Systems: A Physics-Informed Framework for Modeling Power System Components
Authors: Ioannis Karampinis, Petros Ellinas, Johanna Vorwerk, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: Modern power systems require fast and accurate dynamic simulations for stability assessment, digital twins, and real-time control, but classical ODE solvers are often too slow for large-scale or online applications. We propose a neural-operator framework for surrogate modeling of power system components, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to learn mappings from system states and time-varying inputs to full trajectories without step-by-step integration. To enhance generalization and data efficiency, we introduce Physics-Informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), which embed the residuals of governing equations into the training loss. Our results show that DeepONets, and especially PI-DeepONets, achieve accurate predictions under diverse scenarios, providing over 30 times speedup compared to high-order ODE solvers. Benchmarking against Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights superior stability and scalability. Our results demonstrate neural operators as a promising path toward real-time, physics-aware simulation of power system dynamics.

Title: Transporter: A 128$\times$4 SPAD Imager with On-chip Encoder for Spiking Neural Network-based Processing
Authors: Yang Lin, Claudio Bruschini, Edoardo Charbon
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are widely used today in time-resolved imaging applications. However, traditional architectures rely on time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and histogram-based processing, leading to significant data transfer and processing challenges. Previous work based on recurrent neural networks has realized histogram-free processing. To further address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm that eliminates TDCs by integrating in-sensor spike encoders. This approach enables preprocessing of photon arrival events in the sensor while significantly compressing data, reducing complexity, and maintaining real-time edge processing capabilities. A dedicated spike encoder folds multiple laser repetition periods, transforming phase-based spike trains into density-based spike trains optimized for spiking neural network processing and training via backpropagation through time. As a proof of concept, we introduce Transporter, a 128$\times$4 SPAD sensor with a per-pixel D flip-flop ring-based spike encoder, designed for intelligent active time-resolved imaging. This work demonstrates a path toward more efficient, neuromorphic SPAD imaging systems with reduced data overhead and enhanced real-time processing.

Title: Voltage-Independent Active-Power Droop Coefficient for Enhanced Andronov-Hopf Oscillator Grid-Forming Inverters
Authors: Hamed Rezazadeh, Mohammad Monfared, Meghdad Fazeli, Saeed Golestan
Abstract: In recent years, virtual oscillator control, particularly the Andronov-Hopf oscillator (AHO), has received widespread attention for controlling grid-forming (GFM) inverters due to their superior dynamic response. However, traditional AHO systems feature droop coefficients that are dependent on the oscillator voltage amplitude, limiting their ability to maintain consistent grid support during disturbances and resulting in power-sharing inaccuracies. This paper presents an enhanced AHO (EAHO) strategy, where the active power droop coefficient is no longer a function of the voltage amplitude and retains the key dynamic benefits of the original AHO. The EAHO improves both frequency and voltage support and ensures accurate power sharing with other GFM inverters in grid-connected and stand-alone modes. Extensive comparative and small-signal analyses, alongside experimental validation on 2.5 kVA single-phase inverters, confirm the EAHO's improved steady-state performance, enhanced active and reactive power support, and stable operation under varying grid conditions.

Title: Location-Informed Interference Suppression Precoding Methods for Distributed Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Emiel Vanspranghels, Raquel Marina Noguera Oishi, Franco Minucci, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: The evolution of mobile networks towards user-centric cell-free distributed Massive MIMO configurations requires the development of novel signal processing techniques. More specifically, digital precoding algorithms have to be designed or adopted to enable distributed operation. Future deployments are expected to improve coexistence between cellular generations, and between mobile networks and incumbent services such as radar. In dense cell-free deployments, it might also not be possible to have full channel state information for all users at all antennas. To leverage location information in a dense deployment area, we suggest and investigate several algorithmic alterations on existing precoding methods, aimed at location-informed interference suppression, for usage in existing and emerging systems where user locations are known. The proposed algorithms are derived using a theoretical channel model and validated and numerically evaluated using an empirical dataset containing channel measurements from an indoor distributed Massive MIMO testbed. When dealing with measured CSI, the impact of the hardware, in addition to the location-based channel, needs to be compensated for. We propose a method to calibrate the hardware and achieve measurement-based evaluation of our location-based interference suppression algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods allow location-based interference suppression without explicit CSI knowledge at the transmitter, under certain realistic network conditions.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Cramér-Rao Lower Bound
Authors: Jieming Ke, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper establishes the privacy-preserving Cramér-Rao (CR) lower bound theory, characterizing the fundamental limit of identification accuracy under privacy constraint. An identifiability criterion under privacy constraint is derived by using Fisher information matrix as the privacy metric. In the identifiable case, the privacy-preserving CR lower bound is established and its attainability is demonstrated, thereby ensuring the existence of the privacy-preserving Fisher information matrix with explicit expression. Then, the privacy-preserving CR lower bound theory is extended to the multi-sensor multi-measurement system. Specifically, the additivity principle of privacy-preserving Fisher information matrices across both spatial and temporal dimensions is established, building a relationship between privacy-preserving CR lower bounds for the multi-sensor multi-measurement system and its subsystems. Using this additivity principle, distributed identification algorithms capable of achieving the privacy-preserving CR lower bound are further proposed. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the privacy-preserving CR lower bound and show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Efficient CNN Inference on Ultra-Low-Power MCUs via Saturation-Aware Convolution
Authors: Shiming Li, Luca Mottola, Yuan Yao, Stefanos Kaxiras
Abstract: Deploying lightweight CNN inference tasks on ultra-low-power MCUs is often not limited by space constraint, thanks to the compact size of models, yet inference latency is crucial for preserving energy. We reveal that quantized CNN inference on ultra-low-power MCUs executes unnecessary computations in neurons that produce saturated output values: often times, these neurons still produce the correct output value without fully completing the computation, since the neuron value is too extreme and is eventually systematically clamped at the boundaries allowed by the neuron. We show that with carefully designed condition checks, it is possible to identify and skip these unnecessary computations without impacting the neuron output. Based on this, we present saturation-aware convolution: an inference technique whereby computations in convolution kernels are executed in an altered order to induce earlier saturation, and saturation checks are inserted to omit unnecessary computations. We integrate our implementation into MCUNet's TinyEngine, the state-of-the-art neural network code generation and inference framework, and conduct experiments on a Cortex-M0+ MCU. The result based on 7 open-source CNN models displays up to 24% inference time saving, with strictly zero impact on neural network accuracy.

Title: Coherency Control in Power Systems
Authors: Rodrigo Bernal, Ignacio Ponce, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper proposes a coherency control strategy for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) to establish coherence among power system devices. Using the equivalence of the Complex Frequency (CF) of the injected currents as the definition for coherency among devices, the control enforces an output current with a proportional magnitude and a constant phase shift relative to a reference. This formulation makes the control technology-agnostic, enabling coherency with any type of resource. Case studies based on the two-area and IEEE 39-bus systems demonstrate the controller's potential to improve damping and overall dynamic behavior. The paper further evaluates practical implementation aspects including delay/noise sensitivity and the trade-off between oscillation mitigation and disturbance propagation. This work establishes coherency as a viable direct control objective for IBRs in modern power systems.

Title: A Tilting-Rotor Enhanced Quadcopter Fault-Tolerant Control Based on Non-Linear Model Predictive Control
Authors: Yanchao Wang, Xu You, Mehdi Baghdadi
Abstract: This paper proposes a fault-tolerant control strategy based on a tilt-rotor quadcopter prototype, utilizing nonlinear model predictive control to maintain both attitude and position stability in the event of rotor failure. The control strategy employs an extended state observer to predict model deviations following a fault and adjusts the original model in the subsequent time step, thereby achieving active fault-tolerant control. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations and compared to both traditional quadcopter and tilt-rotor quadcopter without observer under identical conditions. The results demonstrate that the tilt-rotor quadcopter can maintain position control without sacrificing yaw stability, unlike traditional quadcopters.

Title: A Penny for Your Thoughts: Decoding Speech from Inexpensive Brain Signals
Authors: Quentin Auster, Kateryna Shapovalenko, Chuang Ma, Demaio Sun
Abstract: We explore whether neural networks can decode brain activity into speech by mapping EEG recordings to audio representations. Using EEG data recorded as subjects listened to natural speech, we train a model with a contrastive CLIP loss to align EEG-derived embeddings with embeddings from a pre-trained transformer-based speech model. Building on the state-of-the-art EEG decoder from Meta, we introduce three architectural modifications: (i) subject-specific attention layers (+0.15% WER improvement), (ii) personalized spatial attention (+0.45%), and (iii) a dual-path RNN with attention (-1.87%). Two of the three modifications improved performance, highlighting the promise of personalized architectures for brain-to-speech decoding and applications in brain-computer interfaces.

Title: Predicting Cognitive Assessment Scores in Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Using Wearable Sensors
Authors: Assma Habadi, Milos Zefran, Lijuan Yin, Woojin Song, Maria Caceres, Elise Hu, Naoko Muramatsu
Abstract: Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23 older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature, and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results: Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.

Title: TAPOM: Task-Space Topology-Guided Motion Planning for Manipulating Elongated Object in Cluttered Environments
Authors: Zihao Li, Yiming Zhu, Zhe Zhong, Qinyuan Ren, Yijiang Huang
Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex real-world environments.

Title: Performance Analysis of One- and Two-way DV-QKD with MIMO FSO Communication Systems
Authors: Sushil Kumar, Soumya P. Dash, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system wherein two legitimate users attempt to exchange secret keys over free-space optical (FSO) channels. Novel frameworks for the use of the one- and two-way discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) protocols, employing weak coherent pulses and decoy states, are presented. Focusing on the case where a photon-number-splitting attack is adopted by the eavesdropper and the legitimate multi-antenna receiver using threshold detection for the key extraction, novel expressions for the secret key rate and quantum bit error rate for both one- and two-way protocols are derived. The performance gain with larger MIMO configurations and the tradeoff between the performances with the one- and the two-way protocols with respect to the transmission distance of the legitimate FSO link are numerically assessed.

Title: PySlyde: A Lightweight, Open-Source Toolkit for Pathology Preprocessing
Authors: Gregory Verghese, Anthony Baptista, Chima Eke, Holly Rafique, Mengyuan Li, Fathima Mohamed, Ananya Bhalla, Lucy Ryan, Michael Pitcher, Enrico Parisini, Concetta Piazzese, Liz Ing-Simmons, Anita Grigoriadis
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pathology is advancing precision medicine by improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight, open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and downstream analysis.

Title: Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability
Authors: Dhrumil Bhatt, Vidushi Kumar
Abstract: The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho = 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.

Title: Automatic segmentation of colorectal liver metastases for ultrasound-based navigated resection
Authors: Tiziano Natali, Karin A. Olthof, Niels F.M. Kok, Koert F.D. Kuhlmann, Theo J.M. Ruers, Matteo Fusaglia
Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast, noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows. Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use. Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC = 0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance. Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing manual workload and procedure time.

Title: Force-Safe Environment Maps and Real-Time Detection for Soft Robot Manipulators
Authors: Akua K. Dickson, Juan C. Pacheco Garcia, Andrew P. Sabelhaus
Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e. positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered environments.

Title: Learning Dynamics from Input-Output Data with Hamiltonian Gaussian Processes
Authors: Jan-Hendrik Ewering, Robin E. Herrmann, Niklas Wahlström, Thomas B. Schön, Thomas Seel
Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws, in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

Title: SAD-Flower: Flow Matching for Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically Consistent Planning
Authors: Tzu-Yuan Huang, Armin Lederer, Dai-Jie Wu, Xiaobing Dai, Sihua Zhang, Stefan Sosnowski, Shao-Hua Sun, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Title: ETHOS: A Robotic Encountered-Type Haptic Display for Social Interaction in Virtual Reality
Authors: Eric Godden, Jacquie Groenewegen, Matthew K.X.J. Pan
Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction), a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers, fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.

Title: Adversarially Robust Multitask Adaptive Control
Authors: Kasra Fallah, Leonardo F. Toso, James Anderson
Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within each cluster.

Title: The Less Intelligent the Elements, the More Intelligent the Whole. Or, Possibly Not?
Authors: Guido Fioretti
Abstract: The agent-based modelling community has a debate on how ``intelligent'' artificial agents should be, and in what ways their local intelligence relates to the emergence of a collective intelligence. I approach this debate by endowing the preys and predators of the Lotka-Volterra model with behavioral algorithms characterized by different levels of sophistication. The main finding is that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While this broadly confirms that, in general, relatively simple agents favor the emergence of complex collective behavior, it also suggests that one fundamental mechanism is that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behavior can allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.

Title: Comparative Study on Noise-Augmented Training and its Effect on Adversarial Robustness in ASR Systems
Authors: Karla Pizzi, Matías Pizarro, Asja Fischer
Abstract: In this study, we investigate whether noise-augmented training can concurrently improve adversarial robustness in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We conduct a comparative analysis of the adversarial robustness of four different ASR architectures, each trained under three different augmentation conditions: (1) background noise, speed variations, and reverberations; (2) speed variations only; (3) no data augmentation. We then evaluate the robustness of all resulting models against attacks with white-box or black-box adversarial examples. Our results demonstrate that noise augmentation not only enhances model performance on noisy speech but also improves the model's robustness to adversarial attacks.

Title: Pre-equalization Design for ISAC-OTFS Air-Ground Transmission: A Deep Learning Approach
Authors: Weihao Wang, Jing Guo, Siqiang Wang, Xinyi Wang, Weijie Yuan, Zesong Fei
Abstract: Despite the strong Doppler resilience capability, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation suffers from high channel estimation and equalization complexity at the receiver, hindering its applicability in air-ground transmission. In this paper, we propose a pre-equalization-based integrated sensing and communications-OTFS downlink transmission framework in which the terrestrial access point executes pre-equalization using the predicted channel state information (CSI), so that the unmanned aerial vehicle can perform direct symbol detection without channel equalization. In particular, the mean square error of OTFS symbol demodulation and Cramer-Rao lower bound of sensing parameter estimation are considered, with their weighted sum utilized as the metric for optimizing the pre-equalization matrix. To address the time-varying CSI, we develop a deep learning based framework composed of channel prediction and pre-equalization. In particular, a parameter-level channel prediction module is utilized to decouple OTFS channel parameters, and a low-dimensional prediction network is leveraged to correct outdated CSI, which is then used to initialize the input of the pre-equalization module. Finally, a dual-branch residual-structured deep neural network is cascaded to execute pre-equalization. Simulation results show that the proposed channel prediction-based pre-equalization framework significantly reduces receiver complexity and pilot overhead while achieving symbol detection performance close to minimum mean square error equalization with perfect CSI under high mobility, as well as substantially improving sensing accuracy.

Title: Analytical Models of Frequency and Voltage in Large-Scale All-Inverter Power Systems
Authors: Marena Trujillo, Amir Sajadi, Bri-Mathias Hodge
Abstract: Low-order frequency response models for power systems have a decades-long history in optimization and control problems such as unit commitment, economic dispatch, and wide-area control. With a few exceptions, these models are built upon the Newtonian mechanics of synchronous generators, assuming that the frequency dynamics across a system are approximately homogeneous, and assume the dynamics of nodal voltages for most operating conditions are negligible, and thus are not directly computed at all buses. As a result, the use of system frequency models results in the systematic underestimation of frequency minimum nadir and maximum RoCoF, and provides no insight into the reactive power-voltage dynamics. This paper proposes a low-order model of both frequency and voltage response in grid-forming inverter-dominated power systems. The proposed model accounts for spatial-temporal variations in frequency and voltage behavior across a system and as a result, demonstrates the heterogeneity of frequency response in future renewable power systems. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to validate the utility, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these models, setting the basis for them to serve as fast, scalable alternatives to EMT simulation, especially when dealing with very large-scale systems, for both planning and operational studies.

Title: Generative Autoregressive Transformers for Model-Agnostic Federated MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Valiyeh A. Nezhad, Gokberk Elmas, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Emine U. Saritas, Tolga Çukur
Abstract: While learning-based models hold great promise for MRI reconstruction, single-site models trained on limited local datasets often show poor generalization. This has motivated collaborative training across institutions via federated learning (FL)-a privacy-preserving framework that aggregates model updates instead of sharing raw data. Conventional FL requires architectural homogeneity, restricting sites from using models tailored to their resources or needs. To address this limitation, we propose FedGAT, a model-agnostic FL technique that first collaboratively trains a global generative prior for MR images, adapted from a natural image foundation model composed of a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a transformer that generates images via spatial-scale autoregression. We fine-tune the transformer module after injecting it with a lightweight site-specific prompting mechanism, keeping the VAE frozen, to efficiently adapt the model to multi-site MRI data. In a second tier, each site independently trains its preferred reconstruction model by augmenting local data with synthetic MRI data from other sites, generated by site-prompting the tuned prior. This decentralized augmentation improves generalization while preserving privacy. Experiments on multi-institutional datasets show that FedGAT outperforms state-of-the-art FL baselines in both within- and cross-site reconstruction performance under model-heterogeneous settings.

Title: Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM
Authors: Lapo Frascati, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.

Title: On multipolar magnetic anomaly detection: multipolar signal subspaces, an analytical orthonormal basis, multipolar truncature and detection performance
Authors: Clément Chenevas-Paule, Steeve Zozor, Laure-Line Rouve, Olivier J. J. Michel, Olivier Pinaud, Romain Kukla
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the magnetic anomaly detection problem which aims to find hidden ferromagnetic masses by estimating the weak perturbation they induce on local Earth's magnetic field. We consider classical detection schemes that rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor, and modeling of the source as a function of unknown parameters. As the usual spherical harmonic decomposition of the anomaly has to be truncated in practice, we study the signal vector subspaces induced by each multipole of the decomposition, proving they are not in direct sum, and discussing the impact it has on the choice of the truncation order. Further, to ease the detection strategy based on generalized likelihood ratio test, we rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical set of orthonormal functions (multipolar orthonormal basis functions) that spans the space of the noise-free measured signal. Finally, based on the subspace structure of the multipole vector spaces, we study the impact of the truncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential surparametrization, and the behaviour of the information criteria used to choose this order.

Title: Lossy Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Yiyang Peng, Hongyu Li, Zheyu Wu, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.

Title: Revisiting Power System Stabilizers with Increased Inverter-Based Generation: A Case Study
Authors: Jovan Krajacic, Keith Moffat, Gustavo Valverde
Abstract: As power systems evolve with increasing production from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), their underlying dynamics are undergoing significant changes that can jeopardize system operation, leading to poorly damped oscillations or small-signal rotor angle instability. In this work, we investigate whether Power System Stabilizer (PSS) setting adjustments can effectively restore system stability and provide adequate damping in systems with increased IBR penetration, using the benchmark Kundur Two-Area System as a case study. Specifically, we evaluate the model-based Residues and P-Vref PSS tuning methods to examine their effectiveness under evolving grid conditions. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these tuning methods is not guaranteed, particularly when coordination is limited. Consequently, our case study motivates local and adaptive online PSS tuning methods.

Title: Coordinated Control of Autonomous Vehicles for Traffic Density Reduction at a Signalized Junction: An MPC Approach
Authors: Rudra Sen, Subashish Datta
Abstract: The effective and safe management of traffic is a key issue due to the rapid advancement of the urban transportation system. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) possess the capability to connect with each other and adjacent infrastructure, presenting novel opportunities for enhancing traffic flow and coordination. This work proposes a dual-mode model predictive control (MPC) architecture that tackles two interrelated issues: mitigating traffic density at signalized junctions and facilitating seamless, cooperative lane changes in high-density traffic conditions. The objective of this work is to facilitate responsive decision-making for CAVs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of urban mobility. Moreover, we ensure recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed MPC scheme by the integration of an online-calculated maximal control invariant terminal set. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulation.

Title: Cyst-X: A Federated AI System Outperforms Clinical Guidelines to Detect Pancreatic Cancer Precursors and Reduce Unnecessary Surgery

Schoots, Marco J. Bruno, Chenchan Huang, Candice W. Bolan, Tamas Gonda, Frank H. Miller, Rajesh N. Keswani, Michael B. Wallace, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to be the second-deadliest cancer by 2030, making early detection critical. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key cancer precursors, present a clinical dilemma, as current guidelines struggle to stratify malignancy risk, leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed diagnoses. Here, we developed Cyst-X, an AI framework for IPMN risk prediction trained on a unique, multi-center dataset of 1,461 MRI scans from 764 patients. Cyst-X achieves significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.82) than both the established Kyoto guidelines (AUC = 0.75) and expert radiologists, particularly in correct identification of high-risk lesions. Clinically, this translates to a 20% increase in cancer detection sensitivity (87.8% vs. 64.1%) for high-risk lesions. We demonstrate that this performance is maintained in a federated learning setting, allowing for collaborative model training without compromising patient privacy. To accelerate research in early pancreatic cancer detection, we publicly release the Cyst-X dataset and models, providing the first large-scale, multi-center MRI resource for pancreatic cyst analysis.

Title: An overview of Koopman-based control: From error bounds to closed-loop guarantees
Authors: Robin Strässer, Karl Worthmann, Igor Mezić, Julian Berberich, Manuel Schaller, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear dynamical systems remains a central challenge in a wide range of applications, particularly when accurate first-principle models are unavailable. Data-driven approaches offer a promising alternative by designing controllers directly from observed trajectories. A wide range of data-driven methods relies on the Koopman-operator framework that enables linear representations of nonlinear dynamics via lifting into higher-dimensional observable spaces. Finite-dimensional approximations, such as extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and its controlled variants, make prediction and feedback control tractable but introduce approximation errors that must be accounted for to provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees. This survey provides a systematic overview of Koopman-based control, emphasizing the connection between data-driven surrogate models, approximation errors, controller design, and closed-loop guarantees. We review theoretical foundations, error bounds, and both linear and bilinear EDMD-based control schemes, highlighting robust strategies that ensure stability and performance. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions at the interface of operator theory, approximation theory, and nonlinear control.

Title: Communication-Efficient Collaborative LLM Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding
Authors: Ce Zheng, Tingting Yang
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is well-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end devices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing distributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary probability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model at the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme, where the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the corresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference performance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft length that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis of the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Statistical Inference for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar
Authors: Vinay Kulkarni, V. V. Reddy
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar systems offer high range resolution due to their wide bandwidth, enabling the detection of multiple spatially distributed scatterers from a single extended target, such as a vehicle. Traditional CFAR-based detection methods often treat these scatterers as independent point targets, thereby neglecting the inherent spatial structure of extended objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Range-Doppler (RD) segment-based statistical inference framework that captures the characteristic scattering profile of extended automotive targets. The framework employs Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for statistical parameter extraction and utilizes Gibbs sampling within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to model the posterior distribution of the segment features. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated distribution, is introduced for binary hypothesis testing to distinguish extended targets. Furthermore, we develop a detection pipeline incorporating Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics and peak-centric segment alignment, optimized for single-dwell radar operations. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in automotive radar scenarios.

Title: Bayesian Self-Calibration and Parametric Channel Estimation for 6G Antenna Arrays
Authors: Patrick Hödl, Jakob Möderl, Erik Leitinger, Klaus Witrisal
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric, demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.

Title: Soft Switching Expert Policies for Controlling Systems with Uncertain Parameters
Authors: Junya Ikemoto
Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While simulators are useful for safely learning control policies for physical systems, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Title: USF-MAE: Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Robin Ducharme, Aylin Erman, Mark Walker, Steven Hawken, Adrian D. C. Chan
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities, offering real-time, radiation-free assessment across diverse clinical domains. However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D (ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines, achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively. Despite not using labels during pretraining, USF-MAE approached the performance of the supervised foundation model UltraSam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on the other tasks, demonstrating strong cross-anatomical generalization.

Title: Predictive Compensation in Finite-Horizon LQ Games under Gauss-Markov Deviations
Authors: Navid Mojahed, Mahdis Rabbani, Shima Nazari
Abstract: This paper develops a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon, discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games subject to Gauss-Markov execution deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player's control is corrupted by temporally correlated stochastic perturbations modeled as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process, while the opposing player has causal access to past deviations and employs a predictive feedforward strategy that anticipates their future effect. We derive closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation under the resulting perturbed closed loop, establish boundedness and sensitivity properties of the equilibrium trajectory, and characterize the reduction in expected cost achieved by optimal predictive compensation. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate performance gains relative to nominal Nash feedback across a range of disturbance persistence levels.

Title: RNN(p) for Power Consumption Forecasting
Authors: Roberto Baviera, Pietro Manzoni
Abstract: An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.

Title: Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose Theorem
Authors: Shaan Ul Haque, Siva Theja Maguluri
Abstract: Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA). Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.

Title: Preserving Speaker Information in Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Non-Autoregressive Generation and Pretraining
Authors: Rui Zhou, Akinori Ito, Takashi Nose
Abstract: Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) refers to the conversion of speech in one language into semantically equivalent speech in another language, facilitating communication between speakers of different languages. Speech-to-Discrete Unit Translation (S2UT), a mainstream approach for end-to-end S2ST, addresses challenges such as error propagation across modules and slow inference speed often encountered in traditional cascade systems. However, as discrete units primarily capture content information, conventional S2UT methods fail to retain speaker-specific characteristics from the source. Our previous work, SC-S2UT, introduced a speaker adapter and a unit-to-mel structure, enabling the preservation of speaker information and non-autoregressive speech generation. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a self-supervised pretraining method to enrich the information extracted by both the speaker adapter and the unit-to-mel structure. Additionally, we investigate different feature fusion strategies to further improve the integration of speaker and content features. Experiments conducted on the CVSS-T dataset for ES-EN and FR-EN tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a BLEU score improvement of 1.14 compared to SC-S2UT, along with significant enhancements in MOS and speaker similarity. Furthermore, our approach achieves translation quality comparable to traditional S2UT, with only a minimal increase of 0.04s per utterance in inference time, while maintaining high speaker similarity. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Robust targeted exploration for systems with non-stochastic disturbances
Authors: Janani Venkatasubramanian, Johannes Köhler, Mark Cannon, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted exploration strategy designed specifically for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with energy-bounded disturbances, i.e., without making any assumptions on the distribution of the disturbances. We use classical results characterizing the set of non-falsified parameters consistent with energy-bounded disturbances. We derive a semidefinite program which computes an exploration strategy that guarantees a desired accuracy of the parameter estimate. This design is based on sufficient conditions on the spectral content of the exploration data that robustly account for initial parametric uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the applicability of the exploration strategy through a numerical example involving a nonlinear system.

Title: Joint Bundle Design and Pricing for Extended Warranty Providers Servicing Multi-Tier Products
Authors: Yajing Chen, Yanrong Li, Xiao-Lin Wang, Zhi-Sheng Ye
Abstract: Extended warranties (EWs) constitute a significant source of revenue for capital-intensive products. Such products comprise multiple subsystems, enabling flexible EW design. For example, providers can bundle tailored sets of subsystems within different EW contracts, facilitating the creation of a service menu with differentiated warranty options. From the perspective of a third-party EW provider servicing multi-tier products, we develop a novel model to jointly optimize bundle design and pricing for EW options in order to maximize the expected total profit. Specifically, the problem involves determining which contracts-each containing a differentiated bundle of subsystems-to recommend for the multi-tier products and identifying the appropriate price for each contract. As the complexity of the joint optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of subsystems, we devise two solution approaches. The first approach leverages a mixed-integer second-order cone programming reformulation, which guarantees optimality but is applicable only for a small number of subsystems. The second approach utilizes an iterative two-step process, offering enhanced computational efficiency for scenarios involving a large number of subsystems. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our model, particularly in scenarios characterized by high failure probabilities and a large number of subsystems.

Title: LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols
Authors: Ziming Liu, Bryan Liu, Alvaro Valcarce, Xiaoli Chu
Abstract: Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question--answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request--response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).

Title: Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem
Authors: Brycen D. Pearl, Joseph M. Miller, Hang Woon Lee
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOSs) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOSs, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOSs are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.

Title: To Trust or Not to Trust: On Calibration in ML-based Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks
Authors: Rashika Raina, Nidhi Simmons, David E. Simmons, Michel Daoud Yacoub, Trung Q. Duong
Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.

Title: Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction
Authors: Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering and Applied Sciences (UEAS), Swat, Pakistan)
Abstract: Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.
