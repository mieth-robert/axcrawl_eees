Title: MRADNET: a Compact Radar Object Detector with MetaFormer
Authors: Huaiyu Chen, Fahed Hassanat, Robert Laganiere, Martin Bouchard
Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design of the model. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Underground Multi-robot Systems at Work: a revolution in mining
Authors: Victor V. Puche, Kashish Verma, Matteo Fumagalli
Abstract: The growing global demand for critical raw materials (CRMs) has highlighted the need to access difficult and hazardous environments such as abandoned underground mines. These sites pose significant challenges for conventional machinery and human operators due to confined spaces, structural instability, and lack of infrastructure. To address this, we propose a modular multi-robot system designed for autonomous operation in such environments, enabling sequential mineral extraction tasks. Unlike existing work that focuses primarily on mapping and inspection through global behavior or central control, our approach incorporates physical interaction capabilities using specialized robots coordinated through local high-level behavior control. Our proposed system utilizes Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) behaviors to structure complex task execution across heterogeneous robotic platforms. Each robot has its own HFSM behavior to perform sequential autonomy while maintaining overall system coordination, achieved by triggering behavior execution through inter-robot communication. This architecture effectively integrates software and hardware components to support collaborative, task-driven multi-robot operation in confined underground environments.

Title: Learning in Stackelberg Markov Games
Authors: Jun He, Andrew L. Liu, Yihsu Chen
Abstract: Designing socially optimal policies in multi-agent environments is a fundamental challenge in both economics and artificial intelligence. This paper studies a general framework for learning Stackelberg equilibria in dynamic and uncertain environments, where a single leader interacts with a population of adaptive followers. Motivated by pressing real-world challenges such as equitable electricity tariff design for consumers with distributed energy resources (such as rooftop solar and energy storage), we formalize a class of Stackelberg Markov games and establish the existence and uniqueness of stationary Stackelberg equilibria under mild continuity and monotonicity conditions. We then extend the framework to incorporate a continuum of agents via mean-field approximation, yielding a tractable Stackelberg-Mean Field Equilibrium (S-MFE) formulation. To address the computational intractability of exact best-response dynamics, we introduce a softmax-based approximation and rigorously bound its error relative to the true Stackelberg equilibrium. Our approach enables scalable and stable learning through policy iteration without requiring full knowledge of follower objectives. We validate the framework on an energy market simulation, where a public utility or a state utility commission sets time-varying rates for a heterogeneous population of prosumers. Our results demonstrate that learned policies can simultaneously achieve economic efficiency, equity across income groups, and stability in energy systems. This work demonstrates how game-theoretic learning frameworks can support data-driven policy design in large-scale strategic environments, with applications to real-world systems like energy markets.

Title: Investigating Polyglot Speech Foundation Models for Learning Collective Emotion from Crowds
Authors: Orchid Chetia Phukan, Girish, Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Panchal Nayak, Priyabrata Mallick, Swarup Ranjan Behera, Parabattina Bhagath, Pailla Balakrishna Reddy, Arun Balaji Buduru
Abstract: This paper investigates the polyglot (multilingual) speech foundation models (SFMs) for Crowd Emotion Recognition (CER). We hypothesize that polyglot SFMs, pre-trained on diverse languages, accents, and speech patterns, are particularly adept at navigating the noisy and complex acoustic environments characteristic of crowd settings, thereby offering a significant advantage for CER. To substantiate this, we perform a comprehensive analysis, comparing polyglot, monolingual, and speaker recognition SFMs through extensive experiments on a benchmark CER dataset across varying audio durations (1 sec, 500 ms, and 250 ms). The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of polyglot SFMs, outperforming their counterparts across all audio lengths and excelling even with extremely short-duration inputs. These findings pave the way for adaptation of SFMs in setting up new benchmarks for CER.

Title: Similarity-Guided Diffusion for Long-Gap Music Inpainting
Authors: Sean Turland, Eloi Moliner, Vesa Välimäki
Abstract: Music inpainting aims to reconstruct missing segments of a corrupted recording. While diffusion-based generative models improve reconstruction for medium-length gaps, they often struggle to preserve musical plausibility over multi-second gaps. We introduce Similarity-Guided Diffusion Posterior Sampling (SimDPS), a hybrid method that combines diffusion-based inference with similarity search. Candidate segments are first retrieved from a corpus based on contextual similarity, then incorporated into a modified likelihood that guides the diffusion process toward contextually consistent reconstructions. Subjective evaluation on piano music inpainting with 2-s gaps shows that the proposed SimDPS method enhances perceptual plausibility compared to unguided diffusion and frequently outperforms similarity search alone when moderately similar candidates are available. These results demonstrate the potential of a hybrid similarity approach for diffusion-based audio enhancement with long gaps.

Title: Sound field estimation with moving microphones using kernel ridge regression
Authors: Jesper Brunnström, Martin Bo Møller, Jan Østergaard, Shoichi Koyama, Toon van Waterschoot, Marc Moonen
Abstract: Sound field estimation with moving microphones can increase flexibility, decrease measurement time, and reduce equipment constraints compared to using stationary microphones. In this paper a sound field estimation method based on kernel ridge regression (KRR) is proposed for moving microphones. The proposed KRR method is constructed using a discrete time continuous space sound field model based on the discrete Fourier transform and the Herglotz wave function. The proposed method allows for the inclusion of prior knowledge as a regularization penalty, similar to kernel-based methods with stationary microphones, which is novel for moving microphones. Using a directional weighting for the proposed method, the sound field estimates are improved, which is demonstrated on both simulated and real data. Due to the high computational cost of sound field estimation with moving microphones, an approximate KRR method is proposed, using random Fourier features (RFF) to approximate the kernel. The RFF method is shown to decrease computational cost while obtaining less accurate estimates compared to KRR, providing a trade-off between cost and performance.

Title: Power Spectral Density Estimation via Universal Truncated Order Statistics Filtering
Authors: David Campos Anchieta, John R. Buck
Abstract: Loud transient signals in underwater acoustic data increase the bias and variance of background noise power spectral density (PSD) estimates based on sample mean. Recently, two PSD estimators mitigated the loud transient impact on PSD estimates by applying order statistics filtering (OSF). The first, the Schwock and Abadi Welch Percentile, scales a single rank order statistic (OS) of consecutive periodograms. The second, the truncated linear order statistics filter, is a weighted sum of OS up to a chosen rank. In order to minimize variance, both OSFs must carefully choose the highest rank that still eliminates the loud transients. However, in real-time applications in dynamic environments, loud transients occur at unpredictable rates, requiring dynamic adjustment of the OSF ranks to keep low bias and variance. To circumvent the challenges of real-time rank selection, this paper proposes a convex sum of OSFs across ranks with blending weights that are sequentially adjusted to favor the lowest variance OSFs over a recent time window. The performance of the blended sum provably approaches the performance of the best fixed rank OSF. Simulations and real data confirm the blended OSFs effectively filter loud transients out of spectrograms without explicitly choosing a threshold rank.

Title: Servos for Local Map Exploration Onboard Nonholonomic Vehicles for Extremum Seeking
Authors: Dylan James-Kavanaugh, Patrick McNamee, Qixu Wang, Zahra Nili Ahmadabadi
Abstract: Extremum seeking control (ESC) often employs perturbation-based estimates of derivatives for some sensor field or cost function. These estimates are generally obtained by simply multiplying the output of a single-unit sensor by some time-varying function. Previous work has focused on sinusoidal perturbations to generate derivative estimates with results for arbitrary order derivatives of scalar maps or higher up to third-order derivatives of multivariable maps. This work extends the perturbations from sinusoidal to bounded periodic or almost periodic functions and considers multivariable maps. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for determining if time-varying functions exist for estimating arbitrary order derivatives of multivariable maps for any given bounded periodic or almost periodic dither signal. These results are then used in a source seeking controller for a nonholonomic vehicle with a sensor actuated by servo. The conducted simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that by distributing the local map exploration to a servo, the nonholonomic vehicle was able to achieve a faster convergence to the source.

Title: Hybrid FIM and STAR-BD-RIS-Aided Wireless Communications with Short Packet Length: A Meta-TD3 Approach
Authors: Ayla Eftekhari, Maryam Cheraghy, Armin Farhadi, Mohammad Robat Mili, Qingqing Wu
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIM) have been widely adopted in multi-user wireless communication systems to enhance channel quality through simultaneous transmission and reflection of signals and three-dimensional reconfiguration of antennas. In this paper, we propose a novel system architecture that integrates the benefits of both technologies by deploying an FIM antenna at the base station (BS) and a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting beyond diagonal RIS (STAR-BD-RIS) along the transmission path to ensure sufficient received power for single-antenna users. The objective is to maximize the achievable sum rate considering the short block length by jointly optimizing the FIM surface configuration, the transmit beamforming vector, and STAR-BD-RIS phase shift matrix subject to practical constraints including minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), power limitations, FIM constraint, and the STAR-BD-RIS phase-shift matrix. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we develop a learning-based approach that incorporates meta-learning into the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, referred to as Meta-TD3. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid system outperforms conventional configurations employing either FIM or RIS alone, while the Meta-TD3 algorithm achieves superior performance compared to classic learning techniques.

Title: Harmonic Summation-Based Robust Pitch Estimation in Noisy and Reverberant Environments
Authors: Anup Singh, Kris Demuynck
Abstract: Accurate pitch estimation is essential for numerous speech processing applications, yet it remains challenging in high-distortion environments. This paper proposes a robust pitch estimation method that delivers robust pitch estimates in challenging noise environments. Our approach computes the Normalized Average Magnitude Difference Function (NAMDF), transforms it into a likelihood function, and generates probabilistic pitch states for frames at each sample shift. To enhance noise robustness, we aggregate likelihood values across integer multiples of the pitch period and neighboring frames. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective continuity constraint in the Viterbi algorithm to refine pitch selection among multiple candidates. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves lower Gross Pitch Error (GPE) and Voicing Decision Error (VDE) across various SNR levels, outperforming existing methods in both noisy and reverberant conditions.

Title: TF-CorrNet: Leveraging Spatial Correlation for Continuous Speech Separation
Authors: Ui-Hyeop Shin, Bon Hyeok Ku, Hyung-Min Park
Abstract: In general, multi-channel source separation has utilized inter-microphone phase differences (IPDs) concatenated with magnitude information in time-frequency domain, or real and imaginary components stacked along the channel axis. However, the spatial information of a sound source is fundamentally contained in the differences between microphones, specifically in the correlation between them, while the power of each microphone also provides valuable information about the source spectrum, which is why the magnitude is also included. Therefore, we propose a network that directly leverages a correlation input with phase transform (PHAT)-beta to estimate the separation filter. In addition, the proposed TF-CorrNet processes the features alternately across time and frequency axes as a dual-path strategy in terms of spatial information. Furthermore, we add a spectral module to model source-related direct time-frequency patterns for improved speech separation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TF-CorrNet effectively separates the speech sounds, showing high performance with a low computational cost in the LibriCSS dataset.

Title: Synergies between Federated Foundation Models and Smart Power Grids
Authors: Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Shimiao Li, Adedoyin Inaolaji, Filippo Malandra, Luis Herrera, Nicholas Mastronarde
Abstract: The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 has marked a significant paradigm shift in machine learning. Trained on massive corpora of data, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, summarization, and reasoning, transforming how intelligent systems process and interact with human language. Although LLMs may still seem like a recent breakthrough, the field is already witnessing the rise of a new and more general category: multi-modal, multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs). These models go beyond language and can process heterogeneous data types/modalities, such as time-series measurements, audio, imagery, tabular records, and unstructured logs, while supporting a broad range of downstream tasks spanning forecasting, classification, control, and retrieval. When combined with federated learning (FL), they give rise to M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs): a highly recent and largely unexplored class of models that enable scalable, privacy-preserving model training/fine-tuning across distributed data sources. In this paper, we take one of the first steps toward introducing these models to the power systems research community by offering a bidirectional perspective: (i) M3T FedFMs for smart grids and (ii) smart grids for FedFMs. In the former, we explore how M3T FedFMs can enhance key grid functions, such as load/demand forecasting and fault detection, by learning from distributed, heterogeneous data available at the grid edge in a privacy-preserving manner. In the latter, we investigate how the constraints and structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory dimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs.

Title: Advancing Accessible Hand-Arm Vibration Safety Monitoring: ISO-Compliance with Wearable Sensors and Transfer Functions
Authors: Johannes Mootz, Reza Akhavian
Abstract: Field workers are frequently exposed to hazardous vibrations, increasing the risk of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and other long-term health problems. ISO 5349-1 provides guidelines for measuring vibration exposure. However, this standard was established in controlled conditions using high-quality accelerometers directly attached to power tool handles. This study investigates an alternative, wearable sensor-based data collection process and develops an error-minimization transfer function that derives values comparable to ISO benchmarks for safety monitoring. Experiments are performed with subjects hammer drilling into concrete while vibrations are measured using three accelerometers at different sampling frequencies. The transfer function maps vibration data across sensor positions by accounting for damping effects. The findings indicate a significant reduction in acceleration between the palm and upper arm, highlight the impact of sampling frequency on data accuracy, and enable accurate comparison of true hand-arm vibration levels with existing standard limits to allow accessible, real-time, and cost-effective HAVS prevention.

Title: Bearing-only Tracking using Towed Sensor-Array with Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise Statistics
Authors: Rohit Kumar Singh, Subrata Kumar, Shovan Bhaumik
Abstract: Passive bearing-only tracking (BOT) estimates the target states by utilising noisy bearing measurements captured by a sensor array. The sensor array is often towed behind the ship, using a long flexible cable to reduce interference from the own-ship's inherent noises. This forms a towed cable sensor-array system (TCSAS). During BOT, the tow-ship has to perform a manoeuvre to make the tracking system observable. Such a manoeuvre destabilises the TCSAS, thus making its exact location unknown \emph{w.r.t.} tow-ship. However, it is very crucial to know the exact location of the towed sensor-array to perform efficient and reliable target state estimation. The existing BOT approaches perform TMA during own-ship manoeuvre either by pausing the measurement updation step of the estimation algorithm or assuming a fixed aft position for the towed sensor-array. These assumptions lead to unreliable state estimation. To address this, we propose a dynamic model for TCSAS, using a lumped mass approach, which will provide the location of the sensor array during the own-ship manoeuvre. This location will be fed to the state estimation algorithm. The dynamic of TCSAS in 3D space is obtained by solving the equations obtained from the moment balance condition and quasi-static equilibrium condition at the lumped mass points. Moreover, the bearing data captured by the towed sensor-array is corrupted with non-Gaussian noise. It is handled using the maximum correntropy criterion based Kalman filter with a kernel bandwidth selection technique, proposed in this paper. The proposed sensor-array dynamic model is verified for a real-world BOT engagement scenario.

Title: Fusing Spectral Correlation Density Imaging with Deep Learning for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis in Rotating Machinery
Authors: Dilshara Herath, Chinthaka Abeyrathne, Chamindu Adithya, Chathura Seneviratne
Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery is critical for ensuring operational reliability, therefore early fault detection is essential to avoid catastrophic failures and expensive emergency repairs. Traditional methods like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) often fail to capture the complex, non-stationary nature of vibration signals. This study leverages the cyclostationary properties of vibration data through Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) images to enhance fault detection and apply deep learning for classification. Using a publicly available dataset with bearing faults seeded in two distinct housings (A and B) under varying load conditions (0 Nm, 2 Nm, 4 Nm), we processed vibration signals into 2D SCD images to reveal fault-specific periodicities, such as broadband spectra (2000--8000 Hz) for larger faults. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, Custom CNN, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetB0, were developed to classify seven bearing conditions. The custom CNN achieved the highest accuracies of 96.58\% and 94.95\% on Housing A and B, respectively, followed by ResNet152V2 at 96.49\% and 95.35\%, and EfficientNetB0 at 94.16\% and 91.65\%, respectively. The models' high accuracies across different housings demonstrate a robust solution suitable for cost-effective condition monitoring deployable near sensing platforms, contributing to applied machine learning for edge intelligence and showcasing effective signal processing strategies for handling complex, potentially large-scale vibration data.

Title: Robust Sparse Subspace Tracking from Corrupted Data Observations
Authors: Ta Giang Thuy Loan, Hoang-Lan Nguyen, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Lan, Do Hai Son, Tran Thi Thuy Quynh, Nguyen Linh Trung, Karim Abed-Meraim, Thanh Trung Le
Abstract: Subspace tracking is a fundamental problem in signal processing, where the goal is to estimate and track the underlying subspace that spans a sequence of data streams over time. In high-dimensional settings, data samples are often corrupted by non-Gaussian noises and may exhibit sparsity. This paper explores the alpha divergence for sparse subspace estimation and tracking, offering robustness to data corruption. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art robust subspace tracking methods while achieving a low computational complexity and memory storage. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness in robust subspace tracking and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation.

Title: An Octave-based Multi-Resolution CQT Architecture for Diffusion-based Audio Generation
Authors: Maurício do V. M. da Costa, Eloi Moliner
Abstract: This paper introduces MR-CQTdiff, a novel neural-network architecture for diffusion-based audio generation that leverages a multi-resolution Constant-$Q$ Transform (C$Q$T). The proposed architecture employs an efficient, invertible CQT framework that adjusts the time-frequency resolution on an octave-by-octave basis. This design addresses the issue of low temporal resolution at lower frequencies, enabling more flexible and expressive audio generation. We conduct an evaluation using the Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) metric across various architectures and two datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MR-CQTdiff achieves state-of-the-art audio quality, outperforming competing architectures.

Title: Audio-Conditioned Diffusion LLMs for ASR and Deliberation Processing
Authors: Mengqi Wang, Zhan Liu, Zengrui Jin, Guangzhi Sun, Chao Zhang, Philip C. Woodland
Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have recently attracted growing interest as an alternative to autoregressive decoders. In this work, we present an empirical study on using the diffusion-based large language model LLaDA for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first investigate its use as an external deliberation-based processing module for Whisper-LLaMA transcripts. By leveraging the bidirectional attention and denoising capabilities of LLaDA, we explore random masking, low-confidence masking, and semi-autoregressive strategies, showing that Whisper-LLaDA substantially reduces WER compared with the baseline. On LibriSpeech, the best cascade system achieves 2.25%/4.94% WER on test-clean/test-other, representing a 12.3% relative improvement over the Whisper-LLaMA baseline on the test-other split. In contrast, a plain-text LLaDA without acoustic features fails to improve accuracy, highlighting the importance of audio-conditioned embeddings. We further evaluate Whisper-LLaDA as a standalone decoder for ASR with diffusion-based and semi-autoregressive decoding. Most experimental configurations achieve faster inference than the Whisper-LLaMA baseline, although recognition accuracy is slightly lower. These findings offer an empirical view of diffusion-based LLMs for ASR and point to promising directions for improvements.

Title: A LiDAR-Driven Fallback Longitudinal Controller for Safer Following in Sudden Braking Scenarios
Authors: Mohamed Sabry, Enrico Del Re, Walter Morales-Alvarez, Cristina Olaverri-Monreal
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control has seen significant advancements, with Collaborative Adaptive Cruise Control leveraging Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication to enhance coordination and stability. However, the reliance on stable communication channels limits its reliability. Research on reducing information dependencies in Adaptive Cruise Control systems has remained limited, despite its critical role in mitigating collision risks during sudden braking scenarios. This study proposes a novel fallback longitudinal controller that relies solely on LiDAR-based distance measurements and the velocity of a follower vehicle. The controller is designed to be time-independent, ensuring operation in the presence of sensor delays or synchronization issues. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller enables vehicle-following from standstill and prevents collisions during emergency braking, even under minimal onboard information.

Title: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Communication and Channel Sounding: Requirements, Challenges, and Key Technologies
Authors: Yu Zhou, Chao Zou, Nanhao Zhou, Yanqun Tang, Xiaoying Zhang, Haoran Yin, Xiaoran Liu, Ruisi He, Pan Tang, Weijie Yuan, Yong Zeng
Abstract: Channel models are crucial for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation, and deployment of wireless communication systems. Traditional channel sounding systems are insufficient for handling the dynamic changes of channels in the next-generation space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSIN), which often results in outdated channel models that fail to provide reliable prior information for communication systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated channel sounding and communication (ICSC) method as a practical solution. Unlike orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a full delay-Doppler representation of the channel, achieving optimal diversity in time-frequency doubly dispersive channels and effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges. Thus, we investigate the fundamental principles of AFDM, showing how it enables simultaneous communication and channel sounding, and explore key performance metrics for both functionalities. We also clarify the distinction and relationship between channel sounding, estimation, tracking and scatterer sensing. Additionally, several potential application scenarios for AFDM-ICSC are explored. Finally, we highlight the key challenges in implementing AFDM-ICSC, outline future research directions, and provide valuable insights for the continued development of this technology.

Title: Safe Guaranteed Dynamics Exploration with Probabilistic Models
Authors: Manish Prajapat, Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Andreas Krause
Abstract: Ensuring both optimality and safety is critical for the real-world deployment of agents, but becomes particularly challenging when the system dynamics are unknown. To address this problem, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning via sufficient exploration in the space of safe policies. We propose a $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe framework that $\textit{optimistically}$ explores informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.

Title: Efficiently Computing the Cyclic Output-to-Output Gain
Authors: Daniel Arnström, André M.H. Teixeira
Abstract: The cyclic output-to-output gain is a security metric for control systems. Commonly, it is computed by solving a semi-definite program, which scales badly and inhibits its use for large-scale systems. We propose a method for computing the cyclic output-to-output gain using Hamiltonian matrices, similar to existing methods for the $H_\infty$-norm. In contrast to existing methods for the $H_{\infty}$-norm, the proposed method considers generalized singular values rather than regular singular values. Moreover, to ensure that the Hamiltonian matrices exist, we introduce a regularized version of the cyclic output-to-output gain. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method is more efficient, scalable, and reliable than semi-definite programming approaches.

Title: Near-Field Channel Estimation with ELAA Modular Arrays Under Hardware Impairments
Authors: Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) enable high spatial resolution and multiplexing, especially for user equipments (UEs) in the radiative near-field. To reduce hardware cost, modular ELAA architectures with distributed baseband units (BBUs) are gaining traction. This paper addresses near-field line-of-sight (LOS) channel estimation under low noise amplifier (LNA)-induced hardware impairments in such modular systems. We propose computationally efficient estimators that exploit the array geometry and constant-modulus structure of near-field LOS channels, including a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) masking technique that improves estimation accuracy and significantly reduces fronthaul signaling. Numerical results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the conventional least squares (LS) method.

Title: 6DMA-Assisted Secure Wireless Communications
Authors: Yanzhi Qian, Jing Jiang, Jingze Ding, Xiaoshao Dan, Hongyun Chu
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been widely studied for capacity enhancement, but its potential for physical layer security (PLS) remains largely unexplored. By adjusting both three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces, 6DMA can increase spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The extra DoFs enable dynamic shaping of legitimate channels and suppresses eavesdropping channels, thereby offering unique advantages in enhancing secrecy performance. Motivated by this, this letter proposes a novel 6DMA-assisted secure wireless communication system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with 6DMA to enhance secrecy performance. Specifically, to simultaneously serve multiple legitimate users and counter cooperative interception by multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum secrecy rate (SSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit and artificial noise (AN) beamformers, as well as the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems and solves them iteratively to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior secrecy performance over partially movable and conventional fixed-position antenna systems.

Title: Reverse Attention for Lightweight Speech Enhancement on Edge Devices
Authors: Shuubham Ojha, Felix Gervits, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight deep learning model for real-time speech enhancement, designed to operate efficiently on resource-constrained devices. The proposed model leverages a compact architecture that facilitates rapid inference without compromising performance. Key contributions include infusing soft attention-based attention gates in the U-Net architecture which is known to perform well for segmentation tasks and is optimized for GPUs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the model achieves competitive speech quality and intelligibility metrics, such as PESQ and Word Error Rates (WER), improving the performance of similarly sized baseline models. We are able to achieve a 6.24% WER improvement and a 0.64 PESQ score improvement over un-enhanced waveforms.

Title: A Multi-Grid Implicit Neural Representation for Multi-View Videos
Authors: Qingyue Ling, Zhengxue Cheng, Donghui Feng, Shen Wang, Chen Zhu, Guo Lu, Heming Sun, Jiro Katto, Li Song
Abstract: Multi-view videos are becoming widely used in different fields, but their high resolution and multi-camera shooting raise significant challenges for storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose MV-MGINR, a multi-grid implicit neural representation for multi-view videos. It combines a time-indexed grid, a view-indexed grid and an integrated time and view grid. The first two grids capture common representative contents across each view and time axis respectively, and the latter one captures local details under specific view and time. Then, a synthesis net is used to upsample the multi-grid latents and generate reconstructed frames. Additionally, a motion-aware loss is introduced to enhance the reconstruction quality of moving regions. The proposed framework effectively integrates the common and local features of multi-view videos, ultimately achieving high-quality reconstruction. Compared with MPEG immersive video test model TMIV, MV-MGINR achieves bitrate savings of 72.3% while maintaining the same PSNR.

Title: QASTAnet: A DNN-based Quality Metric for Spatial Audio
Authors: Adrien Llave, Emma Granier, Grégory Pallone
Abstract: In the development of spatial audio technologies, reliable and shared methods for evaluating audio quality are essential. Listening tests are currently the standard but remain costly in terms of time and resources. Several models predicting subjective scores have been proposed, but they do not generalize well to real-world signals. In this paper, we propose QASTAnet (Quality Assessment for SpaTial Audio network), a new metric based on a deep neural network, specialized on spatial audio (ambisonics and binaural). As training data is scarce, we aim for the model to be trainable with a small amount of data. To do so, we propose to rely on expert modeling of the low-level auditory system and use a neurnal network to model the high-level cognitive function of the quality judgement. We compare its performance to two reference metrics on a wide range of content types (speech, music, ambiance, anechoic, reverberated) and focusing on codec artifacts. Results demonstrate that QASTAnet overcomes the aforementioned limitations of the existing methods. The strong correlation between the proposed metric prediction and subjective scores makes it a good candidate for comparing codecs in their development.

Title: Data-Driven Observer Synthesis for Autonomous Limit Cycle Systems through Estimation of Koopman Eigenfunctions
Authors: Angela Ni, Wentao Tang
Abstract: The signal of system states needed for feedback controllers is estimated by state observers. One state observer design is the Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observer, a generalization of the Luenberger observer for linear systems. The main challenge in applying the KKL design is constructing an injective mapping of the states, which requires solving PDEs based on a first-principles model. This paper proposes a data-driven, Koopman operator-based method for the construction of KKL observers for planar limit cycle systems. Specifically, for such systems, the KKL injective mapping is guaranteed to be a linear combination of Koopman eigenfunctions. Hence, the determination of such an injection is reduced to a least-squares regression problem, and the inverse of the injective mapping is then approximated using kernel ridge regression. The entire synthesis procedure uses solely convex optimization. We apply the proposed approach to the Brusselator system, demonstrating accurate estimations of the system states.

Title: On the System Theoretic Offline Learning of Continuous-Time LQR with Exogenous Disturbances
Authors: Sayak Mukherjee, Ramij R. Hossain, Mahantesh Halappanavar
Abstract: We analyze offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies with uncertain disturbances. First, we consider the scenario where the exogenous variable can be estimated in a controlled environment, and subsequently, consider a more practical and challenging scenario where it is unknown in a stochastic setting. Our approach builds on the fundamental learning-based framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), combined with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to design the algorithms and derive sample-based approximations motivated from the Markov decision process (MDP)-based approaches. For the scenario involving non-measurable disturbances, we further establish stability and convergence guarantees for the learned control gains under sample-based approximations. The overall methodology emphasizes simplicity while providing rigorous guarantees. Finally, numerical experiments focus on the intricacies and validations for the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances.

Title: Feature Selection via Graph Topology Inference for Soundscape Emotion Recognition
Authors: Samuel Rey, Luca Martino, Roberto San Millan, Eduardo Morgado
Abstract: Research on soundscapes has shifted the focus of environmental acoustics from noise levels to the perception of sounds, incorporating contextual factors. Soundscape emotion recognition (SER) models perception using a set of features, with arousal and valence commonly regarded as sufficient descriptors of affect. In this work, we blend \emph{graph learning} techniques with a novel \emph{information criterion} to develop a feature selection framework for SER. Specifically, we estimate a sparse graph representation of feature relations using linear structural equation models (SEM) tailored to the widely used Emo-Soundscapes dataset. The resulting graph captures the relations between input features and the two emotional outputs. To determine the appropriate level of sparsity, we propose a novel \emph{generalized elbow detector}, which provides both a point estimate and an uncertainty interval. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our methods, including visualizations of the inferred relations. While several of our findings align with previous studies, the graph representation also reveals a strong connection between arousal and valence, challenging common SER assumptions.

Title: Data-Driven Two-Stage IRS-Aided Sumrate Maximization with Inexact Precoding
Authors: Hassaan Hashmi, Spyridon Pougkakiotis, Dionysis Kalogerias
Abstract: We propose iZoSGA, a data-driven learning algorithm for joint passive long-term intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-aided beamforming and active short-term precoding in wireless networks. iZoSGA is based on a zeroth-order stochastic quasigradient ascent methodology designed for tackling two-stage nonconvex stochastic programs with continuous uncertainty and objective functions with "black-box" terms, and where second-stage optimization is inexact. As such, iZoSGA utilizes inexact precoding oracles, enabling practical implementation when short-term (e.g., WMMSE-based) beamforming is solved approximately. The proposed method is agnostic to channel models or statistics, and applies to arbitrary IRS/network configurations. We prove non-asymptotic convergence of iZoSGA to a neighborhood of a stationary solution of the original exact problem under minimal assumptions. Our numerics confirm the efficacy iZoSGA in several "inexact regimes", enabling passive yet fully effective IRS operation in diverse and realistic IRS-aided scenarios.

Title: A model free approach for continuous-time optimal tracking control with unknown user-define cost and constrained control input via advantage function
Authors: Duc Cuong Nguyen, Quang Huy Dao, Phuong Nam Dao
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering approach to solving the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) and linear quadratic tracking (LQT) problems with constrained inputs using a novel off-policy continuous-time Q-learning framework. The proposed methodology leverages a novel concept of the Advantage function for linear continuous systems, enabling solutions to be obtained without the need for prior knowledge of the reward matrix weights, state resetting, or assuming the existence of a predefined admissible controller. This framework includes multiple algorithms (Algs) tailored to address these control problems under model-free conditions, without requiring any knowledge about system dynamics. Two distinct implementation methods are explored: the first processes state and input data over a fixed time interval, making it well-suited for LQR problems, while the second method operates over multiple intervals, offering a practical solution for tracking problems with constrained inputs. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is verified theoretically. Finally, the simulation results of the F-16 aircraft system are presented for the two problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Robustly Constrained Dynamic Games for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Shuyu Zhan, Chih-Yuan Chiu, Antoine P. Leeman, Glen Chou
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for robust dynamic games with nonlinear dynamics corrupted by state-dependent additive noise, and nonlinear agent-specific and shared constraints. Leveraging system-level synthesis (SLS), each agent designs a nominal trajectory and a causal affine error feedback law to minimize their own cost while ensuring that its own constraints and the shared constraints are satisfied, even under worst-case noise realizations. Building on these nonlinear safety certificates, we define the novel notion of a robustly constrained Nash equilibrium (RCNE). We then present an Iterative Best Response (IBR)-based algorithm that iteratively refines the optimal trajectory and controller for each agent until approximate convergence to the RCNE. We evaluated our method on simulations and hardware experiments involving large numbers of robots with high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, as well as state-dependent dynamics noise. Across all experiment settings, our method generated trajectory rollouts which robustly avoid collisions, while a baseline game-theoretic algorithm for producing open-loop motion plans failed to generate trajectories that satisfy constraints.

Title: Prescribed-Time Observer Is Naturally Robust Against Disturbances and Uncertainties
Authors: Abedou Abdelhadi, Mameche Omar
Abstract: This paper addresses the robustness of a prescribed-time observer for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. It is proven and demonstrated through simulations that the proposed observer completely rejects the effects of arbitrarily large bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, enabling accurate estimation of both the states and the disturbances. Furthermore, a comparison with the standard high-gain observer is provided to highlight the superiority of the prescribed-time observer in reducing the peaking phenomenon and improving estimation accuracy.

Title: Closing the Loop Inside Neural Networks: Causality-Guided Layer Adaptation for Fault Recovery Control
Authors: Mahdi Taheri, Soon-Jo Chung, Fred Y. Hadaegh
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of real-time fault recovery control for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to actuator loss of effectiveness faults and external disturbances. We derive a two-stage framework that combines causal inference with selective online adaptation to achieve an effective learning-based recovery control method. In the offline phase, we develop a causal layer attribution technique based on the average causal effect (ACE) to evaluate the relative importance of each layer in a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) controller compensating for faults. This methodology identifies a subset of high-impact layers responsible for robust fault compensation. In the online phase, we deploy a Lyapunov-based gradient update to adapt only the ACE-selected layer to circumvent the need for full-network or last-layer only updates. The proposed adaptive controller guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) with exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the presence of actuator faults and external disturbances. Compared to conventional adaptive DNN controllers with full-network adaptation, our methodology has a reduced computational overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, a case study is provided on a 3-axis attitude control system of a spacecraft with four reaction wheels.

Title: Learning Scan-Adaptive MRI Undersampling Patterns with Pre-Optimized Mask Supervision
Authors: Aryan Dhar, Siddhant Gautam, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have gained considerable attention for their ability to accelerate MRI data acquisition while maintaining scan quality. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for learning undersampling patterns directly from multi-coil MRI data. Unlike prior approaches that rely on in-training mask optimization, our method is trained with precomputed scan-adaptive optimized masks as supervised labels, enabling efficient and robust scan-specific sampling. The training procedure alternates between optimizing a reconstructor and a data-driven sampling network, which generates scan-specific sampling patterns from observed low-frequency $k$-space data. Experiments on the fastMRI multi-coil knee dataset demonstrate significant improvements in sampling efficiency and image reconstruction quality, providing a robust framework for enhancing MRI acquisition through deep learning.

Title: On the Secrecy Performance of Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Nianzu Li, Weidong Mei, Lipeng Zhu, Peiran Wu, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have recently gained significant attention as a novel reconfigurable-antenna technology due to its exceptional capability of mitigating signal-propagation path loss. In this letter, we investigate the secrecy performance of a pinching-antenna system in the presence of an eavesdropper. In particular, we derive an approximate expression of the system's secrecy outage probability (SOP) with respect to the random locations of the legitimate user and eavesdropper and analyze its asymptotic behavior. Moreover, we derive a constant performance lower bound on the SOP of the considered system, i.e., $\frac{2\pi-1}{24}$, which is significantly lower than that of conventional fixed-position antenna systems, i.e., $0.5$. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the correctness of our analytical results.

Title: Automotive Sound Quality for EVs: Psychoacoustic Metrics with Reproducible AI/ML Baselines
Authors: Mandip Goswami
Abstract: We present an open, reproducible reference for automotive sound quality that connects standardized psychoacoustic metrics with lightweight AI/ML baselines, with a specific focus on electric vehicles (EVs). We implement loudness (ISO 532-1/2), tonality (DIN 45681), and modulation-based descriptors (roughness, fluctuation strength), and document assumptions and parameterizations for reliable reuse. For modeling, we provide simple, fully reproducible baselines (logistic regression, random forest, SVM) on synthetic EV-like cases using fixed splits and seeds, reporting accuracy and rank correlations as examples of end-to-end workflows rather than a comparative benchmark. Program-level normalization is reported in LUFS via ITU-R BS.1770, while psychoacoustic analysis uses ISO-532 loudness (sones). All figures and tables are regenerated by scripts with pinned environments; code and minimal audio stimuli are released under permissive licenses to support teaching, replication, and extension to EV-specific noise phenomena (e.g., inverter whine, reduced masking).

Title: Graph Fractional Hilbert Transform: Theory and Application
Authors: Daxiang Li, Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: The graph Hilbert transform (GHT) is a key tool in constructing analytic signals and extracting envelope and phase information in graph signal processing. However, its utility is limited by confinement to the graph Fourier domain, a fixed phase shift, information loss for real-valued spectral components, and the absence of tunable parameters. The graph fractional Fourier transform introduces domain flexibility through a fractional order parameter $\alpha$ but does not resolve the issues of phase rigidity and information loss. Inspired by the dual-parameter fractional Hilbert transform (FRHT) in classical signal processing, we propose the graph FRHT (GFRHT). The GFRHT incorporates a dual-parameter framework: the fractional order $\alpha$ enables analysis across arbitrary fractional domains, interpolating between vertex and spectral spaces, while the angle parameter $\beta$ provides adjustable phase shifts and a non-zero real-valued response ($\cos\beta$) for real eigenvalues, thereby eliminating information loss. We formally define the GFRHT, establish its core properties, and design a method for graph analytic signal construction, enabling precise envelope extraction and demodulation. Experiments on edge detection, anomaly identification, and speech classification demonstrate that GFRHT outperforms GHT, offering greater flexibility and superior performance in graph signal processing.

Title: Bi-modal Prediction and Transformation Coding for Compressing Complex Human Dynamics
Authors: Huong Hoang, Keito Suzuki, Truong Nguyen, Pamela Cosman
Abstract: For dynamic human motion sequences, the original KeyNode-Driven codec often struggles to retain compression efficiency when confronted with rapid movements or strong non-rigid deformations. This paper proposes a novel Bi-modal coding framework that enhances the flexibility of motion representation by integrating semantic segmentation and region-specific transformation modeling. The rigid transformation model (rotation & translation) is extended with a hybrid scheme that selectively applies affine transformations-rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing-only to deformation-rich regions (e.g., the torso, where loose clothing induces high variability), while retaining rigid models elsewhere. The affine model is decomposed into minimal parameter sets for efficient coding and combined through a component selection strategy guided by a Lagrangian Rate-Distortion optimization. The results show that the Bi-modal method achieves more accurate mesh deformation, especially in sequences involving complex non-rigid motion, without compromising compression efficiency in simpler regions, with an average bit-rate saving of 33.81% compared to the baseline.

Title: Asymptotic Scaling Law Analysis of Multicast Satellite Communications with Massive MIMO
Authors: Seyong Kim, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite communication system that employs massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) for multicast transmission. By modeling the spatial distribution of ground users using a Poisson point process (PPP) and assuming a fixed-beam precoding is adopted, we find a closed-form expression for the asymptotical rate scaling law as a function of the number of antennas and the scaling factors of user density and multicast users. From the derived analytical expression, we reveal that the rate degradation caused by multicast transmission can be precisely compensated by increasing the user density accordingly.

Title: DroFiT: A Lightweight Band-fused Frequency Attention Toward Real-time UAV Speech Enhancement
Authors: Jeongmin Lee, Chanhong Jeon, Hyungjoo Seo, Taewook Kang
Abstract: This paper proposes DroFiT (Drone Frequency lightweight Transformer for speech enhancement, a single microphone speech enhancement network for severe drone self-noise. DroFit integrates a frequency-wise Transformer with a full/sub-band hybrid encoder-decoder and a TCN back-end for memory-efficient streaming. A learnable skip-and-gate fusion with a combined spectral-temporal loss further refines reconstruction. The model is trained on VoiceBank-DEMAND mixed with recorded drone noise (-5 to -25 dB SNR) and evaluate using standard speech enhancement metrics and computational efficiency. Experimental results show that DroFiT achieves competitive enhancement performance while significantly reducing computational and memory demands, paving the way for real-time processing on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Title: Attentive AV-FusionNet: Audio-Visual Quality Prediction with Hybrid Attention
Authors: Ina Salaj, Arijit Biswas
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning-based audio-visual quality (AVQ) prediction model that leverages internal features from state-of-the-art unimodal predictors. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simple fusion strategies, our model employs a hybrid representation that combines learned Generative Machine Listener (GML) audio features with hand-crafted Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) video features. Attention mechanisms capture cross-modal interactions and intra-modal relationships, yielding context-aware quality representations. A modality relevance estimator quantifies each modality's contribution per content, potentially enabling adaptive bitrate allocation. Experiments demonstrate improved AVQ prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse content types.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an essential tool for diagnosing breast lesions, with millions of examinations per year. However, publicly available high-quality BUS benchmarks for AI development are limited in data scale and annotation richness. In this work, we present BUS-CoT, a BUS dataset for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning analysis, which contains 11,439 images of 10,019 lesions from 4,838 patients and covers all 99 histopathology types. To facilitate research on incentivizing CoT reasoning, we construct the reasoning processes based on observation, feature, diagnosis and pathology labels, annotated and verified by experienced experts. Moreover, by covering lesions of all histopathology types, we aim to facilitate robust AI systems in rare cases, which can be error-prone in clinical practice.

Title: Online Data-Driven Reachability Analysis using Zonotopic Recursive Least Squares
Authors: Alireza Naderi Akhormeh, Amr Hegazy, Amr Alanwar
Abstract: Reachability analysis is a key formal verification technique for ensuring the safety of modern cyber physical systems subject to uncertainties in measurements, system models (parameters), and inputs. Classical model-based approaches rely on accurate prior knowledge of system dynamics, which may not always be available or reliable. To address this, we present a data-driven reachability analysis framework that computes over-approximations of reachable sets directly from online state measurements. The method estimates time-varying unknown models using an Exponentially Forgetting Zonotopic Recursive Least Squares (EF ZRLS) method, which processes data corrupted by bounded noise. Specifically, a time-varying set of models that contains the true model of the system is estimated recursively, and then used to compute the forward reachable sets under process noise and uncertain inputs. Our approach applies to both discrete-time Linear Time Varying (LTV) and nonlinear Lipschitz systems. Compared to existing techniques, it produces less conservative reachable set over approximations, remains robust under slowly varying dynamics, and operates solely on real-time data without requiring any pre-recorded offline experiments. Numerical simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Machine Learning for Campus Energy Resilience: Clustering and Time-Series Forecasting in Intelligent Load Shedding
Authors: Salim Oyinlola, Peter Olabisi Oluseyi
Abstract: The growing demand for reliable electricity in universities necessitates intelligent energy management. This study proposes a machine learning-based load shedding framework for the University of Lagos, designed to optimize distribution and reduce waste. The methodology followed three main stages. First, a dataset of 3,648 hourly records from 55 buildings was compiled to develop building-level consumption models. Second, Principal Component Analysis was applied for dimensionality reduction, and clustering validation techniques were used to determine the optimal number of demand groups. Mini-Batch K-Means was then employed to classify buildings into high-, medium-, and low-demand clusters. Finally, short-term load forecasting was performed at the cluster level using multiple statistical and deep learning models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and GRU. Results showed Prophet offered the most reliable forecasts, while Mini-Batch K-Means achieved stable clustering performance. By integrating clustering with forecasting, the framework enabled a fairer, data-driven load shedding strategy that reduces inefficiencies and supports climate change mitigation through sustainable energy management.

Title: Functional WMMSE Algorithm for Continuous Aperture Array Systems
Authors: Shiyong Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a functional extension of the weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm for downlink beamforming in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems where both the base station (BS) and the users employ continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs). The method lifts the matrices and vectors in the classical discrete WMMSE recursion to continuous functions by replacing matrix products and inner products with integrals over the apertures. In practice, we apply a Galerkin projection to map functions to coefficient matrices, solve the resulting discrete WMMSE problem via closed-form updates, and then lift these updates back to the functional domain. All integrals are implemented using Gauss-Legendre quadrature, which preserves the closed-form structure through weighted matrix products. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms baselines in both spectral efficiency (SE) and computational complexity.

Title: Vibrational Stabilization of Cluster Synchronization in Oscillator Networks
Authors: Yuzhen Qin, Alberto Maria Nobili, Danielle S. Bassett, Fabio Pasqualetti
Abstract: Cluster synchronization is of great importance for the normal functioning of numerous technological and natural systems. Deviations from normal cluster synchronization patterns are closely associated with various malfunctions, such as neurological disorders in the brain. Therefore, it is crucial to restore normal system functions by stabilizing the appropriate cluster synchronization patterns. Most existing studies focus on designing controllers based on state measurements to achieve system stabilization. However, in many real-world scenarios, measuring system states in real time, such as neuronal activity in the brain, poses significant challenges, rendering the stabilization of such systems difficult. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we employ an open-loop control strategy, vibrational control, which does not require any state measurements. We establish some sufficient conditions under which vibrational inputs stabilize cluster synchronization. Further, we provide a tractable approach to design vibrational control. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical findings.

Title: Delay compensation of multi-input distinct delay nonlinear systems via neural operators
Authors: Filip Bajraktari, Luke Bhan, Miroslav Krstic, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: In this work, we present the first stability results for approximate predictors in multi-input non-linear systems with distinct actuation delays. We show that if the predictor approximation satisfies a uniform (in time) error bound, semi-global practical stability is correspondingly achieved. For such approximators, the required uniform error bound depends on the desired region of attraction and the number of control inputs in the system. The result is achieved through transforming the delay into a transport PDE and conducting analysis on the coupled ODE-PDE cascade. To highlight the viability of such error bounds, we demonstrate our results on a class of approximators - neural operators - showcasing sufficiency for satisfying such a universal bound both theoretically and in simulation on a mobile robot experiment.

Title: MaskVCT: Masked Voice Codec Transformer for Zero-Shot Voice Conversion With Increased Controllability via Multiple Guidances
Authors: Junhyeok Lee, Helin Wang, Yaohan Guan, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Jesús Villalba, Najim Dehak
Abstract: We introduce MaskVCT, a zero-shot voice conversion (VC) model that offers multi-factor controllability through multiple classifier-free guidances (CFGs). While previous VC models rely on a fixed conditioning scheme, MaskVCT integrates diverse conditions in a single model. To further enhance robustness and control, the model can leverage continuous or quantized linguistic features to enhance intellgibility and speaker similarity, and can use or omit pitch contour to control prosody. These choices allow users to seamlessly balance speaker identity, linguistic content, and prosodic factors in a zero-shot VC setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskVCT achieves the best target speaker and accent similarities while obtaining competitive word and character error rates compared to existing baselines.

Title: Resilient Signal Reflection under CSI Perturbations: A Robust Approach for Secure RIS Communication
Authors: Mahdi Shamsi, Hadi Zayyani, Farokh Marvasti
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology in wireless communication, enabling dynamic control over signal propagation. This paper tackles the challenge of mitigating Channel State Information (CSI) perturbations in RIS-aided systems, particularly for secure communication scenarios. Leveraging a first-order approximation technique, we develop a robust approach that strengthens the resilience of RIS configurations against CSI imperfections. The study considers both untrusted user interception and stealth radar applications, focusing on optimizing signal reflection and transmission in the presence of eavesdroppers. Simulation results demonstrate notable gains in security and efficiency while maintaining low computational complexity. By extending the stability range, the proposed method updates RIS elements using only a few matrix-vector multiplications, eliminating the need for repeated inverse or pseudo-inverse computations under small channel perturbations. Additionally, the framework provides a baseline for quantifying algorithmic sensitivity to CSI variations. Overall, the findings underscore the potential of RIS to enable secure and reliable communication in next-generation networks such as 6G.

Title: Adaptive Lyapunov-constrained MPC for fault-tolerant AUV trajectory tracking
Authors: Haolin Liu, Shiliang Zhang, Xiaohui Zhang, Shangbin Jiao, Xuehui Ma, Ting Shang, Yan Yan, Wenqi Bai, Youmin Zhang
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are subject to various sources of faults during their missions, which challenges AUV control and operation in real environments. This paper addresses fault-tolerant trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under thruster failures. We propose an adaptive Lyapunov-constrained model predictive control (LMPC) that guarantees stable trajectory tracking when the AUV switches between fault and normal modes. Particularly, we model different AUV thruster faults and build online failure identification based on Bayesian approach. This facilitates a soft switch between AUV status, and the identified and updated AUV failure model feeds LMPC controller for the control law derivation. The Lyapunov constrain in LMPC ensures that the trajectory tracking control remains stable during AUV status shifts, thus mitigating severe and fatal fluctuations when an AUV thruster occurs or recovers. We conduct numerical simulations on a four-thruster planar AUV using the proposed approach. The results demonstrate smooth transitions between thruster failure types and low trajectory tracking errors compared with the benchmark adaptive MPC and backstepping control with rapid failure identification and failure accommodation during the trajectory tracking.

Title: DeepASA: An Object-Oriented One-for-All Network for Auditory Scene Analysis
Authors: Dongheon Lee, Younghoo Kwon, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: We propose DeepASA, a one-for-all model for auditory scene analysis that performs multi-input multi-output (MIMO) source separation, dereverberation, sound event detection (SED), audio classification, and direction-of-arrival estimation (DoAE) within a unified framework. DeepASA is designed for complex auditory scenes where multiple, often similar, sound sources overlap in time and move dynamically in space. To achieve robust and consistent inference across tasks, we introduce an object-oriented processing (OOP) strategy. This approach encapsulates diverse auditory features into object-centric representations and refines them through a chain-of-inference (CoI) mechanism. The pipeline comprises a dynamic temporal kernel-based feature extractor, a transformer-based aggregator, and an object separator that yields per-object features. These features feed into multiple task-specific decoders. Our object-centric representations naturally resolve the parameter association ambiguity inherent in traditional track-wise processing. However, early-stage object separation can lead to failure in downstream ASA tasks. To address this, we implement temporal coherence matching (TCM) within the chain-of-inference, enabling multi-task fusion and iterative refinement of object features using estimated auditory parameters. We evaluate DeepASA on representative spatial audio benchmark datasets, including ASA2, MC-FUSS, and STARSS23. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both source separation and auditory parameter estimation under diverse spatial auditory scenes.

Title: Estimation of Specific Gravity of Potato Tubers Using Dielectric Properties
Authors: Taorui Chen, Yuki Gao, Yi Wang, Hai-Han Sun
Abstract: Potatoes are an economically important crop, and their quality is closely related to the starch content, which is typically inferred from specific gravity (SG). Although microwave sensing technologies have been increasingly developed for underground potato detection and quality assessment in recent years, no accurate model has yet been established to link the dielectric properties of potatoes with their key agronomic traits. To address this gap, we developed a model for estimating potato tubers' SG based on their dielectric constant. To construct and validate the model, we conducted SG measurements and dielectric spectroscopy measurements in the frequency range of 0.3 GHz to 3.0 GHz on 250 potatoes of five different types (red, russet, yellow, purple, and chipping potatoes, with 50 samples per type). Out of the 250 data sets, 200 data sets were used for model development, and 50 data sets were used for model validation. A linear regression model was used to summarize the relationship between SG and dielectric constant, where the regression coefficients are expressed as fourth-order polynomial functions of frequency. Experimental results on the 50 validation data sets show that the model achieves high estimation accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAE) less than \(4.8\times10^{-3}\) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) less than 0.45\%. The study of the dielectric properties of potatoes, along with the derived SG estimation model, provides a foundation for the future development of microwave sensing technologies for agronomic trait assessment in the potato production and processing industries. All measured data will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Title: Reference-aware SFM layers for intrusive intelligibility prediction
Authors: Hanlin Yu, Haoshuai Zhou, Boxuan Cao, Changgeng Mo, Linkai Li, Shan X. Wang
Abstract: Intrusive speech-intelligibility predictors that exploit explicit reference signals are now widespread, yet they have not consistently surpassed non-intrusive systems. We argue that a primary cause is the limited exploitation of speech foundation models (SFMs). This work revisits intrusive prediction by combining reference conditioning with multi-layer SFM representations. Our final system achieves RMSE 22.36 on the development set and 24.98 on the evaluation set, ranking 1st on CPC3. These findings provide practical guidance for constructing SFM-based intrusive intelligibility predictors.

Title: BeepBank-500: A Synthetic Earcon Mini-Corpus for UI Sound Research and Psychoacoustics Research
Authors: Mandip Goswami
Abstract: We introduce BeepBank-500, a compact, fully synthetic earcon/alert dataset (300-500 clips) designed for rapid, rights-clean experimentation in human-computer interaction and audio machine learning. Each clip is generated from a parametric recipe controlling waveform family (sine, square, triangle, FM), fundamental frequency, duration, amplitude envelope, amplitude modulation (AM), and lightweight Schroeder-style reverberation. We use three reverberation settings: dry, and two synthetic rooms denoted 'rir small' ('small') and 'rir medium' ('medium') throughout the paper and in the metadata. We release mono 48 kHz WAV audio (16-bit), a rich metadata table (signal/spectral features), and tiny reproducible baselines for (i) waveform-family classification and (ii) f0 regression on single tones. The corpus targets tasks such as earcon classification, timbre analyses, and onset detection, with clearly stated licensing and limitations. Audio is dedicated to the public domain via CC0-1.0; code is under MIT. Data DOI: this https URL. Code: this https URL.

Title: RADE for Land Mobile Radio: A Neural Codec for Transmission of Speech over Baseband FM Radio Channels
Authors: David Rowe, Tibor Bece
Abstract: In the 1990s Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems evolved from analog frequency modulation (FM) to standardised digital systems. Both digital and analog FM systems now co-exist in various services and exhibit similar speech quality. The architecture of many digital radios retains the analog FM modulator and demodulator from legacy analog radios, but driven by a multi-level digital pulse train rather than an analog voice signal. We denote this architecture baseband FM (BBFM). In this paper we describe a modern machine learning approach that uses an autoencoder to send high quality, 8 kHz bandwidth speech over the BBFM channel. The speech quality is shown to be superior to analog FM over simulated LMR channels in the presence of fading, and a demonstration of the system running over commodity UHF radios is presented.

Title: Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance
Authors: Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.

Title: On Mutual Information Neural Estimation for Localization
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Manuel Buchfink, Bin Yang
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a promising candidate measure for the assessment and optimization of localization systems, as it captures nonlinear dependencies between random variables. However, the high cost of computing MI, especially for high-dimensional problems, prohibits its application for many real-world localization systems. We evaluate an algorithm from a new class of neural MI estimators called Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to approximate the MI between the set of feasible user element (UE) locations and the corresponding set of measurements from said UE locations used for positioning. We apply this estimator to a simulated multilateration (MLAT) system, where the true MI for benchmarking can be approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. The estimator is experimentally evaluated w.r.t. its convergence and consistency and we investigate the usefulness of MI for assessing simple MLAT systems.

Title: Investigation of ArUco Marker Placement for Planar Indoor Localization
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Martina Scheffler, Bin Yang
Abstract: Indoor localization of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can be realized with fiducial markers. Such systems require only a simple, monocular camera as sensor and fiducial markers as passive, identifiable position references that can be printed on a piece of paper and distributed in the area of interest. Thus, fiducial marker systems can be scaled to large areas with a minor increase in system complexity and cost. We investigate the localization behavior of the fiducial marker framework ArUco w.r.t. the placement of the markers including the number of markers, their orientation w.r.t. the camera, and the camera-marker distance. In addition, we propose a simple Kalman filter with adaptive measurement noise variances for real-time AMR tracking.

Title: GroundGazer: Camera-based indoor localization of mobile robots with millimeter accuracy at low cost
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Jakob Hüsken, Bohan Sun, Bin Yang
Abstract: Highly accurate indoor localization systems with mm positioning accuracy are currently very expensive. They include range finders (such as LiDAR), tachymeters, and motion capture systems relying on multiple high-end cameras. In this work, we introduce a high-accuracy, planar indoor localization system named GroundGazer (GG) for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). GG estimates the AMR's position with mm and its heading with sub-degree accuracy. The system requires only a monocular (fisheye) camera, a chessboard floor, and an optional laser diode. Our system is simple and low-cost, easy to set up, portable, robust, scalable to large areas and robot swarms, and potentially extendable to 3D position and orientation estimation.

Title: Improving Active Learning for Melody Estimation by Disentangling Uncertainties
Authors: Aayush Jaiswal, Parampreet Singh, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Estimating the fundamental frequency, or melody, is a core task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Various studies have explored signal processing, machine learning, and deep-learning-based approaches, with a very recent focus on utilizing uncertainty in active learning settings for melody estimation. However, these approaches do not investigate the relative effectiveness of different uncertainties. In this work, we follow a framework that disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties to guide active learning for melody estimation. Trained on a source dataset, our model adapts to new domains using only a small number of labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that epistemic uncertainty is more reliable for domain adaptation with reduced labeling effort as compared to aleatoric uncertainty.

Authors: Wei Tan, Shun Lei, Huaicheng Zhang, Guangzheng Li, Yixuan Zhang, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Rongzhi Gu, Dong Yu
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is currently a popular research area. Among its various branches, song generation has attracted growing interest. Despite the abundance of available songs, effective data preparation remains a significant challenge. Converting these songs into training-ready datasets typically requires extensive manual labeling, which is both time consuming and costly. To address this issue, we propose SongPrep, an automated preprocessing pipeline designed specifically for song data. This framework streamlines key processes such as source separation, structure analysis, and lyric recognition, producing structured data that can be directly used to train song generation models. Furthermore, we introduce SongPrepE2E, an end-to-end structured lyrics recognition model based on pretrained language models. Without the need for additional source separation, SongPrepE2E is able to analyze the structure and lyrics of entire songs and provide precise timestamps. By leveraging context from the whole song alongside pretrained semantic knowledge, SongPrepE2E achieves low Diarization Error Rate (DER) and Word Error Rate (WER) on the proposed SSLD-200 dataset. Downstream tasks demonstrate that training song generation models with the data output by SongPrepE2E enables the generated songs to closely resemble those produced by humans.

Title: Neural acoustic multipole splatting for room impulse response synthesis
Authors: Geonwoo Baek, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: Room Impulse Response (RIR) prediction at arbitrary receiver positions is essential for practical applications such as spatial audio rendering. We propose Neural Acoustic Multipole Splatting (NAMS), which synthesizes RIRs at unseen receiver positions by learning the positions of neural acoustic multipoles and predicting their emitted signals and directivities using a neural network. Representing sound fields through a combination of multipoles offers sufficient flexibility to express complex acoustic scenes while adhering to physical constraints such as the Helmholtz equation. We also introduce a pruning strategy that starts from a dense splatting of neural acoustic multipoles and progressively eliminates redundant ones during training. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic datasets indicate that the proposed method surpasses previous approaches on most metrics while maintaining rapid inference. Ablation studies reveal that multipole splatting with pruning achieves better performance than the monopole model with just 20% of the poles.

Title: Methods for Multi-objective Optimization PID Controller for quadrotor UAVs
Authors: Andrea Vaiuso, Gabriele Immordino, Ludovica Onofri, Giuliano Coppotelli, Marcello Righi
Abstract: Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into daily use requires controllers that ensure stable flight, efficient energy use, and reduced noise. Proportional integral derivative controllers remain standard but are highly sensitive to gain selection, with manual tuning often yielding suboptimal trade-offs. This paper studies different optimization techniques for the automated tuning of quadrotor proportional integral derivative gains under a unified simulation that couples a blade element momentum based aerodynamic model with a fast deep neural network surrogate, six degrees of freedom rigid body dynamics, turbulence, and a data driven acoustic surrogate model that predicts third octave spectra and propagates them to ground receivers. We compare three families of gradient-free optimizers: metaheuristics, Bayesian optimization, and deep reinforcement learning. Candidate controllers are evaluated using a composite cost function that incorporates multiple metrics, such as noise footprint and power consumption, simultaneously. Metaheuristics improve performance consistently, with Grey Wolf Optimization producing optimal results. Bayesian optimization is sample efficient but carries higher per iteration overhead and depends on the design domain. The reinforcement learning agents do not surpass the baseline in the current setup, suggesting the problem formulation requires further refinement. On unseen missions the best tuned controller maintains accurate tracking while reducing oscillations, power demand, and acoustic emissions. These results show that noise aware proportional integral derivative tuning through black box search can deliver quieter and more efficient flight without hardware changes.

Title: A Fundamental Study for Multiobjective Optimization Problems in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Ryunosuke Numata, Toshimichi Saito
Abstract: Multiobjective optimization problems are important in analysis and application of nonlinear dynamical systems. As a first step, this paper studies a biobjective optimization problem in a simple nonlinear switched dynamical system: a piecewise linear system based on a boost converter with photovoltaic input. The piecewise linearity enables us to analyze the nonlinear dynamics exactly. In the biobjective optimization problem, the first objective evaluates stability of circuit operation and the second objective evaluates average input power. A main task is analysis of a trade-off between the two objectives. Using the piecewise exact solutions, the two objectives are formulated theoretically. Using the theoretical formulae, the existence of a trade-off between the two objectives is clarified exactly. Relationship between the trade-off and parameters is also considered. The results provide fundamental information to analyze multiobjective optimization problems in various nonlinear systems and to realize their engineering applications.

Title: On the Design of Capacity-Achieving Distributions for Discrete-Time Poisson Channel with Low-Precision ADCs
Authors: Qianqian Li, Lintao Li, Lixiang Liu, Lei Yang, Caihong Gong, Hua Li, Shiya Hao, Xiaoming Dai
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of the capacity-achieving input distribution for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC) under dark current effects with low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This study introduces an efficient optimization algorithm that integrates the Newton-Raphson and Blahut-Arimoto (BA) methods to determine the capacity-achieving input distribution and the corresponding amplitudes of input mass points for the DTPC, subject to both peak and average power constraints. Additionally, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are established to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the obtained capacity-achieving distribution. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm attains $72\%$ and $83\%$ of the theoretical capacity at 5 dB for 1-bit and 2-bit quantized DTPC, respectively. Furthermore, for a finite-precision quantized DTPC (i.e., ${\log _2}K$ bits), the capacity can be achieved by a non-uniform discrete input distribution with support for $K$ mass points, under the given power constraints.

Title: FUN-SSL: Full-band Layer Followed by U-Net with Narrow-band Layers for Multiple Moving Sound Source Localization
Authors: Yuseon Choi, Hyeonseung Kim, Jewoo Jun, Jong Won Shin
Abstract: Dual-path processing along the temporal and spectral dimensions has shown to be effective in various speech processing applications. While the sound source localization (SSL) models utilizing dual-path processing such as the FN-SSL and IPDnet demonstrated impressive performances in localizing multiple moving sources, they require significant amount of computation. In this paper, we propose an architecture for SSL which introduces a U-Net to perform narrow-band processing in multiple resolutions to reduce computational complexity. The proposed model replaces the full-narrow network block in the IPDnet consisting of one full-band LSTM layer along the spectral dimension followed by one narrow-band LSTM layer along the temporal dimension with the FUN block composed of one Full-band layer followed by a U-net with Narrow-band layers in multiple scales. On top of the skip connections within each U-Net, we also introduce the skip connections between FUN blocks to enrich information. Experimental results showed that the proposed FUN-SSL outperformed previously proposed approaches with computational complexity much lower than that of the IPDnet.

Title: Single-Snapshot Localization Using Sparse Extremely Large Aperture Arrays
Authors: Yunqiao Hu, Xuesu Xiao, Steven Jones, Shunqiao Sun
Abstract: This paper investigates single-snapshot direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and target localization with coherent sparse extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) in automotive radar applications. Far-field and near-field signal models are formulated for distributed bistatic configurations. To enable noncoherent processing, a single-snapshot MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) algorithm is proposed to fuse local spectra from individual subarrays and extended to near-field localization via geometric intersection. For coherent processing, a single-snapshot ESPRIT (SS-ESPRIT) method with ambiguity dealiasing is developed to fully exploit the aperture of sparse ELAAs for high-resolution angle estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that SS-ESPRIT provides superior angular resolution for closely spaced far-field targets, while SS-MUSIC offers robustness in near-field localization and flexibility in hybrid scenarios.

Title: Audiobook-CC: Controllable Long-context Speech Generation for Multicast Audiobook
Authors: Min Liu, JingJing Yin, Xiang Zhang, Siyu Hao, Yanni Hu, Bin Lin, Yuan Feng, Hongbin Zhou, Jianhao Ye
Abstract: Existing text-to-speech systems predominantly focus on single-sentence synthesis and lack adequate contextual modeling as well as fine-grained performance control capabilities for generating coherent multicast audiobooks. To address these limitations, we propose a context-aware and emotion controllable speech synthesis framework specifically engineered for multicast audiobooks with three key innovations: a context mechanism for contextual consistency, a disentanglement paradigm to decouple style control from speech prompts for semantic consistency, and self-distillation to boost emotional expressiveness and instruction controllability. Experimental results show superior performance across the generation of narration, dialogue, and the whole chapter, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Demo samples can be found in this https URL.

Title: Coordinated Battery Electric Vehicle Charging Scheduling across Multiple Charging Stations
Authors: Saman Mehrnia, Hui Song, Nameer Al Khafaf, Mahdi Jalili, Lasantha Meegahapola, Brendan McGrath
Abstract: The uptake of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is increasing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. The rapid adoption of BEVs depends significantly on the coordinated charging/discharging infrastructure. Without it, uncontrolled and erratic charging patterns could lead to increased power losses and voltage fluctuations beyond acceptable thresholds. BEV charge scheduling presents a multi-objective optimization (MOO) challenge, demanding a balance between minimizing network impact and maximizing the benefits for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) operators and BEV owners. In this paper, we develop an MOO framework incorporating a carbon emission program and a dynamic economic dispatch problem, allowing BEV users to respond by charging and discharging through grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies according to the optimal electricity price and compensation. Furthermore, we integrate dynamic economic dispatch with time-of-use tariffs to obtain optimal market electricity prices and reduce total costs over 24 hours. Our experimental results on a sample network show that the proposed scheduling increases participation in V2G services by over 10%, increases EVCS benefits by over 20%, and reduces network losses. Furthermore, increased rates of charging/discharging, coupled with more significant carbon revenue benefits for BEV users and EVCS, contribute to better offsetting battery degradation costs.

Title: Comparator Loss: An Ordinal Contrastive Loss to Derive a Severity Score for Speech-based Health Monitoring
Authors: Jacob J Webber, Oliver Watts, Lovisa Wihlborg, David Wheatley, Johnny Tam, Christine Weaver, Suvankar Pal, Siddharthan Chandran, Cassia Valentini-Botinhao
Abstract: Monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative disease has important applications in the planning of treatment and the evaluation of future medications. Whereas much of the state-of-the-art in health monitoring from speech has been focused on classifying patients versus healthy controls, or predicting real-world health metrics, we propose here a novel measure of disease progression: the severity score. This score is derived from a model trained to minimize what we call the comparator loss. The comparator loss ensures scores follow an ordering relation, which can be based on diagnosis, clinically annotated scores, or simply the chronological order of the recordings. In addition to giving a more detailed picture than a simple discrete classification, the proposed comparator loss-based system has the potential to incorporate information from disparate health metrics, which is critical for making full use of small health-related datasets. We evaluated our proposed models based on their ability to affirmatively track the progression of patients with motor neuron disease (MND), the correlation of their output with clinical annotations such as ALSFRS-R, as well as their ability to distinguish between subjects with MND and healthy controls.

Title: Holistic Grid-Forming Control for HVDC-Connected Offshore Wind Power Plants to Provide Frequency Response
Authors: Zhenghua Xu, Dominic Gross, George Alin Raducu, Hesam Khazraj, Nicolaos A. Cutululis
Abstract: HVDC-connected offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) are expected to provide inertial response and frequency containment reserve (FCR) to help address the frequency control challenges caused by the growing penetration of power electronics in power systems. Initially dominated by communication-based and grid-following (GFL) control, recent efforts have shifted towards incorporating communication-free and grid-forming (GFM) control into HVDC-OWPP systems to enhance their frequency response capability. This paper proposes a holistic GFM control based on dual-port GFM control to improve the coordination across the entire AC-DC-AC dynamics. A frequency response model of a typical HVDC-OWPP system is developed for GFM control design. Then, dual-port GFM control and virtual synchronous generator control are implemented respectively on the HVDC system and OWPP of the typical system, where the asynchronism of onshore and offshore frequencies is revealed. Next, holistic GFM control is proposed to improve the synchronization and DC voltage regulation. Finally, simulations on the delivery of FCR and inertial response are carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control.

Title: Predicting Chest Radiograph Findings from Electrocardiograms Using Interpretable Machine Learning
Authors: Julia Matejas, Olaf Żurawski, Nils Strodthoff, Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz
Abstract: Purpose: Chest X-rays are essential for diagnosing pulmonary conditions, but limited access in resource-constrained settings can delay timely diagnosis. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), in contrast, are widely available, non-invasive, and often acquired earlier in clinical workflows. This study aims to assess whether ECG features and patient demographics can predict chest radiograph findings using an interpretable machine learning approach. Methods: Using the MIMIC-IV database, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were trained to predict diverse chest radiograph findings from ECG-derived features and demographic variables. Recursive feature elimination was performed independently for each target to identify the most predictive features. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions. Results: Models successfully predicted multiple chest radiograph findings with varying accuracy. Feature selection tailored predictors to each target, and including demographic variables consistently improved performance. SHAP analysis revealed clinically meaningful contributions from ECG features to radiographic predictions. Conclusion: ECG-derived features combined with patient demographics can serve as a proxy for certain chest radiograph findings, enabling early triage or pre-screening in settings where radiographic imaging is limited. Interpretable machine learning demonstrates potential to support radiology workflows and improve patient care.

Title: RSU-Assisted Resource Allocation for Collaborative Perception
Authors: Guowei Liu, Le Liang, Chongtao Guo, Hao Ye, Shi Jin
Abstract: As a pivotal technology for autonomous driving, collaborative perception enables vehicular agents to exchange perceptual data through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, thereby enhancing perception accuracy of all collaborators. However, existing collaborative perception frameworks often assume ample communication resources, which is usually impractical in real-world vehicular networks. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.

Title: Existence and Synthesis of Multi-Resolution Approximate Bisimulations for Continuous-State Dynamical Systems
Authors: Rudi Coppola, Yannik Schnitzer, Mirco Giacobbe, Alessandro Abate, Manuel Mazo Jr
Abstract: We present a fully automatic framework for synthesising compact, finite-state deterministic abstractions of deterministic, continuous-state autonomous systems under locally specified resolution requirements. Our approach builds on multi-resolution approximate bisimulations, a generalisation of classical $\epsilon$-approximate bisimulations, that support state-dependent error bounds and subsumes both variable- and uniform-resolution relations. We show that some systems admit multi-resolution bisimulations but no $\epsilon$-approximate bisimulation. We prove the existence of multi-resolution approximately bisimilar abstractions for all incrementally uniformly bounded ($\delta$-UB) systems, thereby broadening the applicability of symbolic verification to a larger class of dynamics; as a trivial special case, this result also covers incrementally globally asymptotically stable ($\delta$-GAS) systems. The Multi-resolution Abstraction Synthesis Problem (MRASP) is solved via a scalable Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) loop, combining mesh refinement with counterexample-driven refinement. This ensures soundness for all $\delta$-UB systems, and ensures termination in certain special cases. Experiments on linear and nonlinear benchmarks, including non-$\delta$-GAS and non-differentiable cases, demonstrate that our algorithm yields abstractions up to 50\% smaller than Lyapunov-based grids while enforcing tighter, location-dependent error guarantees.

Title: GAN-Based Multi-Microphone Spatial Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Shrishti Saha Shetu, Emanuël A. P. Habets, Andreas Brendel
Abstract: Spatial target speaker extraction isolates a desired speaker's voice in multi-speaker environments using spatial information, such as the direction of arrival (DoA). Although recent deep neural network (DNN)-based discriminative methods have shown significant performance improvements, the potential of generative approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), remains largely unexplored for this problem. In this work, we demonstrate that a GAN can effectively leverage both noisy mixtures and spatial information to extract and generate the target speaker's speech. By conditioning the GAN on intermediate features of a discriminative spatial filtering model in addition to DoA, we enable steerable target extraction with high spatial resolution of 5 degrees, outperforming state-of-the-art discriminative methods in perceptual quality-based objective metrics.

Title: SSNet: Flexible and robust channel extrapolation for fluid antenna systems enabled by an self-supervised learning framework
Authors: Yuan Gao, Yiming Liu, Runze Yu, Shengli Liu, Yanliang Jin, Shunqing Zhang, Shugong Xu, Xiaoli Chu
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) signify a pivotal advancement in 6G communication by enhancing spectral efficiency and robustness. However, obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) in FAS poses challenges due to its complex physical structure. Traditional methods, such as pilot-based interpolation and compressive sensing, are not only computationally intensive but also lack adaptability. Current extrapolation techniques relying on rigid parametric models do not accommodate the dynamic environment of FAS, while data-driven deep learning approaches demand extensive training and are vulnerable to noise and hardware imperfections. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning network (SSNet) designed for efficient and adaptive channel extrapolation in FAS. We formulate the problem of channel extrapolation in FAS as an image reconstruction task. Here, a limited number of unmasked pixels (representing the known CSI of the selected ports) are used to extrapolate the masked pixels (the CSI of unselected ports). SSNet capitalizes on the intrinsic structure of FAS channels, learning generalized representations from raw CSI data, thus reducing dependency on large labelled datasets. For enhanced feature extraction and noise resilience, we propose a mix-of-expert (MoE) module. In this setup, multiple feedforward neural networks (FFNs) operate in parallel. The outputs of the MoE module are combined using a weighted sum, determined by a gating function that computes the weights of each FFN using a softmax function. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of the proposed model. Results indicate that SSNet significantly outperforms benchmark models, such as AGMAE and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks by using a much smaller labelled dataset.

Title: Generalized Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architectures: Theory and Design via Structure-oriented Symmetric Unitary Projection
Authors: Xiaohua Zhou, Tianyu Fang, Yijie Mao, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead), and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high efficiency.

Title: On Fast Attitude Filtering Based on Matrix Fisher Distribution with Stability Guarantee
Authors: Shijie Wang, Haichao Gui, Rui Zhong
Abstract: This paper addresses two interrelated problems of the nonlinear filtering mechanism and fast attitude filtering with the matrix Fisher distribution (MFD) on the special orthogonal group. By analyzing the distribution evolution along Bayes' rule, we reveal two essential properties that enhance the performance of Bayesian attitude filters with MFDs, particularly in challenging conditions, from a theoretical viewpoint. Benefiting from the new understanding of the filtering mechanism associated with MFDs, two closed-form filters with MFDs is then proposed. These filters avoid the burdensome computations in previous MFD-based filters by introducing linearized error systems with right-invariant errors but retaining the two advantageous properties. Moreover, we leverage the two properties and closed-form filtering iteration to prove the almost-global exponential stability of the proposed filter with right-invariant error for the single-axis rotation, which, to our knowledge, is not achieved by existing directional statistics-based filters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed filters are significantly more accurate than the classic invariant Kalman filter. Besides, they are also as accurate as recent MFD-based Bayesian filters in challenging circumstances with large initial error and measurement uncertainty but consumes far less computation time (about 1/5 to 1/100 of previous MFD-based attitude filters).

Title: Addressing Model Inaccuracies in Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Diverse Alternatives
Authors: Paul Bannmüller, Périne Cunat, Ali Rajaei, Jochen Cremer
Abstract: The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested remedial actions.

Title: Lipschitz-Based Robustness Certification for Recurrent Neural Networks via Convex Relaxation
Authors: Paul Hamelbeck, Johannes Schiffer
Abstract: Robustness certification against bounded input noise or adversarial perturbations is increasingly important for deployment recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in safety-critical control applications. To address this challenge, we present RNN-SDP, a relaxation based method that models the RNN's layer interactions as a convex problem and computes a certified upper bound on the Lipschitz constant via semidefinite programming (SDP). We also explore an extension that incorporates known input constraints to further tighten the resulting Lipschitz bounds. RNN-SDP is evaluated on a synthetic multi-tank system, with upper bounds compared to empirical estimates. While incorporating input constraints yields only modest improvements, the general method produces reasonably tight and certifiable bounds, even as sequence length increases. The results also underscore the often underestimated impact of initialization errors, an important consideration for applications where models are frequently re-initialized, such as model predictive control (MPC).

Title: Joint Pilot Allocation and Sequence Design for MIMO-OFDM Systems With Channel Sparsity
Authors: Kabuto Arai, Koji Ishibashi, Hiroki Iimori, Yuto Hama, Paulo Valente Klaine, Szabolcs Malomsoky
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint optimization of pilot subcarrier allocation and non-orthogonal sequence for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under compressed sensing (CS)-based channel estimation exploiting delay and angle sparsity. Since the performance of CS-based approaches depends on a coherence metric of the sensing matrix in the measurement process, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize this coherence. Due to the discrete nature of subcarrier allocation, a straightforward formulation of the joint optimization results in a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is computationally intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of allocation candidates. To overcome the intractability of discrete variables, we introduce a block sparse penalty for pilots across all subcarriers, which ensures that the power of some unnecessary pilots approaches zero. This framework enables joint optimization using only continuous variables. In addition, we propose an efficient computation method for the coherence metric by exploiting the structure of the sensing matrix, which allows its gradient to be derived in closed form, making the joint optimization problem solvable in an efficient way via a gradient descent approach. Numerical results confirm that the proposed pilot sequence exhibits superior coherence properties and enhances the CS-based channel estimation performance.

Title: Developing a Dynamic Mobility Model for Backcasting Applications: A Case Study with Shared Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Théotime Héraud, Vinith Lakshmanan, Antonio Sciaretta
Abstract: This study proposes the application of a backcasting approach to a mobility model with the aim of defining an optimal decarbonization roadmap. The selected decision variable is the introduction of a fleet of shared autonomous vehicles. The mobility model developed is composed of six interconnected sub-models. After presenting each of these models in detail, a method is introduced to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the measure, and a necessary condition for the occurrence of an undesirable effect is identified. Simulations in both forecasting and backcasting frameworks are then conducted, demonstrating the relevance of backcasting: it enables a 10% reduction in operator costs compared to forecasting results, while maintaining the same level of emissions.

Title: Autoregressive-Gaussian Mixture Models: Efficient Generative Modeling of WSS Signals
Authors: Kathrin Klein, Benedikt Böck, Nurettin Turan, Wolfgang Utschick
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of making generative models suitable for resource-constrained environments like mobile wireless communication systems. We propose a generative model that integrates Autoregressive (AR) parameterization into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for modeling Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS) processes. By exploiting model-based insights allowing for structural constraints, the approach significantly reduces parameters while maintaining high modeling accuracy. Channel estimation experiments show that the model can outperform standard GMMs and variants using Toeplitz or circulant covariances, particularly with small sample sizes. For larger datasets, it matches the performance of conventional methods while improving computational efficiency and reducing the memory requirements.

Title: Benchmarking Humans and Machines on Complex Multilingual Speech Understanding Tasks
Authors: Sai Samrat Kankanala, Ram Chandra, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: Auditory attention and selective phase-locking are central to human speech understanding in complex acoustic scenes and cocktail party settings, yet these capabilities in multilingual subjects remain poorly understood. While machine understanding of natural speech has advanced in recent years, questions persist about comprehension of overlapped and mixed-channel speech. We propose a systematic paradigm for studying humans and machines in speech question-answering tasks in multilingual settings with clean and mixed-channel speech. For human listeners, selective attention to a target speaker was significantly better in their native language (L1) than in their second language (L2). For machine listening, speech-based large language models (LLMs) match or exceed human performance in clean, single-speaker conditions but often struggle to selectively attend in two-speaker settings. These results reveal a key divergence: humans rely on attentional cues that are more streamlined in their native language, whereas LLMs default to parallel information extraction which exceed human skills.

Title: Bridge Micro-Deformation Monitoring Scheme with Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Boxuan Sun, Hongliang Luo, Shaodan Ma, Feifei Gao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) scheme to perform bridge micro-deformation monitoring (BMDM) in complex environments. We first provide an excitation-bridge coupling model to represent the micro-deformation process of the bridge. Next, we design a novel frame structure for BMDM applications, and construct the OFDM echo channel model for basic scene of BMDM, including micro-deformation, dynamic objects, and static environment. Then, we develop a phasor statistical analysis method based on average cancellation algorithm to suppress the interference of dynamic objects, as well as a circle fitting method based on least squares algorithm to remove the interference of static environment near the monitoring area. Furthermore, we extract the micro-deformation feature vector from the OFDM echo signals after inverse discrete fourier transform (IDFT), and derive vertical micro-deformation value with the time-frequency phase resources. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BMDM scheme and its robustness against both dynamic interferences and static interferences.

Title: Nord-Parl-TTS: Finnish and Swedish TTS Dataset from Parliament Speech
Authors: Zirui Li, Jens Edlund, Yicheng Gu, Nhan Phan, Lauri Juvela, Mikko Kurimo
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) development is limited by scarcity of high-quality, publicly available speech data for most languages outside a few high-resource languages. We present Nord-Parl-TTS, an open TTS dataset for Finnish and Swedish based on speech found in the wild. Using recordings of Nordic parliamentary proceedings, we extract 900 hours of Finnish and 5090 hours of Swedish speech suitable for TTS training. The dataset is built using an adapted version of the Emilia data processing pipeline and includes unified evaluation sets to support model development and benchmarking. By offering open, large-scale data for Finnish and Swedish, Nord-Parl-TTS narrows the resource gap in TTS between high- and lower-resourced languages.

Title: RnGCam: High-speed video from rolling & global shutter measurements
Authors: Kevin Tandi, Xiang Dai, Chinmay Talegaonkar, Gal Mishne, Nick Antipa
Abstract: Compressive video capture encodes a short high-speed video into a single measurement using a low-speed sensor, then computationally reconstructs the original video. Prior implementations rely on expensive hardware and are restricted to imaging sparse scenes with empty backgrounds. We propose RnGCam, a system that fuses measurements from low-speed consumer-grade rolling-shutter (RS) and global-shutter (GS) sensors into video at kHz frame rates. The RS sensor is combined with a pseudorandom optic, called a diffuser, which spatially multiplexes scene information. The GS sensor is coupled with a conventional lens. The RS-diffuser provides low spatial detail and high temporal detail, complementing the GS-lens system's high spatial detail and low temporal detail. We propose a reconstruction method using implicit neural representations (INR) to fuse the measurements into a high-speed video. Our INR method separately models the static and dynamic scene components, while explicitly regularizing dynamics. In simulation, we show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RS compressive video methods, as well as state-of-the-art frame interpolators. We validate our approach in a dual-camera hardware setup, which generates 230 frames of video at 4,800 frames per second for dense scenes, using hardware that costs $10\times$ less than previous compressive video systems.

Title: Frequency Switching for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer
Authors: Dogay Altinel, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: A new frequency switching receiver structure is proposed for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-carrier communication systems. Each subcarrier is switched to either the energy harvesting unit or the information decoding unit, according to the optimal subcarrier allocation. To implement the system, one-bit feedback is required for each subcarrier. Two optimization problems are defined, converted to binary knapsack problems, and solved using dynamic programming approaches. Upper bounds are obtained using continuous relaxations. Power allocation is integrated to further increase the performance. Numerical studies show that the proposed frequency switching based model is better than existing models in a wide range of parameters.

Title: Diversity Combining for RF Energy Harvesting
Authors: Dogay Altinel, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: RF energy harvesting (RFEH) is a promising technology for energy requirements of wireless communication nodes. However, providing sufficient amount of energy to ensure self-sufficient devices based on RFEH may be challenging. In this paper, the use of diversity combining in RFEH systems is proposed to increase the amount of harvested energy. The power consumption of diversity combining process is also taken into account to analyze the net benefit of diversity combining. Performances of RFEH systems are investigated for selection combining (SC), equal gain combining (EGC), and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques. Simulations are conducted to compare the numerical results of SC, EGC, and MRC, and the results show that although the diversity combining techniques can improve the energy harvesting performance, the power consumption parameters have a critical importance while determining the suitable technique.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for the automatic segmentation of spinal nerve rootlets on various MRI scans. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included MRI scans from two open-access and one private dataset, consisting of 3D isotropic 3T TSE T2-weighted (T2w) and 7T MP2RAGE (T1-weighted [T1w] INV1 and INV2, and UNIT1) MRI scans. A deep learning model, RootletSeg, was developed to segment C2-T1 dorsal and ventral spinal rootlets. Training was performed on 76 scans and testing on 17 scans. The Dice score was used to compare the model performance with an existing open-source method. Spinal levels derived from RootletSeg segmentations were compared with vertebral levels defined by intervertebral discs using Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The RootletSeg model developed on 93 MRI scans from 50 healthy adults (mean age, 28.70 years $\pm$ 6.53 [SD]; 28 [56%] males, 22 [44%] females) achieved a mean $\pm$ SD Dice score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.09 for T1w-INV2, 0.65 $\pm$ 0.11 for UNIT1, 0.64 $\pm$ 0.08 for T2w, and 0.62 $\pm$ 0.10 for T1w-INV1 contrasts. Spinal-vertebral level correspondence showed a progressively increasing rostrocaudal shift, with Bland-Altman bias ranging from 0.00 to 8.15 mm (median difference between level midpoints). Conclusion: RootletSeg accurately segmented C2-T1 spinal rootlets across MRI contrasts, enabling the determination of spinal levels directly from MRI scans. The method is open-source and can be used for a variety of downstream analyses, including lesion classification, neuromodulation therapy, and functional MRI group analysis.

Title: A Scalable and Interoperable Platform for Transforming Building Information with Brick Ontology
Authors: Rozita Teymourzadeh, Yuya Nakazawa
Abstract: In the digital twin and building information era, many building automation companies searched for scalable methods to extract and analyze different building data, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, actuators, layout sections, zones, etc. The necessity for engineers to continuously manage the entire process for each new building creates scalability challenges. Furthermore, because construction information is sensitive, transferring data on vendor platforms via the cloud creates problems. This paper introduces a platform designed to address some of the common challenges in building automation. This is a smart platform designed for the transformation of building information into Brick ontology (Brick 2020) and graph formats. This technology makes it easy to retrieve historical data and converts the building point list into a Brick schema model for use in digital twin applications. The overarching goal of the proposed platform development is semi-automate the process while offering adaptability to various building configurations. This platform uses Brick schema and graph data structure techniques to minimize complexity, offering a semi-automated approach through its use of a tree-based graph structure. Moreover, the integration of Brick ontology creates a common language for interoperability and improves building information management. The seamless and offline integration of historical data within the developed platform minimizes data security risks when handling building information.

Title: A Regularized Riccati Recursion for Interior-Point Optimal Control
Authors: João Sousa-Pinto, Dominique Orban
Abstract: We derive a closed-form extension of Riccati's recursion for solving regularized LQR problems. We also show how this can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We also provide MIT-licensed implementations of our method in C++ and JAX.

Title: Accurate Thyroid Cancer Classification using a Novel Binary Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform Descriptor
Authors: Saurabh Saini, Kapil Ahuja, Marc C. Steinbach, Thomas Wick
Abstract: In this study, we develop a new CAD system for accurate thyroid cancer classification with emphasis on feature extraction. Prior studies have shown that thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images into different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer classification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound images are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple complex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence, we second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local DCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context. Another disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering of ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third conjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the textural features and propose the integration of another popular texture capturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is known to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification is carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on the only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD. The evaluation is conducted in two stages. In Stage I, thyroid nodules are categorized as benign or malignant. In Stage II, the malignant cases are further sub-classified into TI-RADS (4) and TI-RADS (5). For Stage I classification, our proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance of nearly 100% on TDID and 97% on AUITD. In Stage II classification, the proposed model again attains excellent classification of close to 100% on TDID and 99% on AUITD.

Title: LenslessMic: Audio Encryption and Authentication via Lensless Computational Imaging
Authors: Petr Grinberg, Eric Bezzam, Paolo Prandoni, Martin Vetterli
Abstract: With society's increasing reliance on digital data sharing, the protection of sensitive information has become critical. Encryption serves as one of the privacy-preserving methods; however, its realization in the audio domain predominantly relies on signal processing or software methods embedded into hardware. In this paper, we introduce LenslessMic, a hybrid optical hardware-based encryption method that utilizes a lensless camera as a physical layer of security applicable to multiple types of audio. We show that LenslessMic enables (1) robust authentication of audio recordings and (2) encryption strength that can rival the search space of 256-bit digital standards, while maintaining high-quality signals and minimal loss of content information. The approach is validated with a low-cost Raspberry Pi prototype and is open-sourced together with datasets to facilitate research in the area.

Title: Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Pranav Tiwari, Soumyodipta Nath
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.

Title: Etude: Piano Cover Generation with a Three-Stage Approach -- Extract, strucTUralize, and DEcode
Authors: Tse-Yang Che, Yuh-Jzer Joung
Abstract: Piano cover generation aims to automatically transform a pop song into a piano arrangement. While numerous deep learning approaches have been proposed, existing models often fail to maintain structural consistency with the original song, likely due to the absence of beat-aware mechanisms or the difficulty of modeling complex rhythmic patterns. Rhythmic information is crucial, as it defines structural similarity (e.g., tempo, BPM) and directly impacts the overall quality of the generated music. In this paper, we introduce Etude, a three-stage architecture consisting of Extract, strucTUralize, and DEcode stages. By pre-extracting rhythmic information and applying a novel, simplified REMI-based tokenization, our model produces covers that preserve proper song structure, enhance fluency and musical dynamics, and support highly controllable generation through style injection. Subjective evaluations with human listeners show that Etude substantially outperforms prior models, achieving a quality level comparable to that of human composers.

Title: TranTac: Leveraging Transient Tactile Signals for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation
Authors: Yinghao Wu, Shuhong Hou, Haowen Zheng, Yichen Li, Weiyi Lu, Xun Zhou, Yitian Shao
Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks such as inserting a key into a lock or plugging a USB device into a port can fail when visual perception is insufficient to detect misalignment. In these situations, touch sensing is crucial for the robot to monitor the task's states and make precise, timely adjustments. Current touch sensing solutions are either insensitive to detect subtle changes or demand excessive sensor data. Here, we introduce TranTac, a data-efficient and low-cost tactile sensing and control framework that integrates a single contact-sensitive 6-axis inertial measurement unit within the elastomeric tips of a robotic gripper for completing fine insertion tasks. Our customized sensing system can detect dynamic translational and torsional deformations at the micrometer scale, enabling the tracking of visually imperceptible pose changes of the grasped object. By leveraging transformer-based encoders and diffusion policy, TranTac can imitate human insertion behaviors using transient tactile cues detected at the gripper's tip during insertion processes. These cues enable the robot to dynamically control and correct the 6-DoF pose of the grasped object. When combined with vision, TranTac achieves an average success rate of 79% on object grasping and insertion tasks, outperforming both vision-only policy and the one augmented with end-effector 6D force/torque sensing. Contact localization performance is also validated through tactile-only misaligned insertion tasks, achieving an average success rate of 88%. We assess the generalizability by training TranTac on a single prism-slot pair and testing it on unseen data, including a USB plug and a metal key, and find that the insertion tasks can still be completed with an average success rate of nearly 70%. The proposed framework may inspire new robotic tactile sensing systems for delicate manipulation tasks.

Title: Barwise Section Boundary Detection in Symbolic Music Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Omar Eldeeb, Martin Malandro
Abstract: Current methods for Music Structure Analysis (MSA) focus primarily on audio data. While symbolic music can be synthesized into audio and analyzed using existing MSA techniques, such an approach does not exploit symbolic music's rich explicit representation of pitch, timing, and instrumentation. A key subproblem of MSA is section boundary detection-determining whether a given point in time marks the transition between musical sections. In this paper, we study automatic section boundary detection for symbolic music. First, we introduce a human-annotated MIDI dataset for section boundary detection, consisting of metadata from 6134 MIDI files that we manually curated from the Lakh MIDI dataset. Second, we train a deep learning model to classify the presence of section boundaries within a fixed-length musical window. Our data representation involves a novel encoding scheme based on synthesized overtones to encode arbitrary MIDI instrumentations into 3-channel piano rolls. Our model achieves an F1 score of 0.77, improving over the analogous audio-based supervised learning approach and the unsupervised block-matching segmentation (CBM) audio approach by 0.22 and 0.31, respectively. We release our dataset, code, and models.

Title: Learned Digital Codes for Over-the-Air Federated Learning
Authors: Antonio Tarizzo, Mohammad Kazemi, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables distributed model training across wireless devices without centralising raw data, but deployment is constrained by the wireless uplink. A promising direction is over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, which merges communication with computation. Existing digital OTA methods can achieve either strong convergence or robustness to noise, but struggle to achieve both simultaneously, limiting performance in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) where many IoT devices operate. This work proposes a learnt digital OTA framework that extends reliable operation into low-SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art. The proposed method combines an unrolled decoder with a jointly learnt unsourced random access codebook. Results show an extension of reliable operation by more than 7 dB, with improved global model convergence across all SNR levels, highlighting the potential of learning-based design for FEEL.

Title: Reproducing a Security Risk Assessment Using Computer Aided Design
Authors: Avi Shaked
Abstract: Security risk assessment is essential in establishing the trustworthiness and reliability of modern systems. While various security risk assessment approaches exist, prevalent applications are "pen and paper" implementations that -- even if performed digitally using computers -- remain prone to authoring mistakes and inconsistencies. Computer-aided design approaches can transform security risk assessments into more rigorous and sustainable efforts. This is of value to both industrial practitioners and researchers, who practice security risk assessments to reflect on systems' designs and to contribute to the discipline's state-of-the-art. In this article, we report the application of a model-based security design tool to reproduce a previously reported security assessment. The main contributions are: 1) an independent attempt to reproduce a refereed article describing a real security risk assessment of a system; 2) comparison of a new computer-aided application with a previous non-computer-aided application, based on a published, real-world case study; 3) a showcase for the potential advantages -- for both practitioners and researchers -- of using computer-aided design approaches to analyze reports and to assess systems.

Title: ORN-CBF: Learning Observation-conditioned Residual Neural Control Barrier Functions via Hypernetworks
Authors: Bojan Derajić, Sebastian Bernhard, Wolfgang Hönig
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been demonstrated as an effective method for safety-critical control of autonomous systems. Although CBFs are simple to deploy, their design remains challenging, motivating the development of learning-based approaches. Yet, issues such as suboptimal safe sets, applicability in partially observable environments, and lack of rigorous safety guarantees persist. In this work, we propose observation-conditioned neural CBFs based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which approximately recover the maximal safe sets. We exploit certain mathematical properties of the HJ value function, ensuring that the predicted safe set never intersects with the observed failure set. Moreover, we leverage a hypernetwork-based architecture that is particularly suitable for the design of observation-conditioned safety filters. The proposed method is examined both in simulation and hardware experiments for a ground robot and a quadcopter. The results show improved success rates and generalization to out-of-domain environments compared to the baselines.

Title: AISTAT lab system for DCASE2025 Task6: Language-based audio retrieval
Authors: Hyun Jun Kim, Hyeong Yong Choi, Changwon Lim
Abstract: This report presents the AISTAT team's submission to the language-based audio retrieval task in DCASE 2025 Task 6. Our proposed system employs dual encoder architecture, where audio and text modalities are encoded separately, and their representations are aligned using contrastive learning. Drawing inspiration from methodologies of the previous year's challenge, we implemented a distillation approach and leveraged large language models (LLMs) for effective data augmentation techniques, including back-translation and LLM mix. Additionally, we incorporated clustering to introduce an auxiliary classification task for further finetuning. Our best single system achieved a mAP@16 of 46.62, while an ensemble of four systems reached a mAP@16 of 48.83 on the Clotho development test split.

Title: On the de-duplication of the Lakh MIDI dataset
Authors: Eunjin Choi, Hyerin Kim, Jiwoo Ryu, Juhan Nam, Dasaem Jeong
Abstract: A large-scale dataset is essential for training a well-generalized deep-learning model. Most such datasets are collected via scraping from various internet sources, inevitably introducing duplicated data. In the symbolic music domain, these duplicates often come from multiple user arrangements and metadata changes after simple editing. However, despite critical issues such as unreliable training evaluation from data leakage during random splitting, dataset duplication has not been extensively addressed in the MIR community. This study investigates the dataset duplication issues regarding Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD), one of the largest publicly available sources in the symbolic music domain. To find and evaluate the best retrieval method for duplicated data, we employed the Clean MIDI subset of the LMD as a benchmark test set, in which different versions of the same songs are grouped together. We first evaluated rule-based approaches and previous symbolic music retrieval models for de-duplication and also investigated with a contrastive learning-based BERT model with various augmentations to find duplicate files. As a result, we propose three different versions of the filtered list of LMD, which filters out at least 38,134 samples in the most conservative settings among 178,561 files.

Title: Speech-to-See: End-to-End Speech-Driven Open-Set Object Detection
Authors: Wenhuan Lu, Xinyue Song, Wenjun Ke, Zhizhi Yu, Wenhao Yang, Jianguo Wei
Abstract: Audio grounding, or speech-driven open-set object detection, aims to localize and identify objects directly from speech, enabling generalization beyond predefined categories. This task is crucial for applications like human-robot interaction where textual input is impractical. However, progress in this domain faces a fundamental bottleneck from the scarcity of large-scale, paired audio-image data, and is further constrained by previous methods that rely on indirect, text-mediated pipelines. In this paper, we introduce Speech-to-See (Speech2See), an end-to-end approach built on a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we design a Query-Guided Semantic Aggregation module that employs learnable queries to condense redundant speech embeddings into compact semantic representations. During fine-tuning, we incorporate a parameter-efficient Mixture-of-LoRA-Experts (MoLE) architecture to achieve deeper and more nuanced cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments show that Speech2See achieves robust and adaptable performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and broad applicability.

Title: Segment-to-Act: Label-Noise-Robust Action-Prompted Video Segmentation Towards Embodied Intelligence
Authors: Wenxin Li, Kunyu Peng, Di Wen, Ruiping Liu, Mengfei Duan, Kai Luo, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Embodied intelligence relies on accurately segmenting objects actively involved in interactions. Action-based video object segmentation addresses this by linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale annotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal noise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this challenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying action-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two sources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun substitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic imprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce two types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task. Second, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a label noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies to this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual, boundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking noise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel Mask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative evaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary leakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional identity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals that different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles, governed by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced performance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of background precision. The established benchmark and source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Idiosyncratic Versus Normative Modeling of Atypical Speech Recognition: Dysarthric Case Studies
Authors: Vishnu Raja, Adithya V Ganesan, Anand Syamkumar, Ritwik Banerjee, H Andrew Schwartz
Abstract: State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper, perform poorly on atypical speech, such as that produced by individuals with dysarthria. Past works for atypical speech have mostly investigated fully personalized (or idiosyncratic) models, but modeling strategies that can both generalize and handle idiosyncracy could be more effective for capturing atypical speech. To investigate this, we compare four strategies: (a) $\textit{normative}$ models trained on typical speech (no personalization), (b) $\textit{idiosyncratic}$ models completely personalized to individuals, (c) $\textit{dysarthric-normative}$ models trained on other dysarthric speakers, and (d) $\textit{dysarthric-idiosyncratic}$ models which combine strategies by first modeling normative patterns before adapting to individual speech. In this case study, we find the dysarthric-idiosyncratic model performs better than idiosyncratic approach while requiring less than half as much personalized data (36.43 WER with 128 train size vs 36.99 with 256). Further, we found that tuning the speech encoder alone (as opposed to the LM decoder) yielded the best results reducing word error rate from 71% to 32% on average. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging both normative (cross-speaker) and idiosyncratic (speaker-specific) patterns to improve ASR for underrepresented speech populations.

Title: Discrete Diffusion Models: Novel Analysis and New Sampler Guarantees
Authors: Yuchen Liang, Yingbin Liang, Lifeng Lai, Ness Shroff
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers. Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to their empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of $\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of other stochastic processes.

Title: The Sound of Syntax: Finetuning and Comprehensive Evaluation of Language Models for Speech Pathology
Authors: Fagun Patel, Duc Q. Nguyen, Sang T. Truong, Jody Vaynshtok, Sanmi Koyejo, Nick Haber
Abstract: According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, more than 3.4 million children experience speech disorders that require clinical intervention. The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 30% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.

Title: SMART-3D: Three-Dimensional Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree
Authors: Priyanshu Agrawal, Shalabh Gupta, Zongyuan Shen
Abstract: This paper presents SMART-3D, an extension of the SMART algorithm to 3D environments. SMART-3D is a tree-based adaptive replanning algorithm for dynamic environments with fast moving obstacles. SMART-3D morphs the underlying tree to find a new path in real-time whenever the current path is blocked by obstacles. SMART-3D removed the grid decomposition requirement of the SMART algorithm by replacing the concept of hot-spots with that of hot-nodes, thus making it computationally efficient and scalable to 3D environments. The hot-nodes are nodes which allow for efficient reconnections to morph the existing tree to find a new safe and reliable path. The performance of SMART-3D is evaluated by extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments populated with randomly moving dynamic obstacles. The results show that SMART-3D achieves high success rates and low replanning times, thus highlighting its suitability for real-time onboard applications.

Title: Randomized Space-Time Sampling for Affine Graph Dynamical Systems
Authors: Le Gong, Longxiu Huang
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of dynamical sampling for graph signals influenced by a constant source term. We consider signals evolving over time according to a linear dynamical system on a graph, where both the initial state and the source term are bandlimited. We introduce two random space-time sampling regimes and analyze the conditions under which stable recovery is achievable. While our framework extends recent work on homogeneous dynamics, it addresses a fundamentally different setting where the evolution includes a constant source term. This results in a non-orthogonal-diagonalizable system matrix, rendering classical spectral techniques inapplicable and introducing new challenges in sampling design, stability analysis, and joint recovery of both the initial state and the forcing term. A key component of our analysis is the spectral graph weighted coherence, which characterizes the interplay between the sampling distribution and the graph structure. We establish sampling complexity bounds ensuring stable recovery via the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and develop a robust recovery algorithm with provable error guarantees. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Title: L2M-Reg: Building-level Uncertainty-aware Registration of Outdoor LiDAR Point Clouds and Semantic 3D City Models
Authors: Ziyang Xu, Benedikt Schwab, Yihui Yang, Thomas H. Kolbe, Christoph Holst
Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction, change detection and model refinement. However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.

Title: Tolerance of Phase Noise in Single-Carrier M-Ary QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications
Authors: Bowen Liu, Takasumi Tanabe
Abstract: Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt 3{\sigma} error criterion that maps residual distortions onto the constellation, offering a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasizes the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators.

Title: Quantum State Tomography for Tensor Networks in Two Dimensions
Authors: Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.

Title: Drum-to-Vocal Percussion Sound Conversion and Its Evaluation Methodology
Authors: Rinka Nobukawa, Makito Kitamura, Tomohiko Nakamura, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: This paper defines the novel task of drum-to-vocal percussion (VP) sound conversion. VP imitates percussion instruments through human vocalization and is frequently employed in contemporary a cappella music. It exhibits acoustic properties distinct from speech and singing (e.g., aperiodicity, noisy transients, and the absence of linguistic structure), making conventional speech or singing synthesis methods unsuitable. We thus formulate VP synthesis as a timbre transfer problem from drum sounds, leveraging their rhythmic and timbral correspondence. To support this formulation, we define three requirements for successful conversion: rhythmic fidelity, timbral consistency, and naturalness as VP. We also propose corresponding subjective evaluation criteria. We implement two baseline conversion methods using a neural audio synthesizer, the real-time audio variational autoencoder (RAVE), with and without vector quantization (VQ). Subjective experiments show that both methods produce plausible VP outputs, with the VQ-based RAVE model yielding more consistent conversion.

Title: PhysHDR: When Lighting Meets Materials and Scene Geometry in HDR Reconstruction
Authors: Hrishav Bakul Barua, Kalin Stefanov, Ganesh Krishnasamy, KokSheik Wong, Abhinav Dhall
Abstract: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is a fundamental task in many computational vision problems. Numerous data-driven methods have been proposed to address this problem; however, they lack explicit modeling of illumination, lighting, and scene geometry in images. This limits the quality of the reconstructed HDR images. Since lighting and shadows interact differently with different materials, (e.g., specular surfaces such as glass and metal, and lambertian or diffuse surfaces such as wood and stone), modeling material-specific properties (e.g., specular and diffuse reflectance) has the potential to improve the quality of HDR image reconstruction. This paper presents PhysHDR, a simple yet powerful latent diffusion-based generative model for HDR image reconstruction. The denoising process is conditioned on lighting and depth information and guided by a novel loss to incorporate material properties of surfaces in the scene. The experimental results establish the efficacy of PhysHDR in comparison to a number of recent state-of-the-art methods.

Title: PGSTalker: Real-Time Audio-Driven Talking Head Generation via 3D Gaussian Splatting with Pixel-Aware Density Control
Authors: Tianheng Zhu, Yinfeng Yu, Liejun Wang, Fuchun Sun, Wendong Zheng
Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is crucial for applications in virtual reality, digital avatars, and film production. While NeRF-based methods enable high-fidelity reconstruction, they suffer from low rendering efficiency and suboptimal audio-visual synchronization. This work presents PGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To improve rendering performance, we propose a pixel-aware density control strategy that adaptively allocates point density, enhancing detail in dynamic facial regions while reducing redundancy elsewhere. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight Multimodal Gated Fusion Module to effectively fuse audio and spatial features, thereby improving the accuracy of Gaussian deformation prediction. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PGSTalker outperforms existing NeRF- and 3DGS-based approaches in rendering quality, lip-sync precision, and inference speed. Our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and practical potential for real-world deployment.

Authors: Ragib Amin Nihal, Benjamin Yen, Takeshi Ashizawa, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: Multi-channel audio alignment is a key requirement in bioacoustic monitoring, spatial audio systems, and acoustic localization. However, existing methods often struggle to address nonlinear clock drift and lack mechanisms for quantifying uncertainty. Traditional methods like Cross-correlation and Dynamic Time Warping assume simple drift patterns and provide no reliability measures. Meanwhile, recent deep learning models typically treat alignment as a binary classification task, overlooking inter-channel dependencies and uncertainty estimation. We introduce a method that combines cross-attention mechanisms with confidence-weighted scoring to improve multi-channel audio synchronization. We extend BEATs encoders with cross-attention layers to model temporal relationships between channels. We also develop a confidence-weighted scoring function that uses the full prediction distribution instead of binary thresholding. Our method achieved first place in the BioDCASE 2025 Task 1 challenge with 0.30 MSE average across test datasets, compared to 0.58 for the deep learning baseline. On individual datasets, we achieved 0.14 MSE on ARU data (77% reduction) and 0.45 MSE on zebra finch data (18% reduction). The framework supports probabilistic temporal alignment, moving beyond point estimates. While validated in a bioacoustic context, the approach is applicable to a broader range of multi-channel audio tasks where alignment confidence is critical. Code available on: this https URL

Title: A Reliable Robot Motion Planner in Complex Real-world Environments via Action Imagination
Authors: Chengjin Wang, Yanmin Zhou, Zhipeng Wang, Zheng Yan, Feng Luan, Shuo Jiang, Runjie Shen, Hongrui Sang, Bin He
Abstract: Humans and animals can make real-time adjustments to movements by imagining their action outcomes to prevent unanticipated or even catastrophic motion failures in unknown unstructured environments. Action imagination, as a refined sensorimotor strategy, leverages perception-action loops to handle physical interaction-induced uncertainties in perception and system modeling within complex systems. Inspired by the action-awareness capability of animal intelligence, this study proposes an imagination-inspired motion planner (I-MP) framework that specifically enhances robots' action reliability by imagining plausible spatial states for approaching. After topologizing the workspace, I-MP build perception-action loop enabling robots autonomously build contact models. Leveraging fixed-point theory and Hausdorff distance, the planner computes convergent spatial states under interaction characteristics and mission constraints. By homogenously representing multi-dimensional environmental characteristics through work, the robot can approach the imagined spatial states via real-time computation of energy gradients. Consequently, experimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of I-MP in complex cluttered environments.

Title: AudioGenie-Reasoner: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Framework for Coarse-to-Fine Audio Deep Reasoning
Authors: Yan Rong, Chenxing Li, Dong Yu, Li Liu
Abstract: Audio deep reasoning is a challenging task that requires expert-level perception, multi-step logical inference, and the integration of contextual knowledge. However, existing models suffer from a gap between audio perception and reasoning abilities due to the lack of training data with explicit reasoning chains and the absence of mechanisms for active exploration and iterative refinement. To address these challenges, we propose AudioGenie-Reasoner (AGR), the first unified training-free multi-agent system that coordinates perception and reasoning over an evolving chain of textual evidence. Our key idea is a paradigm shift that transforms audio deep reasoning into complex text understanding task from a new perspective, thereby unlocking the full potential of large language models. Specifically, the design of AGR mimics the human coarse-to-fine cognitive process. It first transforms the input audio into a coarse text-based document. Then, we design a novel proactive iterative document refinement loop, featuring tool-augmented routes and specialized agents, to continuously search for missing information and augment the evidence chain in a coarse-to-fine manner until sufficient question-related information is gathered for making final predictions. Experimental results show that AGR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over existing open-source audio deep reasoning models across various benchmarks. The code will be made publicly available.

Title: Interpretable Audio Editing Evaluation via Chain-of-Thought Difference-Commonality Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Yuhang Jia, Xu Zhang, Yang Chen, Hui Wang, Enzhi Wang, Yong Qin
Abstract: Automatic mean opinion score (MOS) prediction provides a more perceptual alternative to objective metrics, offering deeper insights into the evaluated models. With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their enhanced perceptual and reasoning abilities enable more comprehensive and interpretable audio quality assessment. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of audio editing evaluation and propose the first natural language-based automated evaluation framework built on MLLMs. Our approach introduces two fine-tuning tasks to boost multi-audio understanding, combined with Chain-of-Thought prompting, and lightweight instruction tuning, to enhance step-by-step reasoning. Experiment demonstrate that our framework delivers accurate, interpretable, and text-based editing evaluation, closely aligning with human judgments and objective metrics while substantially improving over baselines. The code and demo are available at this https URL.

Title: Leveraging Multiple Speech Enhancers for Non-Intrusive Intelligibility Prediction for Hearing-Impaired Listeners
Authors: Boxuan Cao, Linkai Li, Hanlin Yu, Changgeng Mo, Haoshuai Zhou, Shan Xiang Wang
Abstract: Speech intelligibility evaluation for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners is essential for assessing hearing aid performance, traditionally relying on listening tests or intrusive methods like HASPI. However, these methods require clean reference signals, which are often unavailable in real-world conditions, creating a gap between lab-based and real-world assessments. To address this, we propose a non-intrusive intelligibility prediction framework that leverages speech enhancers to provide a parallel enhanced-signal pathway, enabling robust predictions without reference signals. We evaluate three state-of-the-art enhancers and demonstrate that prediction performance depends on the choice of enhancer, with ensembles of strong enhancers yielding the best results. To improve cross-dataset generalization, we introduce a 2-clips augmentation strategy that enhances listener-specific variability, boosting robustness on unseen datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms the non-intrusive baseline, CPC2 Champion across multiple datasets, highlighting the potential of enhancer-guided non-intrusive intelligibility prediction for real-world applications.

Title: System Relaxation for Interpretable and Adaptive Network Control
Authors: Zhiyuan Ren, Zhiliang Shuai, Wenchi Cheng
Abstract: Prevailing network control strategies, which rely on static shortest-path logic, suffer from catastrophic "stress concentration" on critical nodes. This paper introduces the System Relaxation Algorithm (SRA), a new control paradigm inspired by physical relaxation that guides a network toward an emergent equilibrium of load balance. SRA is an interpretable, 'white-box' dynamical system whose behavior is profoundly topology-dependent: in heterogeneous networks, it acts as a proactive performance optimizer, reducing peak centrality by over 80\% and increasing high-load throughput by more than 45\%; in homogeneous topologies, its objective intelligently shifts to resilience enhancement. We rigorously prove its global convergence and practical stability using the theory of non-smooth dynamical systems, establishing a predictable paradigm for network governance that intelligently trades off performance and resilience.

Title: Advancing Speech Understanding in Speech-Aware Language Models with GRPO
Authors: Avishai Elmakies, Hagai Aronowitz, Nimrod Shabtay, Eli Schwartz, Ron Hoory, Avihu Dekel
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based method for training Speech-Aware Large Language Models (SALLMs) on open-format speech understanding tasks, such as Spoken Question Answering and Automatic Speech Translation. SALLMs have proven highly effective for speech understanding tasks. GRPO has recently gained traction for its efficiency in training LLMs, and prior work has explored its application to SALLMs, primarily in multiple-choice tasks. Building on this, we focus on open-format tasks that better reflect the generative abilities of the models. Our approach leverages GRPO with BLEU as the reward signal to optimize SALLMs, and we demonstrate empirically that it surpasses standard SFT across several key metrics. Finally, we explore the potential of incorporating off-policy samples within GRPO for these tasks, highlighting avenues for further improvement and further research.

Title: Communication over LQG Control Systems: A Convex Optimization Approach to Capacity
Authors: Aharon Rips, Oron Sabag
Abstract: We study communication over control systems, where a controller-encoder selects inputs to a dynamical system in order to simultaneously regulate the system and convey a message to an observer that has access to the system's output measurements. This setup reflects implicit communication, as the controller embeds a message in the control signal. The capacity of a control system is the maximal reliable rate of the embedded message subject to a closed-loop control-cost constraint. We focus on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control systems, in which the dynamical system is given by a state-space model with Gaussian noise, and the control cost is a quadratic function of the system inputs and system states. Our main result is a convex optimization upper bound on the capacity of LQG systems. In the case of scalar systems, we prove that the upper bound yields the exact LQG system capacity. The upper bound also recovers all known results, including LQG control, feedback capacity of Gaussian channels with memory, and the LQG system capacity with a state-feedback. For vector LQG control systems, we provide a sufficient condition for tightness of the upper bound, based on the Riccati equation. Numerical simulations indicate the upper bound tightness in all tested examples, suggesting that the upper bound may be equal to the LQG system capacity in the vector case as well.

Title: MBCodec:Thorough disentangle for high-fidelity audio compression
Authors: Ruonan Zhang, Xiaoyang Hao, Yichen Han, Junjie Cao, Yue Liu, Kai Zhang
Abstract: High-fidelity neural audio codecs in Text-to-speech (TTS) aim to compress speech signals into discrete representations for faithful reconstruction. However, prior approaches faced challenges in effectively disentangling acoustic and semantic information within tokens, leading to a lack of fine-grained details in synthesized speech. In this study, we propose MBCodec, a novel multi-codebook audio codec based on Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) that learns a hierarchically structured representation. MBCodec leverages self-supervised semantic tokenization and audio subband features from the raw signals to construct a functionally-disentangled latent space. In order to encourage comprehensive learning across various layers of the codec embedding space, we introduce adaptive dropout depths to differentially train codebooks across layers, and employ a multi-channel pseudo-quadrature mirror filter (PQMF) during training. By thoroughly decoupling semantic and acoustic features, our method not only achieves near-lossless speech reconstruction but also enables a remarkable 170x compression of 24 kHz audio, resulting in a low bit rate of just 2.2 kbps. Experimental evaluations confirm its consistent and substantial outperformance of baselines across all evaluations.

Title: Generalized Momenta-Based Koopman Formalism for Robust Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems
Authors: Rajpal Singh, Aditya Singh, Chidre Shravista Kashyap, Jishnu Keshavan
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman operator formulation for Euler Lagrangian dynamics that employs an implicit generalized momentum-based state space representation, which decouples a known linear actuation channel from state dependent dynamics and makes the system more amenable to linear Koopman modeling. By leveraging this structural separation, the proposed formulation only requires to learn the unactuated dynamics rather than the complete actuation dependent system, thereby significantly reducing the number of learnable parameters, improving data efficiency, and lowering overall model complexity. In contrast, conventional explicit formulations inherently couple inputs with the state dependent terms in a nonlinear manner, making them more suitable for bilinear Koopman models, which are more computationally expensive to train and deploy. Notably, the proposed scheme enables the formulation of linear models that achieve superior prediction performance compared to conventional bilinear models while remaining substantially more efficient. To realize this framework, we present two neural network architectures that construct Koopman embeddings from actuated or unactuated data, enabling flexible and efficient modeling across different tasks. Robustness is ensured through the integration of a linear Generalized Extended State Observer (GESO), which explicitly estimates disturbances and compensates for them in real time. The combined momentum-based Koopman and GESO framework is validated through comprehensive trajectory tracking simulations and experiments on robotic manipulators, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and learning efficiency relative to state of the art alternatives.

Title: DocIQ: A Benchmark Dataset and Feature Fusion Network for Document Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Zhichao Ma, Fan Huang, Lu Zhao, Fengjun Guo, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min
Abstract: Document image quality assessment (DIQA) is an important component for various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), document restoration, and the evaluation of document image processing systems. In this paper, we introduce a subjective DIQA dataset DIQA-5000. The DIQA-5000 dataset comprises 5,000 document images, generated by applying multiple document enhancement techniques to 500 real-world images with diverse distortions. Each enhanced image was rated by 15 subjects across three rating dimensions: overall quality, sharpness, and color fidelity. Furthermore, we propose a specialized no-reference DIQA model that exploits document layout features to maintain quality perception at reduced resolutions to lower computational cost. Recognizing that image quality is influenced by both low-level and high-level visual features, we designed a feature fusion module to extract and integrate multi-level features from document images. To generate multi-dimensional scores, our model employs independent quality heads for each dimension to predict score distributions, allowing it to learn distinct aspects of document image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art general-purpose IQA models on both DIQA-5000 and an additional document image dataset focused on OCR accuracy.

Title: Bridging the gap between training and inference in LM-based TTS models
Authors: Ruonan Zhang, Lingzhou Mu, Xixin Wu, Kai Zhang
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) have shown that language model (LM) based systems offer competitive performance compared to traditional approaches. However, in training, TTS models use ground-truth (GT) tokens as prefixes to predict the next token, while in inference these tokens are not available, a gap between training and inference that is often neglected. In this study, we propose a prompt-guided hybrid training scheme to mitigate exposure bias in popular LM-based TTS systems. Our core idea is to adopt a hybrid training paradigm that combines teacher forcing with free running, thereby introducing self-generated tokens into the training process. This makes the training mode more consistent with inference, reducing the training-inference gap. In addition, we incorporate an EOS prediction mechanism during training to detect incorrect sequence termination and adaptively control the free running process. Experimental results provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of exposure bias on LM-based TTS, and demonstrate that our method effectively narrows the training-inference gap, thereby improving the quality of synthesized long-form speech.

Title: VAInpaint: Zero-Shot Video-Audio inpainting framework with LLMs-driven Module
Authors: Kam Man Wu, Zeyue Tian, Liya Ji, Qifeng Chen
Abstract: Video and audio inpainting for mixed audio-visual content has become a crucial task in multimedia editing recently. However, precisely removing an object and its corresponding audio from a video without affecting the rest of the scene remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose VAInpaint, a novel pipeline that first utilizes a segmentation model to generate masks and guide a video inpainting model in removing objects. At the same time, an LLM then analyzes the scene globally, while a region-specific model provides localized descriptions. Both the overall and regional descriptions will be inputted into an LLM, which will refine the content and turn it into text queries for our text-driven audio separation model. Our audio separation model is fine-tuned on a customized dataset comprising segmented MUSIC instrument images and VGGSound backgrounds to enhance its generalization performance. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to current benchmarks in both audio and video inpainting.

Title: Sidon: Fast and Robust Open-Source Multilingual Speech Restoration for Large-scale Dataset Cleansing
Authors: Wataru Nakata, Yuki Saito, Yota Ueda, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 3,390 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.

Title: CoBEVMoE: Heterogeneity-aware Feature Fusion with Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Collaborative Perception
Authors: Lingzhao Kong, Jiacheng Lin, Siyu Li, Kai Luo, Zhiyong Li, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@50 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception.

Title: FakeSound2: A Benchmark for Explainable and Generalizable Deepfake Sound Detection
Authors: Zeyu Xie, Yaoyun Zhang, Xuenan Xu, Yongkang Yin, Chenxing Li, Mengyue Wu, Yuexian Zou
Abstract: The rapid development of generative audio raises ethical and security concerns stemming from forged data, making deepfake sound detection an important safeguard against the malicious use of such technologies. Although prior studies have explored this task, existing methods largely focus on binary classification and fall short in explaining how manipulations occur, tracing where the sources originated, or generalizing to unseen sources-thereby limiting the explainability and reliability of detection. To address these limitations, we present FakeSound2, a benchmark designed to advance deepfake sound detection beyond binary accuracy. FakeSound2 evaluates models across three dimensions: localization, traceability, and generalization, covering 6 manipulation types and 12 diverse sources. Experimental results show that although current systems achieve high classification accuracy, they struggle to recognize forged pattern distributions and provide reliable explanations. By highlighting these gaps, FakeSound2 establishes a comprehensive benchmark that reveals key challenges and aims to foster robust, explainable, and generalizable approaches for trustworthy audio authentication.

Title: STAR: Speech-to-Audio Generation via Representation Learning
Authors: Zeyu Xie, Xuenan Xu, Yixuan Li, Mengyue Wu, Yuexian Zou
Abstract: This work presents STAR, the first end-to-end speech-to-audio generation framework, designed to enhance efficiency and address error propagation inherent in cascaded systems. Unlike prior approaches relying on text or vision, STAR leverages speech as it constitutes a natural modality for interaction. As an initial step to validate the feasibility of the system, we demonstrate through representation learning experiments that spoken sound event semantics can be effectively extracted from raw speech, capturing both auditory events and scene cues. Leveraging the semantic representations, STAR incorporates a bridge network for representation mapping and a two-stage training strategy to achieve end-to-end synthesis. With a 76.9% reduction in speech processing latency, STAR demonstrates superior generation performance over the cascaded systems. Overall, STAR establishes speech as a direct interaction signal for audio generation, thereby bridging representation learning and multimodal synthesis.

Title: SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing
Authors: Junlong Ke, Qiying Hu, Shenghai Yuan, Yuecong Xu, Jianfei Yang
Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Title: Certifiably Optimal Doppler Positioning using Opportunistic LEO Satellites
Authors: Baoshan Song, Weisong Wen, Qi Zhang, Bing Xu, Li-Ta Hsu
Abstract: To provide backup and augmentation to global navigation satellite system (GNSS), Doppler shift from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can be employed as signals of opportunity (SOP) for position, navigation and timing (PNT). Since the Doppler positioning problem is non-convex, local searching methods may produce two types of estimates: a global optimum without notice or a local optimum given an inexact initial estimate. As exact initialization is unavailable in some unknown environments, a guaranteed global optimization method in no need of initialization becomes necessary. To achieve this goal, we propose a certifiably optimal LEO Doppler positioning method by utilizing convex optimization. In this paper, the certifiable positioning method is implemented through a graduated weight approximation (GWA) algorithm and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. To guarantee the optimality, we derive the necessary conditions for optimality in ideal noiseless cases and sufficient noise bounds conditions in noisy cases. Simulation and real tests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Specially, the real test using Iridium-NEXT satellites shows that the proposed method estimates an certifiably optimal solution with an 3D positioning error of 140 m without initial estimates while Gauss-Newton and Dog-Leg are trapped in local optima when the initial point is equal or larger than 1000 km away from the ground truth. Moreover, the certifiable estimation can also be used as initialization in local searching methods to lower down the 3D positioning error to 130 m.

Title: Graph Signal Generative Diffusion Models
Authors: Yigit Berkay Uslu, Samar Hadou, Sergio Rozada, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: We introduce U-shaped encoder-decoder graph neural networks (U-GNNs) for stochastic graph signal generation using denoising diffusion processes. The architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening, with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount -- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic forecasting of stock prices.

Title: Privacy-Preserving State Estimation with Crowd Sensors: An Information-Theoretic Respective
Authors: Farhad Farokhi
Abstract: Privacy-preserving state estimation for linear time-invariant dynamical systems with crowd sensors is considered. At any time step, the estimator has access to measurements from a randomly selected sensor from a pool of sensors with pre-specified models and noise profiles. A Luenberger-like observer is used to fuse the measurements with the underlying model of the system to recursively generate the state estimates. An additive privacy-preserving noise is used to constrain information leakage. Information leakage is measured via mutual information between the identity of the sensors and the state estimate conditioned on the actual state of the system. This captures an omnipotent adversary that not only can access state estimates but can also gather direct high-quality state measurements. Any prescribed level of information leakage is shown to be achievable by appropriately selecting the variance of the privacy-preserving noise. Therefore, privacy-utility trade-off can be fine-tuned.

Title: Physics-Informed Operator Learning for Hemodynamic Modeling
Authors: Ryan Chappell, Chayan Banerjee, Kien Nguyen, Clinton Fookes
Abstract: Accurate modeling of personalized cardiovascular dynamics is crucial for non-invasive monitoring and therapy planning. State-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We investigate physics-informed neural operator learning models as efficient supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet) on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operator-supervised approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766 vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization coefficient and decreasing training overhead by 4%. Our results demonstrate that operator-based supervision effectively replaces intricate multi-component training strategies, offering a more scalable and interpretable approach to physiological modeling with reduced implementation burden.

Title: DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking
Authors: Buyin Deng, Lingxin Huang, Kai Luo, Fei Teng, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

Title: AERO-MPPI: Anchor-Guided Ensemble Trajectory Optimization for Agile Mapless Drone Navigation
Authors: Xin Chen, Rui Huang, Longbin Tang, Lin Zhao
Abstract: Agile mapless navigation in cluttered 3D environments poses significant challenges for autonomous drones. Conventional mapping-planning-control pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed "anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.

Title: Medical AI Consensus: A Multi-Agent Framework for Radiology Report Generation and Evaluation
Authors: Ahmed T. Elboardy, Ghada Khoriba, Essam A. Rashed
Abstract: Automating radiology report generation poses a dual challenge: building clinically reliable systems and designing rigorous evaluation protocols. We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy) and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets, where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report generation.

Title: Distributionally Robust Safety Verification of Neural Networks via Worst-Case CVaR
Authors: Masako Kishida
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP) framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk. This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids, polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.

Title: GPS Denied IBVS-Based Navigation and Collision Avoidance of UAV Using a Low-Cost RGB Camera
Authors: Xiaoyu Wang, Yan Rui Tan, William Leong, Sunan Huang, Rodney Teo, Cheng Xiang
Abstract: This paper proposes an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) framework for UAV navigation and collision avoidance using only an RGB camera. While UAV navigation has been extensively studied, it remains challenging to apply IBVS in missions involving multiple visual targets and collision avoidance. The proposed method achieves navigation without explicit path planning, and collision avoidance is realized through AI-based monocular depth estimation from RGB images. Unlike approaches that rely on stereo cameras or external workstations, our framework runs fully onboard a Jetson platform, ensuring a self-contained and deployable system. Experimental results validate that the UAV can navigate across multiple AprilTags and avoid obstacles effectively in GPS-denied environments.

Title: Vision-Based Driver Drowsiness Monitoring: Comparative Analysis of YOLOv5-v11 Models
Authors: Dilshara Herath, Chinthaka Abeyrathne, Prabhani Jayaweera
Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a critical factor in road accidents, accounting for thousands of fatalities and injuries each year. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of real-time, non-intrusive drowsiness detection methods, focusing on computer vision based YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithms. A publicly available dataset namely, UTA-RLDD was used, containing both awake and drowsy conditions, ensuring variability in gender, eyewear, illumination, and skin tone. Seven YOLO variants (v5s, v9c, v9t, v10n, v10l, v11n, v11l) are fine-tuned, with performance measured in terms of Precision, Recall, mAP0.5, and mAP 0.5-0.95. Among these, YOLOv9c achieved the highest accuracy (0.986 mAP 0.5, 0.978 Recall) while YOLOv11n strikes the optimal balance between precision (0.954) and inference efficiency, making it highly suitable for embedded deployment. Additionally, we implement an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) approach using Dlib's facial landmarks, which despite its low computational footprint exhibits reduced robustness under pose variation and occlusions. Our findings illustrate clear trade offs between accuracy, latency, and resource requirements, and offer practical guidelines for selecting or combining detection methods in autonomous driving and industrial safety applications.

Title: Leveraging Audio-Visual Data to Reduce the Multilingual Gap in Self-Supervised Speech Models
Authors: María Andrea Cruz Blandón, Zakaria Aldeneh, Jie Chi, Maureen de Seyssel
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has made significant advances in speech representation learning. Models like wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as speech recognition, particularly in monolingual settings. However, multilingual SSL models tend to underperform their monolingual counterparts on each individual language, especially in multilingual scenarios with few languages such as the bilingual setting. In this work, we investigate a novel approach to reduce this performance gap by introducing limited visual grounding into bilingual speech SSL models. Our results show that visual grounding benefits both monolingual and bilingual models, with especially pronounced gains for the latter, reducing the multilingual performance gap on zero-shot phonetic discrimination from 31.5% for audio-only models to 8.04% with grounding.

Title: Minimization of Nonsmooth Weakly Convex Function over Prox-regular Set for Robust Low-rank Matrix Recovery
Authors: Keita Kume, Isao Yamada
Abstract: We propose a prox-regular-type low-rank constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization model for Robust Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (RLRMR), i.e., estimate problem of low-rank matrix from an observed signal corrupted by outliers. For RLRMR, the $\ell_{1}$-norm has been utilized as a convex loss to detect outliers as well as to keep tractability of optimization models. Nevertheless, the $\ell_{1}$-norm is not necessarily an ideal robust loss because the $\ell_{1}$-norm tends to overpenalize entries corrupted by outliers of large magnitude. In contrast, the proposed model can employ a weakly convex function as a more robust loss, against outliers, than the $\ell_{1}$-norm. For the proposed model, we present (i) a projected variable smoothing-type algorithm applicable for the minimization of a nonsmooth weakly convex function over a prox-regular set, and (ii) a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of stationary point. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with the existing models that employ the $\ell_{1}$-norm.

Title: EigenSafe: A Spectral Framework for Learning-Based Stochastic Safety Filtering
Authors: Inkyu Jang, Jonghae Park, Chams E. Mballo, Sihyun Cho, Claire J. Tomlin, H. Jin Kim
Abstract: We present EigenSafe, an operator-theoretic framework for learning-enabled safety-critical control for stochastic systems. In many robotic systems where dynamics are best modeled as stochastic systems due to factors such as sensing noise and environmental disturbances, it is challenging for conventional methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to provide a holistic measure of safety. We derive a linear operator governing the dynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its dominant eigenpair provides information about safety for both individual states and the overall closed-loop system. The proposed learning framework, called EigenSafe, jointly learns this dominant eigenpair and a safe backup policy in an offline manner. The learned eigenfunction is then used to construct a safety filter that detects potentially unsafe situations and falls back to the backup policy. The framework is validated in three simulated stochastic safety-critical control tasks.

Title: Enhancing the NAO: Extending Capabilities of Legacy Robots for Long-Term Research
Authors: Austin Wilson, Sahar Kapasi, Zane Greene, Alexis E. Block
Abstract: Many research groups face challenges when legacy (unsupported) robotic platforms lose manufacturer support and cannot accommodate modern sensing, speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot that uses upgraded microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot validation study, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. Key upgrades, such as beamforming microphones and low-latency audio processing, reduced artifacts like self-hearing and improved multi-party separation. Expanded visual and thermal sensing established a foundation for future interaction capabilities. Beyond the NAO, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.

Title: Qwen3-Omni Technical Report

Abstract: We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.

Title: An Optimal Control Interpretation of Augmented Distributed Optimization Algorithms
Authors: Liam Hallinan, Ioannis Lestas
Abstract: Distributed optimization algorithms are used in a wide variety of problems involving complex network systems where the goal is for a set of agents in the network to solve a network-wide optimization problem via distributed update rules. In many applications, such as communication networks and power systems, transient performance of the algorithms is just as critical as convergence, as the algorithms link to physical processes which must behave well. Primal-dual algorithms have a long history in solving distributed optimization problems, with augmented Lagrangian methods leading to important classes of widely used algorithms, which have been observed in simulations to improve transient performance. Here we show that such algorithms can be seen as being the optimal solution to an appropriately formulated optimal control problem, i.e., a cost functional associated with the transient behavior of the algorithm is minimized, penalizing deviations from optimality during algorithm transients. This is shown for broad classes of algorithm dynamics, including the more involved setting where inequality constraints are present. The results presented improve our understanding of the performance of distributed optimization algorithms and can be used as a basis for improved formulations.

Title: Conditional Diffusion Models for CT Image Synthesis from CBCT: A Systematic Review
Authors: Alzahra Altalib, Chunhui Li, Alessandro Perelli
Abstract: Objective: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides a low-dose imaging alternative to conventional CT, but suffers from noise, scatter, and artifacts that degrade image quality. Synthetic CT (sCT) aims to translate CBCT to high-quality CT-like images for improved anatomical accuracy and dosimetric precision. Although deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often face limitations in generalizability and detail preservation. Conditional diffusion models (CDMs), with their iterative refinement process, offers a novel solution. This review systematically examines the use of CDMs for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Inclusion criteria targeted works employing conditional diffusion models specifically for sCT generation. Eleven relevant studies were identified and analyzed to address three questions: (1) What conditional diffusion methods are used? (2) How do they compare to conventional deep learning in accuracy? (3) What are their clinical implications? Results: CDMs incorporating anatomical priors and spatial-frequency features demonstrated improved structural preservation and noise robustness. Energy-guided and hybrid latent models enabled enhanced dosimetric accuracy and personalized image synthesis. Across studies, CDMs consistently outperformed traditional deep learning models in noise suppression and artefact reduction, especially in challenging cases like lung imaging and dual-energy CT. Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models show strong potential for generalized, accurate sCT generation from CBCT. However, clinical adoption remains limited. Future work should focus on scalability, real-time inference, and integration with multi-modal imaging to enhance clinical relevance.

Title: Guided Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Data-driven Controller Tuning with Digital Twins
Authors: Mahdi Nobar, Jürg Keller, Alessandro Forino, John Lygeros, Alisa Rupenyan
Abstract: We propose a \textit{guided multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization} framework for data-efficient controller tuning that integrates corrected digital twin (DT) simulations with real-world measurements. The method targets closed-loop systems with limited-fidelity simulations or inexpensive approximations. To address model mismatch, we build a multi-fidelity surrogate with a learned correction model that refines DT estimates from real data. An adaptive cost-aware acquisition function balances expected improvement, fidelity, and sampling cost. Our method ensures adaptability as new measurements arrive. The accuracy of DTs is re-estimated, dynamically adapting both cross-source correlations and the acquisition function. This ensures that accurate DTs are used more frequently, while inaccurate DTs are appropriately downweighted. Experiments on robotic drive hardware and supporting numerical studies demonstrate that our method enhances tuning efficiency compared to standard Bayesian optimization (BO) and multi-fidelity methods.

Title: Robust, Online, and Adaptive Decentralized Gaussian Processes
Authors: Fernando Llorente, Daniel Waxman, Sanket Jantre, Nathan M. Urban, Susan E. Minkoff
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible, uncertainty-aware framework for modeling complex signals, but scale cubically with data, assume static targets, and are brittle to outliers, limiting their applicability in large-scale problems with dynamic and noisy environments. Recent work introduced decentralized random Fourier feature Gaussian processes (DRFGP), an online and distributed algorithm that casts GPs in an information-filter form, enabling exact sequential inference and fully distributed computation without reliance on a fusion center. In this paper, we extend DRFGP along two key directions: first, by introducing a robust-filtering update that downweights the impact of atypical observations; and second, by incorporating a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts to time-varying functions. The resulting algorithm retains the recursive information-filter structure while enhancing stability and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale Earth system application, underscoring its potential for in-situ modeling.

Title: Prepare Before You Act: Learning From Humans to Rearrange Initial States
Authors: Yinlong Dai, Andre Keyser, Dylan P. Losey
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective across a wide range of manipulation tasks. However, IL policies often struggle when faced with out-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a previously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases, extensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and generalizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical initial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task execution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier to grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp their target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same capability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their given policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which are outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses so that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we show that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out the given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET algorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic teleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what simplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into robot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other baselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust task execution with equal amounts of total training data.

Title: HuMam: Humanoid Motion Control via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba
Authors: Yinuo Wang, Yuanyang Qi, Jinzhao Zhou, Gavin Tao
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.

Title: RadarSFD: Single-Frame Diffusion with Pretrained Priors for Radar Point Clouds
Authors: Bin Zhao, Nakul Garg
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar provides perception robust to fog, smoke, dust, and low light, making it attractive for size, weight, and power constrained robotic platforms. Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation, and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together, these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.

Title: Block-Fused Attention-Driven Adaptively-Pooled ResNet Model for Improved Cervical Cancer Classification
Authors: Saurabh Saini, Kapil Ahuja, Akshat S. Chauhan
Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and a leading cause of mortality. Many attempts have been made to develop an effective Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system; however, their performance remains limited. Using pretrained ResNet-50/101/152, we propose a novel CAD system that significantly outperforms prior approaches. Our novel model has three key components. First, we extract detailed features (color, edges, and texture) from early convolution blocks and the abstract features (shapes and objects) from later blocks, as both are equally important. This dual-level feature extraction is a new paradigm in cancer classification. Second, a non-parametric 3D attention module is uniquely embedded within each block for feature enhancement. Third, we design a theoretically motivated innovative adaptive pooling strategy for feature selection that applies Global Max Pooling to detailed features and Global Average Pooling to abstract features. These components form our Proposed Block-Fused Attention-Driven Adaptively-Pooled ResNet (BF-AD-AP-ResNet) model. To further strengthen learning, we introduce a Tri-Stream model, which unifies the enhanced features from three BF-AD-AP-ResNets. An SVM classifier is employed for final classification. We evaluate our models on two public datasets, IARC and AnnoCerv. On IARC, the base ResNets achieve an average performance of 90.91%, while our model achieves an excellent performance of 98.63%. On AnnoCerv, the base ResNets reach to 87.68%, and our model improves this significantly, reaching 93.39%. Our approach outperforms the best existing method on IARC by an average of 14.55%. For AnnoCerv, no prior competitive works are available. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the cancerous region in 97% of cases, ensuring model reliability for real-world use.

Title: Extract and Diffuse: Latent Integration for Improved Diffusion-based Speech and Vocal Enhancement
Authors: Yudong Yang, Zhan Liu, Wenyi Yu, Guangzhi Sun, Qiuqiang Kong, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable results in speech and vocal enhancement due to their ability to model complex speech data distributions. While these models generalize well to unseen acoustic environments, they may not achieve the same level of fidelity as the discriminative models specifically trained to enhance particular acoustic conditions. In this paper, we propose Ex-Diff, a novel score-based diffusion model that integrates the latent representations produced by a discriminative model to improve speech and vocal enhancement, which combines the strengths of both generative and discriminative models. Experimental results on the widely used MUSDB dataset show relative improvements of 3.7% in SI-SDR and 10.0% in SI-SIR compared to the baseline diffusion model for speech and vocal enhancement tasks, respectively. Additionally, case studies are provided to further illustrate and analyze the complementary nature of generative and discriminative models in this context.

Title: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Motion Correction in Medical Imaging
Authors: Jian Wang, Razieh Faghihpirayesh, Danny Joca, Polina Golland, Ali Gholipour
Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant value in image registration, however, current techniques are either limited by the type and range of motion they can handle, or require iterative inference and/or retraining for new imaging data. To address these limitations, we introduce UniMo, a Unified Motion Correction framework that leverages deep neural networks to correct diverse motion in medical imaging. UniMo employs an alternating optimization scheme for a unified loss function to train an integrated model of 1) an equivariant neural network for global rigid motion correction and 2) an encoder-decoder network for local deformations. It features a geometric deformation augmenter that 1) enhances the robustness of global correction by addressing local deformations from non-rigid motion or geometric distortions, and 2) generates augmented data to improve training. UniMo is a hybrid model that uses both image intensities and shapes to achieve robust performance amid appearance variations, and therefore generalizes to multiple imaging modalities without retraining. We trained and tested UniMo to track motion in fetal magnetic resonance imaging, a challenging application due to 1) both large rigid and non-rigid motion, and 2) wide variations in image appearance. We then evaluated the trained model, without retraining, on MedMNIST, lung CT, and BraTS datasets. Results show that UniMo surpassed existing motion correction methods in accuracy, and notably enabled one-time training on a single modality while maintaining high stability and adaptability across unseen datasets. By offering a unified solution to motion correction, UniMo marks a significant advance in medical imaging, especially in applications with combined bulk and local motion.

Title: FSOS-AMC: Few-Shot Open-Set Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification Over Multipath Fading Channels
Authors: Hao Zhang, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wu, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a vital role in advancing future wireless communication networks. Although deep learning (DL)-based AMC frameworks have demonstrated remarkable classification capabilities, they typically require large-scale training datasets and assume consistent class distributions between training and testing data-prerequisites that prove challenging in few-shot and open-set scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel few-shot open-set AMC (FSOS-AMC) framework that integrates a multisequence multiscale attention network (MS-MSANet), meta-prototype training, and a modular open-set classifier. The MS-MSANet extracts features from multisequence input signals, while meta-prototype training optimizes both the feature extractor and the modular open-set classifier, which can effectively categorize testing data into known modulation types or identify potential unknown modulations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our FSOS-AMC framework achieves superior performance in few-shot open-set scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the framework exhibits higher classification accuracy for both known and unknown modulations, as validated by improved accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) metrics. Moreover, the proposed framework demonstrates remarkable robustness under challenging low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Title: Anatomical feature-prioritized loss for enhanced MR to CT translation
Authors: Arthur Longuefosse, Baudouin Denis de Senneville, Gael Dournes, Ilyes Benlala, Pascal Desbarats, Fabien Baldacci
Abstract: In medical image synthesis, the precision of localized structural details is crucial, particularly when addressing specific clinical requirements such as the identification and measurement of fine structures. Traditional methods for image translation and synthesis are generally optimized for global image reconstruction but often fall short in providing the finesse required for detailed local analysis. This study represents a step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a novel anatomical feature-prioritized (AFP) loss function into the synthesis process. This method enhances reconstruction by focusing on clinically significant structures, utilizing features from a pre-trained model designed for a specific downstream task, such as the segmentation of particular anatomical regions. The AFP loss function can replace or complement global reconstruction methods, ensuring a balanced emphasis on both global image fidelity and local structural details. Various implementations of this loss function are explored, including its integration into different synthesis networks such as GAN-based and CNN-based models. Our approach is applied and evaluated in two contexts: lung MR to CT translation, focusing on high-quality reconstruction of bronchial structures, using a private dataset; and pelvis MR to CT synthesis, targeting the accurate representation of organs and muscles, utilizing a public dataset from the Synthrad2023 challenge. We leverage embeddings from pre-trained segmentation models specific to these anatomical regions to demonstrate the capability of the AFP loss to prioritize and accurately reconstruct essential features. This tailored approach shows promising potential for enhancing the specificity and practicality of medical image synthesis in clinical applications.

Title: Rethinking domain generalization in medical image segmentation: One image as one domain
Authors: Jin Hong, Bo Liu, Qiankun Zuo, Guoli Long, Siyue Li, Yudong Zhang, Shuihua Wang, Junxin Chen
Abstract: Domain shifts in medical image segmentation, particularly when data comes from different centers, pose significant challenges. Intra-center variability, such as differences in scanner models or imaging protocols, can cause domain shifts as large as, or even larger than, those between centers. To address this, we propose the "one image as one domain" (OIOD) hypothesis, which treats each image as a unique domain, enabling flexible and robust domain generalization. Based on this hypothesis, we develop a unified disentanglement-based domain generalization (UniDDG) framework, which simultaneously handles both multi-source and single-source domain generalization without requiring explicit domain labels. This approach simplifies training with a fixed architecture, independent of the number of source domains, reducing complexity and enhancing scalability. We decouple each input image into content representation and style code, then exchange and combine these within the batch for segmentation, reconstruction, and further disentanglement. By maintaining distinct style codes for each image, our model ensures thorough decoupling of content representations and style codes, improving domain invariance of the content representations. Additionally, we enhance generalization with expansion mask attention (EMA) for boundary preservation and style augmentation (SA) to simulate diverse image styles, improving robustness to domain shifts. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves Dice scores of 84.43% and 88.91% for multi-source to single-center and single-center generalization in optic disc and optic cup segmentation, respectively, and 86.96% and 88.56% for prostate segmentation, outperforming current state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, offering superior performance and adaptability across clinical settings.

Title: Network-Realised Model Predictive Control Part II: Distributed Constraint Management
Authors: Andrei Sperilă, Alessio Iovine, Sorin Olaru, Patrick Panciatici
Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the network's variables and upon those of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customizable implementations.

Title: X-GAN: A Generative AI-Powered Unsupervised Model for Main Vessel Segmentation of Glaucoma Screening
Authors: Cheng Huang, Weizheng Xie, Tsengdar J. Lee, Jui-Kai Wang, Karanjit Kooner, Ning Zhang, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Structural changes in main retinal blood vessels serve as critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma. Identifying these vessels is vital for vascular modeling yet highly challenging. This paper proposes X-GAN, a generative AI-powered unsupervised segmentation model designed for extracting main blood vessels from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. The process begins with the Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) to rapidly generate a skeleton of vessels, featuring their radii. By synergistically integrating the generative adversarial network (GAN) with biostatistical modeling of vessel radii, X-GAN enables a fast reconstruction of both 2D and 3D representations of the vessels. Based on this reconstruction, X-GAN achieves nearly 100\% segmentation accuracy without relying on labeled data or high-performance computing resources. Experimental results confirm X-GAN's superiority in evaluating main vessel segmentation compared to existing deep learning models.

Title: Handling Domain Shifts for Anomalous Sound Detection: A Review of DCASE-Related Work
Authors: Kevin Wilkinghoff, Takuya Fujimura, Keisuke Imoto, Jonathan Le Roux, Zheng-Hua Tan, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: When detecting anomalous sounds in complex environments, one of the main difficulties is that trained models must be sensitive to subtle differences in monitored target signals, while many practical applications also require them to be insensitive to changes in acoustic domains. Examples of such domain shifts include changing the type of microphone or the location of acoustic sensors, which can have a much stronger impact on the acoustic signal than subtle anomalies themselves. Moreover, users typically aim to train a model only on source domain data, which they may have a relatively large collection of, and they hope that such a trained model will be able to generalize well to an unseen target domain by providing only a minimal number of samples to characterize the acoustic signals in that domain. In this work, we review and discuss recent publications focusing on this domain generalization problem for anomalous sound detection in the context of the DCASE challenges on acoustic machine condition monitoring.

Title: Panoptic: True Joint mmWave Communication and Sensing with Compressive Sidelobe Forming
Authors: Heyu Guo, Ruiyi Shen, Florian Kosterhon, Yasaman Ghasempour
Abstract: The integration of communication and sensing functions within mmWave systems has gained attention due to the potential for enhanced passive sensing and improved communication reliability. State-of-the-art techniques separate these two functions in frequency, use of hardware, or time, i.e., sending known preambles for channel sensing or unknown symbols for communications. In this paper, we introduce Panoptic, a novel system architecture for integrated communication and sensing sharing the same hardware, frequency, and time resources. Panoptic jointly detects unknown symbols and channel components from data-modulated signals. The core idea is a new beam manipulation technique, which we call compressive sidelobe forming, that maintains a directional mainlobe toward the intended communication nodes while acquiring unique spatial information through pseudorandom sidelobe perturbations. We implemented Panoptic on 60 GHz mmWave radios and conducted extensive over-the-air experiments. Our results show that Panoptic achieves reflector angular localization error of less than 2°while at the same time supporting mmWave data communication with a negligible BER penalty when compared with conventional communication-only mmWave systems.

Title: Virtual Contraction Approach to Decentralized Adaptive Stabilization of Nonlinear Time-Delayed Networks
Authors: Yu Kawano, Zhiyong Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we exploit a diagonally dominant structure for the decentralized stabilization of unknown nonlinear time-delayed networks. To this end, we first introduce a novel generalization of virtual contraction analysis to diagonally dominant time-delayed control systems. We then show that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized using diagonal high-gains, provided that the input matrices satisfy certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant conditions. To enable stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, guaranteeing that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin while the gains converge to finite values. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is illustrated through a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.

Title: GNN Design for Learning HMIMO Beamforming
Authors: Shiyong Chen, Shengqian Han
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) has emerged as a potential technique for enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining low hardware costs and power consumption. Conventional alternating optimization algorithms have been widely employed to design HMIMO beamforming, but their high computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a learning-based alternative with low inference time. However, in HMIMO systems, the fixed phase pattern, which captures the distribution of reference-wave phases across the holographic surface disrupts the permutation equivariance (PE) property, which is essential for GNN design. To address this issue, we reformulate the beamforming problem into a PE-compliant equivalent form and propose a novel network architecture consisting of a gradient-based GNN (GGNN) followed by two projection modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher SE with significantly reduced inference time than alternating optimization methods and exhibits superior generalizability compared to other learning-based baselines.

Title: Practical Demonstrations of FR3-Band Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Acoustic Filter Design
Authors: Taran Anusorn, Omar Barrera, Jack Kramer, Ian Anderson, Ziqian Yao, Vakhtang Chulukhadze, Ruochen Lu
Abstract: This article presents an approach to control the operating frequency and fractional bandwidth (FBW) of miniature acoustic filters in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). More specifically, we used first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators (XBARs) to achieve efficient operation at 20.5 GHz. Our technique leverages the thickness-dependent resonant frequency of A1 XBARs, combined with the in-plane anisotropic properties of 128$^\circ$ Y-cut TFLN, to customize filter characteristics. The implemented three-element ladder filter prototype achieves an insertion loss (IL) of only 1.79 dB and a controlled 3-dB FBW of 8.58% at 20.5 GHz, with an out-of-band (OoB) rejection greater than 14.9 dB across the entire FR3 band, while featuring a compact footprint of 0.90 $\times$ 0.74 mm2. Moreover, an eight-element filter prototype shows an IL of 3.80 dB, an FBW of 6.12% at 22.0 GHz, and a high OoB rejection of 22.97 dB, demonstrating the potential for expanding to higher-order filters. As frequency allocation requirements become more stringent in future FR3 bands, our technique showcases promising capability in enabling compact and monolithic filter banks toward next-generation acoustic filters for 6G and beyond.

Authors: Arthur S. de Sena, Jacek Kibilda, Nurul H. Mahmood, Andre Gomes, Luiz A. DaSilva, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems to interference attacks against channel acquisition induced by beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs). Two primary attack strategies, random and aligned interference, are proposed for fully connected and group-connected reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures. Valid random reflection coefficients are generated exploiting the Takagi factorization, while potent aligned interference attacks are achieved through optimization strategies based on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) reformulation followed by projections onto the unitary manifold. Our numerical findings reveal that, when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, RSMA behaves similarly to space-division multiple access (SDMA) and thus is highly susceptible to the attack, with BD-RIS inducing severe performance loss and significantly outperforming diagonal RIS. However, under imperfect CSI, RSMA consistently demonstrates significantly greater robustness than SDMA, particularly as the system's transmit power increases.

Title: Quasi Steady-State Frequency
Authors: Joan Gutierrez-Florensa, Alvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Federico Milano
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.

Title: HiFiTTS-2: A Large-Scale High Bandwidth Speech Dataset
Authors: Ryan Langman, Xuesong Yang, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Edresson Casanova, Evelina Bakhturina, Jason Li
Abstract: This paper introduces HiFiTTS-2, a large-scale speech dataset designed for high-bandwidth speech synthesis. The dataset is derived from LibriVox audiobooks, and contains approximately 36.7k hours of English speech for 22.05 kHz training, and 31.7k hours for 44.1 kHz training. We present our data processing pipeline, including bandwidth estimation, segmentation, text preprocessing, and multi-speaker detection. The dataset is accompanied by detailed utterance and audiobook metadata generated by our pipeline, enabling researchers to apply data quality filters to adapt the dataset to various use cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our data pipeline and resulting dataset can facilitate the training of high-quality, zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models at high bandwidths.

Title: Single-step Diffusion for Image Compression at Ultra-Low Bitrates
Authors: Chanung Park, Joo Chan Lee, Jong Hwan Ko
Abstract: Although there have been significant advancements in image compression techniques, such as standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer from severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent diffusion-based models provided enhanced generative performance at low bitrates, they often yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the single-step diffusion model for image compression that delivers high perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra-low bitrates. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (i) Vector-Quantized Residual (VQ-Residual) training, which factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space, capturing both global geometry and high-frequency details; and (ii) rate-aware noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength to match the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that ours achieves comparable compression performance to state-of-the-art methods while improving decoding speed by about 50x compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly enhancing the practicality of generative codecs.

Title: Exploring the Design Space of 3D MLLMs for CT Report Generation
Authors: Mohammed Baharoon, Jun Ma, Congyu Fang, Augustin Toma, Bo Wang
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at this https URL

Title: Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Operator Cell-Free Massive MIMO in V-CRAN Architectures
Authors: Derya Nurcan-Atceken, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Aysegul Altin-Kayhan, Emil Björnson, Cicek Cavdar, Bulent Tavli
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of integer programming models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.

Title: Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Salih Gümüsbuğa, Ozan Alp Topal, Özlem Tuğfe Demir
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.

Title: On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer
Authors: Amirhossein Azarbahram, Onel L. A. López, Petar Popovski, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii) antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile, the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular coverage.

Title: Optimizing Paths for Adaptive Fly-Scan Microscopy: An Extended Version
Authors: Yu Lu, Thomas F. Lynn, Ming Du, Zichao Di, Sven Leyffer
Abstract: In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs, and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the next scan iteration.

Title: Ensemble YOLO Framework for Multi-Domain Mitotic Figure Detection in Histopathology Images
Authors: Navya Sri Kelam, Akash Parekh, Saikiran Bonthu, Nitin Singhal
Abstract: The reliable identification of mitotic figures in whole-slide histopathological images remains difficult, owing to their low prevalence, substantial morphological heterogeneity, and the inconsistencies introduced by tissue processing and staining procedures. The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated stain-invariant color perturbations and texture-preserving augmentations. Ininternal validation, YOLOv5 achieved higher precision (84.3%), while YOLOv8 offered improved recall (82.6%), reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and anchor-free detections. To capitalize on their complementary strengths, weemployed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity (85.3%) while maintaining competitive precision, yielding the best F1 score of 83.1%. On the preliminary MIDOG 2025 test leaderboard, our ensemble ranked 5th with an F1 score of 79.2%, precision of 73.6%, and recall of 85.8%, confirming that the proposed strategy generalizes effectively across unseen test data. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining anchor-based and anchor-free object detectors to advance automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.

Title: An Effective Strategy for Modeling Score Ordinality and Non-uniform Intervals in Automated Speaking Assessment
Authors: Tien-Hong Lo, Szu-Yu Chen, Yao-Ting Sung, Berlin Chen
Abstract: A recent line of research on automated speaking assessment (ASA) has benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) representations, which capture rich acoustic and linguistic patterns in non-native speech without underlying assumptions of feature curation. However, speech-based SSL models capture acoustic-related traits but overlook linguistic content, while text-based SSL models rely on ASR output and fail to encode prosodic nuances. Moreover, most prior arts treat proficiency levels as nominal classes, ignoring their ordinal structure and non-uniform intervals between proficiency labels. To address these limitations, we propose an effective ASA approach combining SSL with handcrafted indicator features via a novel modeling paradigm. We further introduce a multi-margin ordinal loss that jointly models both the score ordinality and non-uniform intervals of proficiency labels. Extensive experiments on the TEEMI corpus show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes well to unseen prompts.

Title: Prescribed-Time Event-Triggered Control for Matrix-Scaled Networks
Authors: K. P. Sunny, Rakesh R. Warier
Abstract: This article proposes a distributed control method for matrix-scaled multi-agent networks aimed at achieving convergence within a user-defined time frame. The control law of each individual agent relies only on information from neighboring agents and is updated at discrete intervals determined by state-dependent triggering functions, reducing the frequency of agent interactions. To this end, first, the controller is augmented with a time-varying gain. Then, the dynamics of the closed-loop system over the finite-time interval is transformed into an infinite-time frame using time scaling. Lyapunov-based analysis is employed to derive suitable triggering conditions that guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the time-transformed system, thereby ensuring the prescribed-time convergence of the original system.

Title: Soft Tissue Simulation and Force Estimation from Heterogeneous Structures using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Madina Kojanazarova, Sidaty El Hadramy, Jack Wilkie, Georg Rauter, Philippe C. Cattin
Abstract: Accurately simulating soft tissue deformation is crucial for surgical training, pre-operative planning, and real-time haptic feedback systems. While physics-based models such as the finite element method (FEM) provide high-fidelity results, they are often computationally expensive and require extensive preprocessing. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) architecture that predicts both tissue surface deformation and applied force from sparse point clouds. The model incorporates internal anatomical information through binary tissue profiles beneath each point and leverages E(n)-equivariant message passing to improve robustness. We collected experimental data that comprises a real silicone and bone-like phantom, and complemented it with synthetic simulations generated using FEM. Our model achieves a comparable performance to a baseline GNN on standard test cases and significantly outperforms it in rotated and cross-resolution scenarios, showing a strong generalization to unseen orientations and point densities. It also achieves a significant speed improvement, offering a solution for real-time applications. When fine-tuned on experimental data, the model maintains sub-millimeter deformation accuracy despite limited sample size and measurement noise. The results demonstrate that our approach offers an efficient, data-driven alternative to traditional simulations, capable of generalizing across anatomical configurations and supporting interactive surgical environments.

Title: Large Language Model-Empowered Decision Transformer for UAV-Enabled Data Collection
Authors: Zhixion Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, Hyundong Shin, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.

Title: Do You Hear What I Mean? Quantifying the Instruction-Perception Gap in Instruction-Guided Expressive Text-To-Speech Systems
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Tzu-Chieh Wei, Kuan-Yu Chen, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Instruction-guided text-to-speech (ITTS) enables users to control speech generation through natural language prompts, offering a more intuitive interface than traditional TTS. However, the alignment between user style instructions and listener perception remains largely unexplored. This work first presents a perceptual analysis of ITTS controllability across two expressive dimensions (adverbs of degree and graded emotion intensity) and collects human ratings on speaker age and word-level emphasis attributes. To comprehensively reveal the instruction-perception gap, we provide a data collection with large-scale human evaluations, named Expressive VOice Control (E-VOC) corpus. Furthermore, we reveal that (1) gpt-4o-mini-tts is the most reliable ITTS model with great alignment between instruction and generated utterances across acoustic dimensions. (2) The 5 analyzed ITTS systems tend to generate Adult voices even when the instructions ask to use child or Elderly voices. (3) Fine-grained control remains a major challenge, indicating that most ITTS systems have substantial room for improvement in interpreting slightly different attribute instructions.

Title: SynParaSpeech: Automated Synthesis of Paralinguistic Datasets for Speech Generation and Understanding
Authors: Bingsong Bai, Qihang Lu, Wenbing Yang, Zihan Sun, Yueran Hou, Peilei Jia, Songbai Pu, Ruibo Fu, Yingming Gao, Ya Li, Jun Gao
Abstract: Paralinguistic sounds, like laughter and sighs, are crucial for synthesizing more realistic and engaging speech. However, existing methods typically depend on proprietary datasets, while publicly available resources often suffer from incomplete speech, inaccurate or missing timestamps, and limited real-world relevance. To address these problems, we propose an automated framework for generating large-scale paralinguistic data and apply it to construct the SynParaSpeech dataset. The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with 118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving paralinguistic event detection. The dataset and audio samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Listening, Imagining & Refining: A Heuristic Optimized ASR Correction Framework with LLMs
Authors: Yutong Liu, Ziyue Zhang, Cheng Huang, Yongbin Yu, Xiangxiang Wang, Yuqing Cai, Nyima Tashi
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems remain prone to errors that affect downstream applications. In this paper, we propose LIR-ASR, a heuristic optimized iterative correction framework using LLMs, inspired by human auditory perception. LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy, generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains in transcription.

Title: Optimizing Sparse Antenna Arrays for Localization and Sensing using Vector Spherical Wave Functions
Authors: Tobias Lafer, Erik Leitinger, Klaus Witrisal
Abstract: In increasing number of electronic devices implement wideband radio technologies for localization and sensing purposes, like ultra-wideband (UWB). Such radio technologies benefit from a large number of antennas, but space for antennas is often limited, especially in devices for mobile and IoT applications. A common challenge is therefore to optimize the placement and orientations of a small number of antenna elements inside a device, leading to the best localization performance. We propose a method for systematically approaching the optimization of such sparse arrays by means of Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) and vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs). The VSWFs form the basis of a wideband signal model considering frequency, direction and polarization-dependent characteristics of the antenna array under test (AUT), together with mutual coupling and distortions from surrounding obstacles. We derive the CRLBs for localization parameters like delay and angle-of-arrival for this model under additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions, and formulate optimization problems for determining optimal antenna positions and orientations via minimization of the CRLBs. The proposed optimization procedure is demonstrated by means of an exemplary arrangement of three Crossed Exponentially Tapered Slot (XETS) antennas.

Title: On-Policy Reinforcement-Learning Control for Optimal Energy Sharing and Temperature Regulation in District Heating Systems
Authors: Xinyi Yi, Ioannis Lestas
Abstract: We address the problem of temperature regulation and optimal energy sharing in district heating systems (DHSs) where the demand and system parameters are unknown. We propose a temperature regulation scheme that employs data-driven on-policy updates that achieve these objectives. In particular, we show that the proposed control scheme converges to an optimal equilibrium point of the system, while also having guaranteed convergence to an optimal LQR control policy, thus providing good transient performance. The efficiency of our approach is also demonstrated through extensive simulations.

Title: Randomness in appendage coordination facilitates strenuous ground self-righting
Authors: Qihan Xuan, Chen Li
Abstract: Randomness is common in biological and artificial systems, resulting either from stochasticity of the environment or noise in organisms or devices themselves. In locomotor control, randomness is typically considered a nuisance. For example, during dynamic walking, randomness in stochastic terrain leads to metastable dynamics, which must be mitigated to stabilize the system around limit cycles. Here, we studied whether randomness in motion is beneficial for strenuous locomotor tasks. Our study used robotic simulation modeling of strenuous, leg-assisted, winged ground self-righting observed in cockroaches, in which unusually large randomness in wing and leg motions is present. We developed a simplified simulation robot capable of generating similar self-righting behavior and varied the randomness level in wing-leg coordination. During each wing opening attempt, the more randomness added to the time delay between wing opening and leg swinging, the more likely it was for the naive robot (which did not know what coordination is best) to self-right within a finite time. Wing-leg coordination, measured by the phase between wing and leg oscillations, had a crucial impact on self-righting outcome. Without randomness, periodic wing and leg oscillations often limited the system to visit a few bad phases, leading to failure to escape from the metastable state. With randomness, the system explored phases thoroughly and had a better chance of encountering good phases to self-right. Our study complements previous work by demonstrating that randomness helps destabilize locomotor systems from being trapped in undesired metastable states, a situation common in strenuous locomotion.

Title: Shape-induced obstacle attraction and repulsion during dynamic locomotion
Authors: Yuanfeng Han, Ratan Othayoth, Yulong Wang, Chun-Cheng Hsu, Rafael de la Tijera Obert, Evains Francois, Chen Li
Abstract: Robots still struggle to dynamically traverse complex 3-D terrain with many large obstacles, an ability required for many critical applications. Body-obstacle interaction is often inevitable and induces perturbation and uncertainty in motion that challenges closed-form dynamic modeling. Here, inspired by recent discovery of a terradynamic streamlined shape, we studied how two body shapes interacting with obstacles affect turning and pitching motions of an open-loop multi-legged robot and cockroaches during dynamic locomotion. With a common cuboidal body, the robot was attracted towards obstacles, resulting in pitching up and flipping-over. By contrast, with an elliptical body, the robot was repelled by obstacles and readily traversed. The animal displayed qualitatively similar turning and pitching motions induced by these two body shapes. However, unlike the cuboidal robot, the cuboidal animal was capable of escaping obstacle attraction and subsequent high pitching and flipping over, which inspired us to develop an empirical pitch-and-turn strategy for cuboidal robots. Considering the similarity of our self-propelled body-obstacle interaction with part-feeder interaction in robotic part manipulation, we developed a quasi-static potential energy landscape model to explain the dependence of dynamic locomotion on body shape. Our experimental and modeling results also demonstrated that obstacle attraction or repulsion is an inherent property of locomotor body shape and insensitive to obstacle geometry and size. Our study expanded the concept and usefulness of terradynamic shapes for passive control of robot locomotion to traverse large obstacles using physical interaction. Our study is also a step in establishing an energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions.

Title: Locomotor transitions in the potential energy landscape-dominated regime
Authors: Ratan Othayoth, Qihan Xuan, Yaqing Wang, Chen Li
Abstract: To traverse complex three-dimensional terrainwith large obstacles, animals and robots must transition across different modes. However, the most mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion concerns how to generate and stabilize near-steady-state, single-mode locomotion (e.g. walk, run). We know little about how to use physical interaction to make robust locomotor transitions. Here, we review our progress towards filling this gap by discovering terradynamic principles of multi-legged locomotor transitions, using simplified model systems representing distinct challenges in complex three-dimensional terrain. Remarkably, general physical principles emerge across diverse model systems, by modelling locomotor-terrain interaction using a potential energy landscape approach. The animal and robots' stereotyped locomotor modes are constrained by physical interaction. Locomotor transitions are stochastic, destabilizing, barrier-crossing transitions on the landscape. They can be induced by feed-forward self-propulsion and are facilitated by feedbackcontrolled active adjustment. General physical principles and strategies from our systematic studies already advanced robot performance in simple model systems. Efforts remain to better understand the intelligence aspect of locomotor transitions and how to compose larger-scale potential energy landscapes of complex three-dimensional terrains from simple landscapes of abstracted challenges. This will elucidate how the neuromechanical control system mediates physical interaction to generate multi-pathway locomotor transitions and lead to advancements in biology, physics, robotics and dynamical systems theory.

Title: Joint Optimization of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient Based Algorithm
Authors: Qinbo Bai, Mridul Agarwal, Vaneet Aggarwal
Abstract: Many engineering problems have multiple objectives, and the overall aim is to optimize a non-linear function of these objectives. In this paper, we formulate the problem of maximizing a non-linear concave function of multiple long-term objectives. A policy-gradient based model-free algorithm is proposed for the problem. To compute an estimate of the gradient, a biased estimator is proposed. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve convergence to within an $\epsilon$ of the global optima after sampling $\mathcal{O}(\frac{M^4\sigma^2}{(1-\gamma)^8\epsilon^4})$ trajectories where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $M$ is the number of the agents, thus achieving the same dependence on $\epsilon$ as the policy gradient algorithm for the standard reinforcement learning.

Title: A multimodal stress detection dataset with facial expressions and physiological signals
Authors: Majid Hosseini, Fahad Sohrab, Raju Gottumukkala, Ravi Teja Bhupatiraju, Satya Katragadda, Jenni Raitoharju, Alexandros Iosifidis, Moncef Gabbouj
Abstract: Affective computing has garnered the attention and interest of researchers in recent years, as there is a need for AI systems to better understand and react to human emotions. However, analyzing human emotions, such as mood or stress, is quite complex. While various stress studies use facial expressions and wearables, most existing datasets rely on processing data from a single modality. This paper presents EmpathicSchool, a novel dataset that captures facial expressions and the associated physiological signals, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature, under different stress levels. The data was collected from 30 participants during different sessions for about ninety minutes each (for a total of 40 hours). The data includes seven different signal types, including both computer vision and physiological features that can be used to detect stress. In addition, various experiments were conducted to validate the signal quality.

Title: Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Zhaolin Wang, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.

Title: Audio Contrastive-based Fine-tuning: Decoupling Representation Learning and Classification
Authors: Yang Wang, Qibin Liang, Chenghao Xiao, Yizhi Li, Noura Al Moubayed, Chenghua Lin
Abstract: Standard fine-tuning of pre-trained audio models couples representation learning with classifier training, which can obscure the true quality of the learned representations. In this work, we advocate for a disentangled two-stage framework that separates representation refinement from downstream evaluation. First, we employ a "contrastive-tuning" stage to explicitly improve the geometric structure of the model's embedding space. Subsequently, we introduce a dual-probe evaluation protocol to assess the quality of these refined representations from a geometric perspective. This protocol uses a linear probe to measure global linear separability and a k-Nearest Neighbours probe to investigate the local structure of class clusters. Our experiments on a diverse set of audio classification tasks show that our framework provides a better foundation for classification, leading to improved accuracy. Our newly proposed dual-probing framework acts as a powerful analytical lens, demonstrating why contrastive learning is more effective by revealing a superior embedding space. It significantly outperforms vanilla fine-tuning, particularly on single-label datasets with a large number of classes, and also surpasses strong baselines on multi-label tasks using a Jaccard-weighted loss. Our findings demonstrate that decoupling representation refinement from classifier training is a broadly effective strategy for unlocking the full potential of pre-trained audio models. Our code will be publicly available.

Title: On the Uniqueness of Participation Factors in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Tianwei Xia, Kai Sun
Abstract: In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.

Title: Downlink Channel Covariance Matrix Estimation via Representation Learning with Graph Regularization
Authors: Melih Can Zerin, Elif Vural, Ali Özgür Yılmaz
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.

Title: Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Vince Kurtz, Joel W. Burdick
Abstract: The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.

Title: Covariance-Based Device Activity Detection with Massive MIMO for Near-Field Correlated Channels
Authors: Ziyue Wang, Yang Li, Ya-Feng Liu, Junjie Ma
Abstract: This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we present the classical exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm for solving the MLE problem, which suffers from numerical instability when applied to correlated channels. We propose a computationally efficient inexact CD algorithm by approximating the objective function, which approximately solves the one-dimensional subproblem and improves both computational efficiency and numerical stability. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Finally, we study the MLE model in the joint device activity and data detection context. Simulation results demonstrate the computational performance of the presented algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.

Title: PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation
Authors: Yungang Yi, Weihua Li, Matthew Kuo, Quan Bai
Abstract: AI-based music generation has made significant progress in recent years. However, generating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving performance nuances. The proposed model has been evaluated using the Maestro dataset and has demonstrated improvements in generating coherent and diverse music, characterized by both structural consistency and expressive variation.

Title: KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment
Authors: Zijian Zhao, Zhijie Cai, Tingwei Chen, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Qimei Chen, Guangxu Zhu
Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping this http URL dataset and code are publicly available at this https URL .

Title: Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning
Authors: Ali Forootani, Raffaele Iervolino
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the AFL algorithm by training decentralized linear regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers and compare its results with synchronous FL algorithm to effectively handling non-IID data distributed among clients. The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements indistributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.

Title: Audio-Reasoner: Improving Reasoning Capability in Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Zhifei Xie, Mingbao Lin, Zihang Liu, Pengcheng Wu, Shuicheng Yan, Chunyan Miao
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reasoning have largely overlooked the audio modality. We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations. Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks, including MMAU-mini (+25.42%), AIR-Bench chat/foundation(+14.57%/+10.13%), and MELD (+8.01%). Our findings stress the core of structured CoT training in advancing audio reasoning.

Title: RGBSQGrasp: Inferring Local Superquadric Primitives from Single RGB Image for Graspability-Aware Bin Picking
Authors: Yifeng Xu, Fan Zhu, Ye Li, Sebastian Ren, Xiaonan Huang, Yuhao Chen
Abstract: Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92\% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.

Title: Sensorless Remote Center of Motion Misalignment Estimation
Authors: Hao Yang, Lidia Al-Zogbi, Ahmet Yildiz, Nabil Simaan, Jie Ying Wu
Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery constrains instrument motion around a fixed pivot point at the incision into a patient to minimize tissue trauma. Surgical robots achieve this through either hardware to software-based remote center of motion (RCM) constraints. However, accurate RCM alignment is difficult due to manual trocar placement, patient motion, and tissue deformation. Misalignment between the robot's RCM point and the patient incision site can cause unsafe forces at the incision site. This paper presents a sensorless force estimation-based framework for dynamically assessing and optimizing RCM misalignment in robotic surgery. Our experiments demonstrate that misalignment exceeding 20 mm can generate large enough forces to potentially damage tissue, emphasizing the need for precise RCM positioning. For misalignment $D\geq $ 20 mm, our optimization algorithm estimates the RCM offset with an absolute error within 5 mm. Accurate RCM misalignment estimation is a step toward automated RCM misalignment compensation, enhancing safety and reducing tissue damage in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery.

Title: Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases
Authors: Srikar Annamraju, Harris Nisar, Dayu Xia, Shankar A. Deka, Anne Horowitz, Nadica Miljković, Dušan M. Stipanović
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.

Title: A Simple Review of EEG Foundation Models: Datasets, Advancements and Future Perspectives
Authors: Junhong Lai, Jiyu Wei, Lin Yao, Yueming Wang
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a crucial role in understanding brain activity and diagnosing neurological diseases. Because supervised EEG encoders are unable to learn robust EEG patterns and rely too heavily on expensive signal annotation, research has turned to general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, known as EEG-based models (EEG-FMs), to achieve robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the readiness of early EEG-FMs for practical applications and the standards for long-term research progress remain unclear. Therefore, a systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is necessary to understand their current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To this end, this study reviews 14 early EEG-FMs and provides a critical comprehensive analysis of their methodologies, empirical findings, and unaddressed research gaps. This review focuses on the latest developments in EEG-based models (EEG-FMs), which have shown great potential for processing and analyzing EEG data. We discuss various EEG-FMs, including their architectures, pretraining strategies, pretraining and downstream datasets, and other details. This review also highlights challenges and future directions in the field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners interested in EEG analysis and related EEG-FM.

Title: Generative Diffusion Models for Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks
Authors: Yigit Berkay Uslu, Samar Hadou, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.

Title: Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System
Authors: Haiquan Lu, Yong Zeng, Shaodan Ma, Bin Li, Shi Jin, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication when the uniform plane wave (UPW) model holds, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying minimum safe distance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.

Title: Absorb and Converge: Provable Convergence Guarantee for Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Models
Authors: Yuchen Liang, Renxiang Huang, Lifeng Lai, Ness Shroff, Yingbin Liang
Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.

Title: Speech Recognition on TV Series with Video-guided Post-ASR Correction
Authors: Haoyuan Yang, Yue Zhang, Liqiang Jing, John H.L. Hansen
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle in complex environments such as TV series, where multiple speakers, overlapping speech, domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing approaches fail to explicitly leverage the rich temporal and contextual information available in the video. To address this limitation, we propose a Video-Guided Post-ASR Correction (VPC) framework that uses a Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to capture video context and refine ASR outputs. Evaluations on a TV-series benchmark show that our method consistently improves transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

Title: SoundMind: RL-Incentivized Logic Reasoning for Audio-Language Models
Authors: Xingjian Diao, Chunhui Zhang, Keyi Kong, Weiyi Wu, Chiyu Ma, Zhongyu Ouyang, Peijun Qing, Soroush Vosoughi, Jiang Gui
Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their extension to the audio modality, particularly within large audio-language models (LALMs), remains underexplored. Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach that involves a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive solution for audio logical reasoning (ALR) tasks: we introduce SoundMind, a dataset of 6,446 audio-text annotated samples specifically curated to support complex reasoning. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to equip audio-language models with robust audio-text reasoning capabilities. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the proposed SoundMind dataset using SoundMind-RL, we achieve strong and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SoundMind benchmark. This work highlights the benefit of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, and contributes to advancing auditory intelligence in language models.

Title: Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition
Authors: Wule Mao, Zhouheng Li, Yunhao Luo, Yilun Du, Lei Xie
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning in complex environments must balance stringent collision avoidance with real-time efficiency, which is a long-standing challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

Title: Improving Drone Racing Performance Through Iterative Learning MPC
Authors: Haocheng Zhao, Niklas Schlüter, Lukas Brunke, Angela P. Schoellig
Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics. While iterative learning model predictive control (LMPC) offers a promising framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence, (2) a shifted local safe set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates, and (3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85%. Even applied to the most aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real drone, a 6.05% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak performance of drone racing.

Title: From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Yuhang Jia, Xu Zhang, Yujie Guo, Yang Chen, Shiwan Zhao
Abstract: Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.

Title: Optimizing Microgrid Composition for Sustainable Data Centers
Authors: Julius Irion, Philipp Wiesner, Jonathan Bader, Odej Kao
Abstract: As computing energy demand continues to grow and electrical grid infrastructure struggles to keep pace, an increasing number of data centers are being planned with colocated microgrids that integrate on-site renewable generation and energy storage. However, while existing research has examined the tradeoffs between operational and embodied carbon emissions in the context of renewable energy certificates, there is a lack of tools to assess how the sizing and composition of microgrid components affects long-term sustainability and power reliability. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework that extends the computing and energy system co-simulator Vessim with detailed renewable energy generation models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM). Our framework simulates the interaction between computing workloads, on-site renewable production, and energy storage, capturing both operational and embodied emissions. We use a multi-horizon black-box optimization to explore efficient microgrid compositions and enable operators to make more informed decisions when planning energy systems for data centers.

Title: Mini-Omni-Reasoner: Token-Level Thinking-in-Speaking in Large Speech Models
Authors: Zhifei Xie, Ziyang Ma, Zihang Liu, Kaiyu Pang, Hongyu Li, Jialin Zhang, Yue Liao, Deheng Ye, Chunyan Miao, Shuicheng Yan
Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Title: Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise
Authors: Nader Shakibay Senobari
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from eight major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.

Title: Handling Infinite Domain Parameters in Planning Through Best-First Search with Delayed Partial Expansions
Authors: Ángel Aso-Mollar, Diego Aineto, Enrico Scala, Eva Onaindia
Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first, heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Title: TSPC: A Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric Architecture for code-switching Vietnamese-English Speech Recognition
Authors: Minh N. H. Nguyen, Anh Nguyen Tran, Dung Truong Dinh, Nam Van Vo
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 19.9% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios

Title: Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu, Mikko Sillanpää
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds. The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law. Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn. These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Title: VStyle: A Benchmark for Voice Style Adaptation with Spoken Instructions
Authors: Jun Zhan, Mingyang Han, Yuxuan Xie, Chen Wang, Dong Zhang, Kexin Huang, Haoxiang Shi, DongXiao Wang, Tengtao Song, Qinyuan Cheng, Shimin Li, Jun Song, Xipeng Qiu, Bo Zheng
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have emerged as a unified paradigm for speech understanding and generation, enabling natural human machine interaction. However, while most progress has focused on semantic accuracy and instruction following, the ability of SLMs to adapt their speaking style based on spoken instructions has received limited attention. We introduce Voice Style Adaptation (VSA), a new task that examines whether SLMs can modify their speaking style, such as timbre, prosody, or persona following natural language spoken commands. To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese & English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge) framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness, style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task. By releasing VStyle and its evaluation toolkit, we aim to provide the community with a foundation for advancing human centered spoken interaction. The dataset and code are publicly available at \href{this https URL}{project's homepage}.

Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.

Title: Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty
Authors: Vahab Rostampour
Abstract: Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.

Title: Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis
Authors: Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu, Mikko Sillanpää
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the `power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty, making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a `safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps. One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden `power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design philosophies.

Title: Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation for Autonomous Racing
Authors: Christopher Oeltjen, Carson Sobolewski, Saleh Faghfoorian, Lorant Domokos, Giancarlo Vidal, Ivan Ruchkin
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions, and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous driving.

Title: EMO-RL: Emotion-Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Audio-Language Model for Generalized Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Pengcheng Li, Botao Zhao, Zuheng Kang, Junqing Peng, Xiaoyang Qu, Yayun He, Jianzong Wang
Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in auditory understanding, their performance in affective computing scenarios, particularly in emotion recognition, reasoning, and subtle sentiment differentiation, remains suboptimal. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown promise in improving LALMs' reasoning abilities. However, two critical challenges hinder the direct application of RL techniques to Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) tasks: (1) convergence instability caused by ambiguous emotional boundaries and (2) limited reasoning ability when using relatively small models (e.g., 7B-parameter architectures). To overcome these limitations, we introduce EMO-RL, a novel framework incorporating reinforcement learning with two key innovations: Emotion Similarity-Weighted Reward (ESWR) and Explicit Structured Reasoning (ESR). Built upon pretrained LALMs, our method employs group-relative policy optimization with emotion constraints. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our EMO-RL training strategies can significantly enhance the emotional reasoning capabilities of LALMs, attaining state-of-the-art results on both the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets, and cross-dataset experiments prove the strong superiority of generalization.

Title: TISDiSS: A Training-Time and Inference-Time Scalable Framework for Discriminative Source Separation
Authors: Yongsheng Feng, Yuetonghui Xu, Jiehui Luo, Hongjia Liu, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Wei Li
Abstract: Source separation is a fundamental task in speech, music, and audio processing, and it also provides cleaner and larger data for training generative models. However, improving separation performance in practice often depends on increasingly large networks, inflating training and deployment costs. Motivated by recent advances in inference-time scaling for generative modeling, we propose Training-Time and Inference-Time Scalable Discriminative Source Separation (TISDiSS), a unified framework that integrates early-split multi-loss supervision, shared-parameter design, and dynamic inference repetitions. TISDiSS enables flexible speed-performance trade-offs by adjusting inference depth without retraining additional models. We further provide systematic analyses of architectural and training choices and show that training with more inference repetitions improves shallow-inference performance, benefiting low-latency applications. Experiments on standard speech separation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a reduced parameter count, establishing TISDiSS as a scalable and practical framework for adaptive source separation.

Title: Compose Yourself: Average-Velocity Flow Matching for One-Step Speech Enhancement
Authors: Gang Yang, Yue Lei, Wenxin Tai, Jin Wu, Jia Chen, Ting Zhong, Fan Zhou
Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching (FM) models have achieved remarkable progress in speech enhancement (SE), yet their dependence on multi-step generation is computationally expensive and vulnerable to discretization errors. Recent advances in one-step generative modeling, particularly MeanFlow, provide a promising alternative by reformulating dynamics through average velocity fields. In this work, we present COSE, a one-step FM framework tailored for SE. To address the high training overhead of Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computations in MeanFlow, we introduce a velocity composition identity to compute average velocity efficiently, eliminating expensive computation while preserving theoretical consistency and achieving competitive enhancement quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that COSE delivers up to 5x faster sampling and reduces training cost by 40%, all without compromising speech quality.
