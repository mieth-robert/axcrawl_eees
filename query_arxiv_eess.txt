Title: Flatten Wisely: How Patch Order Shapes Mamba-Powered Vision for MRI Segmentation
Authors: Osama Hardan, Omar Elshenhabi, Tamer Khattab, Mohamed Mabrok
Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

This study presents an optimized DeepLabV3-based segmentation pipeline that incorporates automated threshold fine-tuning to improve segmentation accuracy. By refining preprocessing steps and implementing parameter optimization, we achieved a Dice Score of 0.78, an IoU of 0.70, and a Pixel Accuracy of 0.95 on ultrasound nerve imaging. The results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models and highlight the importance of tailored parameter selection in automated nerve detection.

Title: Domain-randomized deep learning for neuroimage analysis
Authors: Malte Hoffmann
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation, and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or machine learning knowledge.

Title: Joint Motion, Angle, and Range Estimation in Near-Field under Array Calibration Imperfections
Authors: Ahmed Hussain, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil
Abstract: Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (UM-MIMO) leverages large antenna arrays at high frequencies, transitioning communication paradigm into the radiative near-field (NF), where spherical wavefronts enable full-vector estimation of both target location and velocity. However, location and motion parameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint estimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the angle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at the target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range. Similarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true radial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the transverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a low-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and velocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed method enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion parameters. Simulation results demonstrate a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of -40 dB for location and velocity estimates compared to maximum likelihood estimation, while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Title: Passive Body-Area Electrostatic Field (Human Body Capacitance) for Ubiquitous Computing
Authors: Sizhen Bian, Mengxi Liu, Paul Lukowicz
Abstract: Passive body-area electrostatic field sensing, also referred to as human body capacitance (HBC), is an energy-efficient and non-intrusive sensing modality that exploits the human body's inherent electrostatic properties to perceive human behaviors. This paper presents a focused overview of passive HBC sensing, including its underlying principles, historical evolution, hardware architectures, and applications across research domains. Key challenges, such as susceptibility to environmental variation, are discussed to trigger mitigation techniques. Future research opportunities in sensor fusion and hardware enhancement are highlighted. To support continued innovation, this work provides open-source resources and aims to empower researchers and developers to leverage passive electrostatic sensing for next-generation wearable and ambient intelligence systems.

Title: Space Shift Keying-Enabled ISAC for Efficient Debris Detection and Communication in LEO Satellite Networks
Authors: Gedeon Ghislain Nkwewo Ngoufo, Khaled Humadi, Elham Baladi, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: The proliferation of space debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) presents critical challenges for orbital safety, particularly for satellite constellations. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide a promising dual function solution by enabling both environmental sensing and data communication. This study explores the use of space shift keying (SSK) modulation within ISAC frameworks, evaluating its performance when combined with sinusoidal and chirp radar waveforms. SSK is particularly attractive due to its low hardware complexity and robust communication performance. Our results demonstrate that both waveforms achieve comparable bit error rate (BER) performance under SSK, validating its effectiveness for ISAC applications. However, waveform selection significantly affects sensing capability: while the sinusoidal waveform supports simpler implementation, its high ambiguity limits range detection. In contrast, the chirp waveform enables range estimation and provides a modest improvement in velocity detection accuracy. These findings highlight the strength of SSK as a modulation scheme for ISAC and emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate waveforms to optimize sensing accuracy without compromising communication performance. This insight supports the design of efficient and scalable ISAC systems for space applications, particularly in the context of orbital debris monitoring.

Title: Heatwave-driven air conditioning adoption could increase German electricity demand by 14 GW in the near future
Authors: Leo Semmelmann, Frederik vom Scheidt
Abstract: Intensifying heatwaves driven by climate change are accelerating the adoption of mobile air conditioning (AC) systems. A rapid mass adoption of such AC systems could create additional stress on electricity grids and the power system. This study presents a novel method to estimate the electricity demand from AC systems both at system level and at high temporal and spatial granularity. We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 14 GW (23%), with urban hot-spots reaching 5.8 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges. Our findings underscore the urgency for proactive energy system planning to manage emerging demand peaks.

Title: Sensing and Stopping Interfering Secondary Users: Validation of an Efficient Spectrum Sharing System
Authors: Meles Weldegebriel, Zihan Li, Dustin Maas, Greg Hellbourg, Ning Zhang, Neal Patwari
Abstract: We present the design and validation of Stoppable Secondary Use (StopSec), a privacy-preserving protocol with the capability to identify a secondary user (SU) causing interference to a primary user (PU) and to act quickly to stop the interference. All users are served by a database that provides a feedback mechanism from a PU to an interfering SU. We introduce a new lightweight and robust method to watermark an SU's OFDM packet. Through extensive over-the-air real-time experiments, we evaluate StopSec in terms of interference detection, identification, and stopping latency, as well as impact on SUs. We show that the watermarking method avoids negative impact to the secondary data link and is robust to real-world time-varying channels. Interfering SUs can be stopped in under 150 milliseconds, and when multiple users are simultaneously interfering, they can all be stopped. Even when the interference is 10 dB lower than the noise power, StopSec successfully stops interfering SUs within a few seconds of their appearance in the channel. StopSec can be an effective spectrum sharing protocol for cases when interference to a PU must be quickly and automatically stopped.

Title: BreastSegNet: Multi-label Segmentation of Breast MRI
Authors: Qihang Li, Jichen Yang, Yaqian Chen, Yuwen Chen, Hanxue Gu, Lars J. Grimm, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist. Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet, UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone, with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data at a later date.

Title: MD-OFDM: An Energy-Efficient and Low-PAPR MIMO-OFDM Variant for Resource-Constrained Applications
Authors: Rahul Gulia
Abstract: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) combined with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques forms the backbone of modern wireless communication systems. While offering high spectral efficiency and robustness, conventional MIMO-OFDM, especially with complex equalizers like Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), suffers from high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and significant power consumption due to multiple active Radio Frequency (RF) chains. This paper proposes and mathematically models an alternative system, termed Multi-Dimensional OFDM (MD-OFDM), which employs a per-subcarrier transmit antenna selection strategy. By activating only one transmit antenna for each subcarrier, MD-OFDM aims to reduce PAPR, lower power consumption, and improve Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. We provide detailed mathematical formulations for BER, Energy Efficiency (EE), and PAPR, and discuss the suitability of MD-OFDM for various applications, particularly in energy-constrained and cost-sensitive scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Simulation results demonstrate that MD-OFDM achieves superior BER and significantly lower PAPR compared to MMSE MIMO, albeit with a trade-off in peak overall energy efficiency due to reduced spectral multiplexing.

Title: Unifying Listener Scoring Scales: Comparison Learning Framework for Speech Quality Assessment and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Cheng-Hung Hu, Yusuke Yasud, Akifumi Yoshimoto, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition (CSER) are two key tasks in speech technology, both relying on listener ratings. However, these ratings are inherently biased due to individual listener factors. Previous approaches have introduced a mean listener scoring scale and modeled all listener scoring scales in the training set. However, the mean listener approach is prone to distortion from averaging ordinal data, leading to potential biases. Moreover, learning multiple listener scoring scales while inferring based only on the mean listener scale limits effectiveness. In contrast, our method focuses on modeling a unified listener scoring scale, using comparison scores to correctly capture the scoring relationships between utterances. Experimental results show that our method effectively improves prediction performance in both SQA and CSER tasks, proving its effectiveness and robustness.

Title: Towards channel foundation models (CFMs): Motivations, methodologies and opportunities
Authors: Jun Jiang, Yuan Gao, Xinyi Wu, Shugong Xu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.

Title: Spacecraft Safe Robust Control Using Implicit Neural Representation for Geometrically Complex Targets in Proximity Operations
Authors: Hang Zhou, Tao Meng, Kun Wang, Chengrui Shi, Renhao Mao, Weijia Wang, Jiakun Lei
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of ensuring safe spacecraft proximity operations, focusing on collision avoidance between a chaser spacecraft and a complex-geometry target spacecraft under disturbances. To ensure safety in such scenarios, a safe robust control framework is proposed that leverages implicit neural representations. To handle arbitrary target geometries without explicit modeling, a neural signed distance function (SDF) is learned from point cloud data via a enhanced implicit geometric regularization method, which incorporates an over-apporximation strategy to create a conservative, safety-prioritized boundary. The target's surface is implicitly defined by the zero-level set of the learned neural SDF, while the values and gradients provide critical information for safety controller design. This neural SDF representation underpins a two-layer hierarchcial safe robust control framework: a safe velocity generation layer and a safe robust controller layer. In the first layer, a second-order cone program is formulated to generate safety-guaranteed reference velocity by explicitly incorporating the under-approximation error bound. Furthermore, a circulation inequality is introduced to mitigate the local minimum issues commonly encountered in control barrier function (CBF) methods. The second layer features an integrated disturbance observer and a smooth safety filter explicitly compensating for estimation error, bolstering robustness to external disturbances. Extensive numerical simulations and Monte Carlo analysis validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significantly improved safety margins and avoidance of local minima compared to conventional CBF approaches.

Title: Minimum Clustering of Matrices Based on Phase Alignment
Authors: Honghao Wu, Kemi Ding, Li Qiu
Abstract: Coordinating multi-agent systems requires balancing synchronization performance and controller implementation costs. To this end, we classify agents by their intrinsic properties, enabling each group to be controlled by a uniform controller and thus reducing the number of unique controller types required. Existing centralized control methods, despite their capability to achieve high synchronization performance with fewer types of controllers, suffer from critical drawbacks such as limited scalability and vulnerability to single points of failure. On the other hand, distributed control strategies, where controllers are typically agent-dependent, result in the type of required controllers increasing proportionally with the size of the system. This paper introduces a novel phase-alignment-based framework to minimize the type of controllers by strategically clustering agents with aligned synchronization behaviors. Leveraging the intrinsic phase properties of complex matrices, we formulate a constrained clustering problem and propose a hierarchical optimization method combining recursive exact searches for small-scale systems and scalable stochastic approximations for large-scale networks. This work bridges theoretical phase analysis with practical control synthesis, offering a cost-effective solution for large-scale multi-agent systems. The theoretical results applied for the analysis of a 50-agent network illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Robust Probability Hypothesis Density Filtering: Theory and Algorithms
Authors: Ming Lei, Shufan Wu
Abstract: Multi-target tracking (MTT) serves as a cornerstone technology in information fusion, yet faces significant challenges in robustness and efficiency when dealing with model uncertainties, clutter interference, and target interactions. Conventional approaches like Gaussian Mixture PHD (GM-PHD) and Cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filters suffer from inherent limitations including combinatorial explosion, sensitivity to birth/death process parameters, and numerical instability. This study proposes an innovative minimax robust PHD filtering framework with four key contributions: (1) A theoretically derived robust GM-PHD recursion algorithm that achieves optimal worst-case error control under bounded uncertainties; (2) An adaptive real-time parameter adjustment mechanism ensuring stability and error bounds; (3) A generalized heavy-tailed measurement likelihood function maintaining polynomial computational complexity; (4) A novel partition-based credibility weighting method for extended targets. The research not only establishes rigorous convergence guarantees and proves the uniqueness of PHD solutions, but also verifies algorithmic equivalence with standard GM-PHD. Experimental results demonstrate that in high-clutter environments, this method achieves a remarkable 32.4% reduction in OSPA error and 25.3% lower cardinality RMSE compared to existing techniques, while maintaining real-time processing capability at 15.3 milliseconds per step. This breakthrough lays a crucial foundation for reliable MTT in safety-critical applications.

Title: ISAC: From Human to Environmental Sensing
Authors: Kai Wu, Zhongqin Wang, Shu-Lin Chen, J. Andrew Zhang, Y. Jay Guo
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is poised to become one of the defining capabilities of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications systems, enabling the network infrastructure to jointly support high-throughput communications and situational awareness. While recent advances have explored ISAC for both human-centric applications and environmental monitoring, existing research remains fragmented across these domains. This paper provides the first unified review of ISAC-enabled sensing for both human activities and environment, focusing on signal-level mechanisms, sensing features, and real-world feasibility. We begin by characterising how diverse physical phenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood dynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures in channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A comprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing applications including localisation, activity recognition, and vital sign monitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water level. Experimental results from Long-Term Evolution (LTE) sensing under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are incorporated to highlight the feasibility in infrastructure-limited scenarios. Open challenges in signal fusion, domain adaptation, and generalisable sensing architectures are discussed to facilitate future research toward scalable and autonomous ISAC.

Title: Converting T1-weighted MRI from 3T to 7T quality using deep learning
Authors: Malo Gicquel, Ruoyi Zhao, Anika Wuestefeld, Nicola Spotorno, Olof Strandberg, Kalle Åström, Yu Xiao, Laura EM Wisse, Danielle van Westen, Rik Ossenkoppele, Niklas Mattsson-Carlgren, David Berron, Oskar Hansson, Gabrielle Flood, Jacob Vogel
Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172 participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models: a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art 3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use cases, and limitations are discussed.

Title: Simulation for Noncontact Radar-Based Physiological Sensing Using Depth-Camera-Derived Human 3D Model with Electromagnetic Scattering Analysis
Authors: Kimitaka Sumi, Takuya Sakamoto
Abstract: This study proposes a method for simulating signals received by frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar during respiratory monitoring, using human body geometry and displacement data acquired via a depth camera. Unlike previous studies that rely on simplified models of body geometry or displacement, the proposed approach models high-frequency scattering centers based on realistic depth-camera-measured body shapes and motions. Experiments were conducted with six participants under varying conditions, including varying target distances, seating orientations, and radar types, with simultaneous acquisition from the radar and depth camera. Relative to conventional model-based methods, the proposed technique achieved improvements of 7.5%, 58.2%, and 3.2% in the correlation coefficients of radar images, displacements, and spectrograms, respectively. This work contributes to the generation of radar-based physiological datasets through simulation and enhances our understanding of factors affecting the accuracy of non-contact sensing.

Title: On two fundamental properties of the zeros of spectrograms of noisy signals
Authors: Arnaud Poinas, Rémi Bardenet
Abstract: The spatial distribution of the zeros of the spectrogram is significantly altered when a signal is added to white Gaussian noise. The zeros tend to delineate the support of the signal, and deterministic structures form in the presence of interference, as if the zeros were trapped. While sophisticated methods have been proposed to detect signals as holes in the pattern of spectrogram zeros, few formal arguments have been made to support the delineation and trapping effects. Through detailed computations for simple toy signals, we show that two basic mathematical arguments, the intensity of zeros and Rouché's theorem, allow discussing delineation and trapping, and the influence of parameters like the signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, interfering chirps, even nearly superimposed, yield an easy-to-detect deterministic structure among zeros.

Title: Safe and Performant Controller Synthesis using Gradient-based Model Predictive Control and Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Aditya Singh, Aastha Mishra, Manan Tayal, Shishir Kolathaya, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: Ensuring both performance and safety is critical for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments. While safety filters such as Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce constraints by modifying nominal controllers in real time, they can become overly conservative when the nominal policy lacks safety awareness. Conversely, solving State-Constrained Optimal Control Problems (SC-OCPs) via dynamic programming offers formal guarantees but is intractable in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) with CBF-based safety filtering for co-optimizing safety and performance. In the first stage, we relax safety constraints as penalties in the cost function, enabling fast optimization via gradient-based methods. This step improves scalability and avoids feasibility issues associated with hard constraints. In the second stage, we modify the resulting controller using a CBF-based Quadratic Program (CBF-QP), which enforces hard safety constraints with minimal deviation from the reference. Our approach yields controllers that are both performant and provably safe. We validate the proposed framework on two case studies, showcasing its ability to synthesize scalable, safe, and high-performance controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.

Title: Fixed time convergence guarantees for Higher Order Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Janani S K, Shishir Kolathaya
Abstract: We present a novel method for designing higher-order Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that guarantee convergence to a safe set within a user-specified finite. Traditional Higher Order CBFs (HOCBFs) ensure asymptotic safety but lack mechanisms for fixed-time convergence, which is critical in time-sensitive and safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation. In contrast, our approach imposes a structured differential constraint using repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial, enabling closed-form polynomial solutions with exact convergence at a prescribed time. We derive conditions on the barrier function and its derivatives that ensure forward invariance and fixed-time reachability, and we provide an explicit formulation for second-order systems. Our method is evaluated on three robotic systems - a point-mass model, a unicycle, and a bicycle model and benchmarked against existing HOCBF approaches. Results demonstrate that our formulation reliably enforces convergence within the desired time, even when traditional methods fail. This work provides a tractable and robust framework for real-time control with provable finite-time safety guarantees.

Abstract: We have developed a novel CT image analysis package named AnatomyArchive, built on top of the recent full body segmentation model TotalSegmentator. It provides automatic target volume selection and deselection capabilities according to user-configured anatomies for volumetric upper- and lower-bounds. It has a knowledge graph-based and time efficient tool for anatomy segmentation mask management and medical image database maintenance. AnatomyArchive enables automatic body volume cropping, as well as automatic arm-detection and exclusion, for more precise body composition analysis in both 2D and 3D formats. It provides robust voxel-based radiomic feature extraction, feature visualization, and an integrated toolchain for statistical tests and analysis. A python-based GPU-accelerated nearly photo-realistic segmentation-integrated composite cinematic rendering is also included. We present here its software architecture design, illustrate its workflow and working principle of algorithms as well provide a few examples on how the software can be used to assist development of modern machine learning models. Open-source codes will be released at this https URL for only research and educational purposes.

Title: A Robust Periodic Controller for Spacecraft Attitude Tracking
Authors: Frederik Thiele, Felix Biertümpfel, Harald Pfifer
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for robust periodic attitude control of satellites. Respecting the periodicity of the satellite dynamics in the synthesis allows to achieve constant performance and robustness requirements over the orbit. The proposed design follows a mixed sensitivity control design employing a physically motivated weighting scheme. The controller is calculated using a novel structured linear time-periodic output feedback synthesis with guaranteed optimal L2-performance. The synthesis poses a convex optimization problem and avoids grid-wise evaluations of coupling conditions inherent for classical periodic H-infinity-synthesis. Moreover, the controller has a transparent and easy to implement structure. A solar power plant satellite is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for periodic satellite attitude control.

Title: Blind Super Resolution with Reference Images and Implicit Degradation Representation
Authors: Huu-Phu Do, Po-Chih Hu, Hao-Chien Hsueh, Che-Kai Liu, Vu-Hoang Tran, Ching-Chun Huang
Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels. By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

Title: Identifiability Analysis of a Pseudo-Two-Dimensional Model & Single Particle Model-Aided Parameter Estimation
Authors: L.D. Couto, K. Haghverdi, F. Guo, K. Trad, G. Mulder
Abstract: This contribution presents a parameter identification methodology for the accurate and fast estimation of model parameters in a pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) battery model. The methodology consists of three key elements. First, the data for identification is inspected and specific features herein that need to be captured are included in the model. Second, the P2D model is analyzed to assess the identifiability of the physical model parameters and propose alternative parameterizations that alleviate possible issues. Finally, diverse operating conditions are considered that excite distinct battery dynamics which allows the use of different low-order battery models accordingly. Results show that, under low current conditions, the use of low-order models achieve parameter estimates at least 500 times faster than using the P2D model at the expense of twice the error. However, if accuracy is a must, these estimated parameters can be used to initialize the P2D model and perform the identification in half of the time.

Title: Device-Free Localization Using Commercial UWB Transceivers
Authors: Hyun Seok Lee
Abstract: Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs. However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best performance with reasonable computational costs.

Title: Leveraging Pathology Foundation Models for Panoptic Segmentation of Melanoma in H&E Images
Authors: Jiaqi Lv, Yijie Zhu, Carmen Guadalupe Colin Tenorio, Brinder Singh Chohan, Mark Eastwood, Shan E Ahmed Raza
Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps. The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability. Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational pathology workflows.

Title: Diffraction and Scattering Modeling for Laser Power Beaming in Lunar Environment
Authors: Yanni Jiwan-Mercier, Barış Dönmez, Güneş Karabulut-Kurt, Sébastien Loranger
Abstract: Reliable energy delivery is a critical requirement for long-term lunar missions, particularly in regions with limited solar access, such as polar craters and during extended lunar nights. Optical Power Beaming (OPB) using high-power lasers offers a promising alternative to conventional solar power, but the effects of suspended lunar dust on beam propagation remain poorly understood. This study introduces a detailed simulation model that incorporates both diffraction and height-dependent scattering by the electrostatically suspended lunar regolith. Un like prior approaches, which assumed uniform dust layers or center-to-center transmission loss, our model uses generalized diffraction theory and refractive index gradients derived from particle density to assess beam deformation and attenuation. The results show that even in ground-to-ground scenarios, lunar dust significantly degrades energy transfer efficiency, dropping from 57% to 3.7% over 50 km in dust-free vs. dusty conditions with 175 nm particles. Increasing the particle size to 250 nm limits the viable transmission range to below 30 km at 6% efficiency. The study further demonstrates that raising the laser source height can improve efficiency, achieving 91% for a distance of 5 km and 25% at 50 km when the source is positioned 12 m above ground. These findings underscore the importance of system elevation and dust modeling in lunar OPB design and reveal the mission-critical role of particle size distribution, especially in environments disturbed by human activity.

Title: OrthoInsight: Rib Fracture Diagnosis and Report Generation Based on Multi-Modal Large Models
Authors: Ningyong Wu, Jinzhi Wang, Wenhong Zhao, Chenzhan Yu, Zhigang Xiu, Duwei Dai
Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.

Title: Smart fault detection in satellite electrical power system
Authors: Niloofar Nobahari, Alireza Rezaee
Abstract: This paper presents an new approach for detecting in the electrical power system of satellites operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) without an Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS). Components of these systems are prone to faults, such as line-to-line faults in the photovoltaic subsystem, open circuits, and short circuits in the DC-to-DC converter, as well as ground faults in batteries. In the previous research has largely focused on detecting faults in each components, such as photovoltaic arrays or converter systems, therefore, has been limited attention given to whole electrical power system of satellite as a whole system. Our approach addresses this gap by utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model, which leverages input data such as solar radiation and surface temperature to predict current and load outputs. These machine learning techniques that classifiy use different approaches like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to classify faults effectively. The model presented achieves over 99% accuracy in identifying faults across multiple subsystems, marking a notable advancement from previous approaches by offering a complete diagnostic solution for the entire satellite power system. This thorough method boosts system reliability and helps lower the chances of mission failure

Title: Distortion-Aware Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Zeyuan Zhang, Yue Xiu, Phee Lep Yeoh, Guangyi Liu, Zixing Wu, Ning Wei
Abstract: This paper investigates a practical partially-connected hybrid beamforming transmitter for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with distortion from nonlinear power amplification. For this ISAC system, we formulate a communication rate and sensing mutual information maximization problem driven by our distortion-aware hybrid beamforming design. To address this non-convex problem, we first solve for a fully digital beamforming matrix by alternatively solving three sub-problems using manifold optimization (MO) and our derived closed-form solutions. The analog and digital beamforming matrices are then obtained through a decomposition algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve overall ISAC performance compared to traditional beamforming methods.

Title: Influence of Cell Position on the Capacity of Retired Batteries: Experimental and Statistical Studies
Authors: Marwan Hassini, Colette Mintsa-Eya, Eduardo Redondo-Iglesias, Pascal Venet
Abstract: Understanding how batteries perform after automotive use is crucial to determining their potential for reuse. This article presents experimental results aimed at advancing knowledge of retired battery performance. Three modules extracted from electric vehicles were tested. Their performance was assessed, and the results were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 36 retired cells exhibited a high level of performance, albeit with significant variation. On average, the cells had a 95% state of health capacity with a dispersion of 2.4%. ANOVA analysis suggests that cell performance is not correlated with their position inside the module. These results demonstrate the need to evaluate dispersion within retired batteries and to develop thermal management and balancing systems for second-life batteries.

Title: Reference-Free Iterative Learning Model Predictive Control with Neural Certificates
Authors: Wataru Hashimoto, Kazumune Hashimoto, Masako Kishida, Shigemasa Takai
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reference-free iterative learning model predictive control (MPC). In the proposed method, a certificate function based on the concept of Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (CLBF) is learned using data collected from past control executions and used to define the terminal set and cost in the MPC optimization problem at the current iteration. This scheme enables the progressive refinement of the MPC's terminal components over successive iterations. Unlike existing methods that rely on mixed-integer programming and suffer from numerical difficulties, the proposed approach formulates the MPC optimization problem as a standard nonlinear program, enabling more efficient online computation. The proposed method satisfies key MPC properties, including recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. Additionally, we demonstrate that the performance cost is non-increasing with respect to the number of iterations, under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments including the simulation with PyBullet confirm that our control scheme iteratively enhances control performance and significantly improves online computational efficiency compared to the existing methods.

Title: Toward Practical Fluid Antenna Systems: Co-Optimizing Hardware and Software for Port Selection and Beamforming
Authors: Sai Xu, Kai-Kit Wong, Yanan Du, Hanjiang Hong, Chan-Byoung Chae, Baiyang Liu, Kin-Fai Tong
Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-software co-design approach to efficiently optimize beamforming and port selection in fluid antenna systems (FASs). To begin with, a fluid-antenna (FA)-enabled downlink multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network is modeled, and a weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated. Second, a method that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with random port selection (RPS) is proposed to jointly optimize beamforming and port selection, while also assessing the benefits and limitations of random selection. Third, an instruction-driven deep learning accelerator based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is developed to minimize inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, a scheduling algorithm is introduced to reduce redundant computations and minimize the idle time of computing cores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GNN-RPS approach achieves competitive communication performance. Furthermore, experimental evaluations indicate that the FPGA-based accelerator maintains low latency while simultaneously executing beamforming inference for multiple port selections.

Title: TGIF: Talker Group-Informed Familiarization of Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Tsun-An Hsieh, Minje Kim
Abstract: State-of-the-art target speaker extraction (TSE) systems are typically designed to generalize to any given mixing environment, necessitating a model with a large enough capacity as a generalist. Personalized speech enhancement could be a specialized solution that adapts to single-user scenarios, but it overlooks the practical need for customization in cases where only a small number of talkers are involved, e.g., TSE for a specific family. We address this gap with the proposed concept, talker group-informed familiarization (TGIF) of TSE, where the TSE system specializes in a particular group of users, which is challenging due to the inherent absence of a clean speech target. To this end, we employ a knowledge distillation approach, where a group-specific student model learns from the pseudo-clean targets generated by a large teacher model. This tailors the student model to effectively extract the target speaker from the particular talker group while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline generic models by adapting to the unique speech characteristics of a given speaker group. Our newly proposed TGIF concept underscores the potential of developing specialized solutions for diverse and real-world applications, such as on-device TSE on a family-owned device.

Title: D2IP: Deep Dynamic Image Prior for 3D Time-sequence Pulmonary Impedance Imaging
Authors: Hao Fang, Hao Yu, Sihao Teng, Tao Zhang, Siyi Yuan, Huaiwu He, Zhe Liu, Yunjie Yang
Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT) reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster), highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

Title: Physics-guided gated recurrent units for inversion-based feedforward control
Authors: Mingdao Lin, Max Bolderman, Mircea Lazar
Abstract: Inversion-based feedforward control relies on an accurate model that describes the inverse system dynamics. The gated recurrent unit (GRU), which is a recent architecture in recurrent neural networks, is a strong candidate for obtaining such a model from data. However, due to their black-box nature, GRUs face challenges such as limited interpretability and vulnerability to overfitting. Recently, physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs) have been introduced, which integrate the prior physical model structure into the prediction process. This approach not only improves training convergence, but also facilitates the learning of a physics-based model. In this work, we integrate a GRU in the PGNN framework to obtain a PG-GRU, based on which we adopt a two-step approach to feedforward control design. First, we adopt stable inversion techniques to design a stable linear model of the inverse dynamics. Then, a GRU trained on the residual is tailored to inverse system identification. The resulting PG-GRU feedforward controller is validated by means of real-life experiments on a two-mass spring-damper system, where it demonstrates roughly a two-fold improvement compared to the linear feedforward and a preview-based GRU feedforward in terms of the integral absolute error.

Title: Convex computation of regions of attraction from data using Sums-of-Squares programming
Authors: Oumayma Khattabi, Matteo Tacchi-Bénard, Sorin Olaru
Abstract: The paper concentrates on the analysis of the region of attraction (ROA) for unknown autonomous dynamical systems. The aim is to explore a data-driven approach based on moment-sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, which enables novel RoA outer approximations despite the reduced information on the structure of the dynamics. The main contribution of this work is bypassing the system model and, consequently, the recurring constraint on its polynomial structure. Numerical experimentation showcases the influence of data on learned approximating sets, offering a promising outlook on the potential of this method.

Title: UGPL: Uncertainty-Guided Progressive Learning for Evidence-Based Classification in Computed Tomography
Authors: Shravan Venkatraman, Pavan Kumar S, Rakesh Raj Madavan, Chandrakala S
Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive learning pipeline is implemented.

Title: Integrating Forecasting Models Within Steady-State Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Aayushya Agarwal, Larry Pileggi
Abstract: Extreme weather variations and the increasing unpredictability of load behavior make it difficult to determine power grid dispatches that are robust to uncertainties. While machine learning (ML) methods have improved the ability to model uncertainty caused by loads and renewables, accurately integrating these forecasts and their sensitivities into steady-state analyses and decision-making strategies remains an open challenge. Toward this goal, we present a generalized methodology that seamlessly embeds ML-based forecasting engines within physics-based power flow and grid optimization tools. By coupling physics-based grid modeling with black-box ML methods, we accurately capture the behavior and sensitivity of loads and weather events by directly integrating the inputs and outputs of trained ML forecasting models into the numerical methods of power flow and grid optimization. Without fitting surrogate load models, our approach obtains the sensitivities directly from data to accurately predict the response of forecasted devices to changes in the grid. Our approach combines the sensitivities of forecasted devices attained via backpropagation and the sensitivities of physics-defined grid devices. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by showcasing improvements in sensitivity calculations and leveraging them to design a robust power dispatch that improves grid reliability under stochastic weather events. Our approach enables the computation of system sensitivities to exogenous factors which supports broader analyses that improve grid reliability in the presence of load variability and extreme weather conditions.

Title: Feature-based analysis of oral narratives from Afrikaans and isiXhosa children
Authors: Emma Sharratt, Annelien Smith, Retief Louw, Daleen Klop, Febe de Wet, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development. This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency, with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Title: PGR-DRC: Pre-Global Routing DRC Violation Prediction Using Unsupervised Learning
Authors: Riadul Islam, Dhandeep Challagundla
Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network (NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset (in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy, respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to 6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.

Title: A Novel APVD Steganography Technique Incorporating Pseudorandom Pixel Selection for Robust Image Security
Authors: Mehrab Hosain, Rajiv Kapoor
Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective, encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of the image.

Title: From Binary to Semantic: Utilizing Large-Scale Binary Occupancy Data for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction
Authors: Chihiro Noguchi, Takaki Yamamoto
Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and (2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Title: Model-free Reinforcement Learning for Model-based Control: Towards Safe, Interpretable and Sample-efficient Agents
Authors: Thomas Banker, Ali Mesbah
Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions, while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents -- exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies, along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored, motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

Title: Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Environmental Monitoring, and Newtonian Noise Mitigation:Comparable Sensitivity to Seismometers
Authors: Reinhardt Rading, Fracensca Badaracco, Spiridon Beis, Katharina Sophie Isleif, Paul Ophardt, Wanda Vossius, the WAVE Collaboration
Abstract: Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

Title: Human-Like Trajectories Generation via Receding Horizon Tracking Applied to the TickTacking Interface
Authors: Daniele Masti, Stefano Menchetti, Çağrı Erdem, Giorgio Gnecco, Davide Rocchesso
Abstract: TickTacking is a rhythm-based interface that allows users to control a pointer in a two-dimensional space through dual-button tapping. This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration

Title: Single spin exact gradients for the optimization of complex pulses and pulse sequences
Authors: Stella Slad, Burkhard Luy
Abstract: The efficient computer optimization of magnetic resonance pulses and pulse sequences involves the calculation of a problem-adapted cost function as well as its gradients with respect to all controls applied. The gradients generally can be calculated as a finite difference approximation, as a GRAPE approximation, or as an exact function, e.g. by the use of the augmented matrix exponentiation, where the exact gradient should lead to best optimization convergence. However, calculation of exact gradients is computationally expensive and analytical exact solutions to the problem would be highly desirable. As the majority of todays pulse optimizations involve a single spin 1/2, which can be represented by simple rotation matrices in the Bloch space or by their corresponding Cayley-Klein/quaternion parameters, the derivations of analytical exact gradient functions appear to be feasible. Taking two optimization types, the optimization of point-to-point pulses using 3D-rotations and the optimization of universal rotation pulses using quaternions, analytical solutions for gradients with respect to controls have been derived. Controls in this case can be conventional $x$ and $y$ pulses, but also $z$-controls, as well as gradients with respect to amplitude and phase of a pulse shape. In addition, analytical solutions with respect to pseudo controls, involving holonomic constraints to maximum rf-amplitudes, maximum rf-power, or maximum rf-energy, are introduced. Using the hyperbolic tangent function, maximum values are imposed in a fully continuous and differentiable way. The obtained analytical gradients allow the calculation two orders of magnitude faster than the augmented matrix exponential approach. The exact gradients for different controls are finally compared in a number of optimizations involving broadband pulses for $^{15}$N, $^{13}$C, and $^{19}$F applications.

This paper introduces Balalaika, a novel dataset comprising more than 2,000 hours of studio-quality Russian speech with comprehensive textual annotations, including punctuation and stress markings. Experimental results show that models trained on Balalaika significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both speech synthesis and enhancement tasks. We detail the dataset construction pipeline, annotation methodology, and results of comparative evaluations.

Title: Temporal Adaptation of Pre-trained Foundation Models for Music Structure Analysis
Authors: Yixiao Zhang, Haonan Chen, Ju-Chiang Wang, Jitong Chen
Abstract: Audio-based music structure analysis (MSA) is an essential task in Music Information Retrieval that remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of musical form. Recent advances highlight the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2) low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and inference speed.

Title: Conformal Contraction for Robust Nonlinear Control with Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification
Authors: Sihang Wei, Melkior Ornik, Hiroyasu Tsukamoto
Abstract: We present a novel robust control framework for continuous-time, perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty that depends nonlinearly on both the state and control inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that impose structural assumptions on the uncertainty, our framework enhances contraction-based robust control with data-driven uncertainty prediction, remaining agnostic to the models of the uncertainty and predictor. We statistically quantify how reliably the contraction conditions are satisfied under dynamics with uncertainty via conformal prediction, thereby obtaining a distribution-free and finite-time probabilistic guarantee for exponential boundedness of the trajectory tracking error. We further propose the probabilistically robust control invariant (PRCI) tube for distributionally robust motion planning, within which the perturbed system trajectories are guaranteed to stay with a finite probability, without explicit knowledge of the uncertainty model. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed robust control framework and the performance of the PRCI tube.

Title: Safe Robotic Capsule Cleaning with Integrated Transpupillary and Intraocular Optical Coherence Tomography
Authors: Yu-Ting Lai, Yasamin Foroutani, Aya Barzelay, Tsu-Chin Tsao
Abstract: Secondary cataract is one of the most common complications of vision loss due to the proliferation of residual lens materials that naturally grow on the lens capsule after cataract surgery. A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.

Title: CARTS: Cooperative and Adaptive Resource Triggering and Stitching for 5G ISAC
Authors: Cheng Jiang, Yihe Yan, Yanxiang Wang, Jiawei Hu, Chun Tung Chou, Wen Hu
Abstract: This paper presents CARTS, an adaptive 5G uplink sensing scheme designed to provide Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) services. The performance of both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of accurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks, uplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base station implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information streams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby increasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to more users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching and compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS and SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a real-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently uncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing opportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS significantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE) of 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of users as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance. By opportunistically combining DMRS and SRS, CARTS therefore provides a practical, standard-compliant solution to improve CSI availability for ISAC without requiring additional radio resources.

Title: Tackling fake images in cybersecurity -- Interpretation of a StyleGAN and lifting its black-box
Authors: Julia Laubmann, Johannes Reschke
Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework, enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context of digital deception and cybercrime.

Title: Nonlinear Distortion Equalization in Multi-Span Optical Links Via a Feed-Forward Photonic Neural Network
Authors: Emiliano Staffoli, Elisabetta Ferri, Stefano Gretter, Lorenzo Pavesi
Abstract: Linear and nonlinear distortions in optical communication signals are equalized using an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN). The PNN is based on a linear stage made of an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, featuring tunable amplitude and phase weights at each tap, and of a nonlinear stage achieved through the square modulus operation at the end-of-line photodetector. Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection (IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2) optical signals undergoing multi-span propagation. Each 50 km segment includes fiber transmission, optical power restoration, and optional chromatic dispersion compensation via a Tunable Dispersion Compensator. Positioned at the receiver, the PNN enables fully optical signal processing with minimal latency and power consumption. Experimental validation is conducted using a Silicon-On-Insulator device operating on 10 Gbps signals. It demonstrates chromatic dispersion equalization over distances up to 200 km and self-phase modulation (with dispersion removed) up to 450 km.

Title: A Quantum-assisted Attention U-Net for Building Segmentation over Tunis using Sentinel-1 Data
Authors: Luigi Russo, Francesco Mauro, Babak Memar, Alessandro Sebastianelli, Silvia Liberata Ullo, Paolo Gamba
Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery, proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters. This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation in urban environments.

Title: Resource-Splitting Games with Tullock-Based Lossy Contests
Authors: Marko Maljkovic, Gustav Nilsson, Nikolas Geroliminis
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of multi-stage resource allocation games that model real-world scenarios in which profitability depends on the balance between supply and demand, and where higher resource investment leads to greater returns. Our proposed framework, which incorporates the notion of profit loss due to insufficient player participation, gives rise to a Tullock-like functional form of the stage payoff structure when weighted fair proportional resource allocation is applied. We explore both centralized and Nash equilibrium strategies, establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness, and provide an iterative, semi-decentralized method to compute the Nash equilibrium in games with arbitrarily many players. Additionally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes instances of several existing models, including Receding Horizon and Blotto games, and present a semi-analytical method for computing the unique Nash equilibrium within the Blotto setup. Our findings are validated through a numerical case study in smart mobility, highlighting the practical relevance and applicability of the proposed model.

Title: Controlling the Parameterized Multi-channel Wiener Filter using a tiny neural network
Authors: Eric Grinstein, Ashutosh Pandey, Cole Li, Shanmukha Srinivas, Juan Azcarreta, Jacob Donley, Sanha Lee, Ali Aroudi, Cagdas Bilen
Abstract: Noise suppression and speech distortion are two important aspects to be balanced when designing multi-channel Speech Enhancement (SE) algorithms. Although neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art noise suppression, their non-linear operations often introduce high speech distortion. Conversely, classical signal processing algorithms such as the Parameterized Multi-channel Wiener Filter ( PMWF) beamformer offer explicit mechanisms for controlling the suppression/distortion trade-off. In this work, we present NeuralPMWF, a system where the PMWF is entirely controlled using a low-latency, low-compute neural network, resulting in a low-complexity system offering high noise reduction and low speech distortion. Experimental results show that our proposed approach results in significantly better perceptual and objective speech enhancement in comparison to several competitive baselines using similar computational resources.

Title: Safety Certification in the Latent space using Control Barrier Functions and World Models
Authors: Mehul Anand, Shishir Kolathaya
Abstract: Synthesising safe controllers from visual data typically requires extensive supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data, while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent dynamics modelling.

Title: Optimizing ASR for Catalan-Spanish Code-Switching: A Comparative Analysis of Methodologies
Authors: Carlos Mena, Pol Serra, Jacobo Romero, Abir Messaoudi, Jose Giraldo, Carme Armentano-Oller, Rodolfo Zevallos, Ivan Meza, Javier Hernando
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS, widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face. Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

Title: On the Trade-Off Between Sum-Rate and Energy Efficiency through the Convergence of HAPS and Active RIS Technologies
Authors: Bilal Karaman, Ilhan Basturk, Ferdi Kara, Metin Ozturk, Sezai Taskin, Halil Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) relay with high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) to enhance non-terrestrial network (NTN) performance in next-generation wireless systems. While prior studies focused on passive RIS architectures, the severe path loss and double fading in long-distance HAPS links make active RIS a more suitable alternative due to its inherent signal amplification capabilities. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem to jointly optimize power allocation and RIS element assignment for ground user equipments (UEs) supported by a HAPS-based active RIS-assisted communication system. To reduce power consumption and hardware complexity, several sub-connected active RIS architectures are also explored. Simulation results reveal that active RIS configurations significantly outperform passive RIS in terms of quality of service (QoS). Moreover, although fully-connected architectures achieve the highest throughput, sub-connected schemes demonstrate superior energy efficiency under practical power constraints. These findings highlight the potential of active RIS-enabled HAPS systems to meet the growing demands of beyond-cellular coverage and green networking.

Title: Convergent transformations of visual representation in brains and models
Authors: Pablo Marcos-Manchón, Lluís Fuentemilla
Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

Title: Open Automatic Speech Recognition Models for Classical and Modern Standard Arabic
Authors: Lilit Grigoryan, Nikolay Karpov, Enas Albasiri, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other, the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we open-source the models and their training recipes.

Title: Hybrid Integration of Quantum Cascade Lasers with Germanium-on-Silicon waveguides for Mid-Infrared Sensing Applications
Authors: Colin J. Mitchell, Longqi Zhou, Ke Li, Daniel Adeyemi, Ahmed Osman, Milos Nedeljkovic, Glenn Churchill, James C. Gates, Graham T. Reed, Kristian M. Groom, Jon Heffernan, Goran Mashanovich
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for hybrid integration of quantum cascade laser bars with germanium-on-silicon waveguides operating in the mid-infrared. The laser bars are flip-chip bonded onto a germanium-on-silicon target chip without active alignment, acheiving end-fire coupling efficiency of up to 45% (3.5 dB loss) in pulsed operation. Optical power estimates indicate 20-30 mW coupled into the waveguides. The passive alignment approach, combined with a CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuit fabrication process, offers a scalable pathway to fully integrated mid-infrared photonic systems for sensing, free-space communications, and the realisation of novel light sources.

Title: Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian process regression
Authors: Xu Zhang, Zhenyuan Yuan, Minghui Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR. Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

Title: An Adversarial-Driven Experimental Study on Deep Learning for RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Xinyu Cao, Bimal Adhikari, Shangqing Zhao, Jingxian Wu, Yanjun Pan
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.

Title: OpenBEATs: A Fully Open-Source General-Purpose Audio Encoder
Authors: Shikhar Bharadwaj, Samuele Cornell, Kwanghee Choi, Satoru Fukayama, Hye-jin Shim, Soham Deshmukh, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Masked token prediction has emerged as a powerful pre-training objective across language, vision, and speech, offering the potential to unify these diverse modalities through a single pre-training task. However, its application for general audio understanding remains underexplored, with BEATs being the only notable example. BEATs has seen limited modifications due to the absence of open-source pre-training code. Furthermore, BEATs was trained only on AudioSet, restricting its broader downstream applicability. To address these gaps, we present OpenBEATs, an open-source framework that extends BEATs via multi-domain audio pre-training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six types of tasks, twenty five datasets, and three audio domains, including audio reasoning tasks such as audio question answering, entailment, and captioning. OpenBEATs achieves state-of-the-art performance on six bioacoustics datasets, two environmental sound datasets and five reasoning datasets, performing better than models exceeding a billion parameters at one-fourth their parameter size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-domain datasets and masked token prediction task to learn general-purpose audio representations. To promote further research and reproducibility, we release all pre-training and evaluation code, pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, and training logs at this https URL

Title: Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction
Authors: Xinyi Yu, Yiqi Zhao, Xiang Yin, Lars Lindemann
Abstract: The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.

Title: Large-Vocabulary Segmentation for Medical Images with Text Prompts
Authors: Ziheng Zhao, Yao Zhang, Chaoyi Wu, Xiaoman Zhang, Xiao Zhou, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie
Abstract: This paper aims to build a model that can Segment Anything in 3D medical images, driven by medical terminologies as Text prompts, termed as SAT. Our main contributions are three-fold: (i) We construct the first multimodal knowledge tree on human anatomy, including 6502 anatomical terminologies; Then, we build the largest and most comprehensive segmentation dataset for training, collecting over 22K 3D scans from 72 datasets, across 497 classes, with careful standardization on both image and label space; (ii) We propose to inject medical knowledge into a text encoder via contrastive learning and formulate a large-vocabulary segmentation model that can be prompted by medical terminologies in text form; (iii) We train SAT-Nano (110M parameters) and SAT-Pro (447M parameters). SAT-Pro achieves comparable performance to 72 nnU-Nets -- the strongest specialist models trained on each dataset (over 2.2B parameters combined) -- over 497 categories. Compared with the interactive approach MedSAM, SAT-Pro consistently outperforms across all 7 human body regions with +7.1% average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) improvement, while showing enhanced scalability and robustness. On 2 external (cross-center) datasets, SAT-Pro achieves higher performance than all baselines (+3.7% average DSC), demonstrating superior generalization ability.

Title: A Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve AI-based computational pathology prediction performance under variable levels of histopathology image blur
Authors: Yujie Xiang, Bojing Liu, Mattias Rantalainen
Abstract: AI-based models for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis are increasingly common, but unsharp or blurred areas within WSI can significantly reduce prediction performance. In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.

Title: A lightweight and robust method for blind wideband-to-fullband extension of speech
Authors: Jan Büthe, Jean-Marc Valin
Abstract: Reducing the bandwidth of speech is common practice in resource constrained environments like low-bandwidth speech transmission or low-complexity vocoding. We propose a lightweight and robust method for extending the bandwidth of wideband speech signals that is inspired by classical methods developed in the speech coding context. The resulting model has just ~370K parameters and a complexity of ~140 MFLOPS (or ~70 MMACS). With a frame size of 10 ms and a lookahead of only 0.27 ms, the model is well-suited for use with common wideband speech codecs. We evaluate the model's robustness by pairing it with the Opus SILK speech codec (1.5 release) and verify in a P.808 DCR listening test that it significantly improves quality from 6 to 12 kb/s. We also demonstrate that Opus 1.5 together with the proposed bandwidth extension at 9 kb/s meets the quality of 3GPP EVS at 9.6 kb/s and that of Opus 1.4 at 18 kb/s showing that the blind bandwidth extension can meet the quality of classical guided bandwidth extensions thus providing a way for backward-compatible quality improvement.

Title: Reducing real-time complexity via sub-control Lyapunov functions: from theory to experiments
Authors: Huu-Thinh Do, Franco Blanchini, Stefano Miani, Ionela Prodan
Abstract: The techniques to design control Lyapunov functions (CLF), along with a proper stabilizing feedback, possibly in the presence of constraints, often provide control laws that are too complex for proper implementation online, especially when an optimization problem is involved. In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then a SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.

Title: Revisiting Data Augmentation for Ultrasound Images
Authors: Adam Tupper, Christian Gagné
Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used and effective technique to improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Yet, despite often facing limited data availability when working with medical images, it is frequently underutilized. This appears to come from a gap in our collective understanding of the efficacy of different augmentation techniques across different tasks and modalities. One modality where this is especially true is ultrasound imaging. This work addresses this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques at improving model performance across a wide range of ultrasound image analysis tasks. To achieve this, we introduce a new standardized benchmark of 14 ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks from 10 different sources and covering 11 body regions. Our results demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on natural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than augmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases. We also show that diverse augmentation using TrivialAugment, which is widely used for natural images, is also effective for ultrasound images. Moreover, our proposed methodology represents a structured approach for assessing various data augmentations that can be applied to other contexts and modalities.

Title: Solving Optimal Power Flow on a Data-Budget: Feature Selection on Smart Meter Data
Authors: Vassilis Kekatos, Ridley Annin, Manish K. Singh, Junjie Qin
Abstract: How much data is needed to optimally schedule distributed energy resources (DERs)? Does the distribution system operator (DSO) have to know load demands at each bus of the feeder to solve an optimal power flow (OPF)? This work exploits redundancies in OPF's structure and data to minimize the communication of such a data deluge, and explores the trade-off between data compression and the grid's performance. We propose an OPF data distillation framework involving two steps: The DSO first collects OPF data from only a subset of nodes. It subsequently reconstructs the complete OPF data from the partial ones, and feeds them into the OPF solver. Selecting and reconstructing OPF data may be performed to maximize the fidelity of the reconstructed data or the associated OPF solutions. Under the first objective, OPF data distillation is posed as a sparsity-regularized convex problem. Under the second objective, it is posed as a sparsity-regularized bilevel program. Both problems are solved using proximal gradient algorithms. The second objective is superior in approximating OPF solutions at the expense of increased complexity. Numerical tests show that it enhances the fidelity and feasibility of the reconstructed OPF solutions, which can be approximated reasonably well even from partial data.

Title: Algorithm Design and Prototype Validation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surface: Forward-Only Transmission
Authors: Cheng Luo, Luping Xiang, Jie Hu, Kun Yang
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.

Title: Cyber Insurance Design for Load Variation and Load Curtailment in Distribution Grids
Authors: Shijie Pan, Zaint A. Alexakis, S Subhash Lakshminarayana, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte-Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE-118 test bus system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeders model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.

Title: Discrete-time Two-Layered Forgetting RLS Identification under Finite Excitation
Authors: Satoshi Tsuruhara, Kazuhisa Ito
Abstract: In recent years, adaptive identification methods that can achieve the true value convergence of parameters without requiring persistent excitation (PE) have been widely studied, and concurrent learning has been intensively studied. However, the parameter convergence rate is limited for the gradient-based method owing to small parameter update gain, and even the introduction of forgetting factors does not work sufficiently. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel discrete-time recursive least squares method under finite excitation (FE) conditions using two forgetting factors (inner and outer) and an augmented regressor matrix comprising a sum of regressor vectors. The proposed method ensures the PE condition of the augmented regressor matrix under FE conditions of the regressor vector and allows the properly design of the forgetting factor without estimator windup and/or destabilization of the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with several conventional methods.

Title: Memory-less and Backscatter-less Tunnel Diode Harmonic Signatures for RFID
Authors: Christopher Saetia, Kaitlyn Graves, Serhat Tadik, Gregory D. Durgin
Abstract: Tunnel diodes have traditionally been researched for extending backscatter read-ranges for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags as reflection amplifiers. This paper explores the natural harmonics that arise from biasing these diodes within their negative differential resistance regions and with no interrogating signal from a transmitting source, such as an RFID reader, to injection-lock these diodes. These harmonics are characterized for five tunnel diode boards, made with the same components and with each board's fundamental frequencies measuring at above -15 dBm at a biasing voltage of 200 mV when measured over-the-cable. The occurrence of these harmonics creates unique harmonic signatures for each board and demonstrates possible harmonic RFID applications that can help RFID readers discover and even identify RFID tags with backscatter-less and memory-less IDs generated by tunnel diodes.

Title: Zak-OTFS with Spread Carrier Waveforms
Authors: Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. As a consequence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS pulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR (only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and delay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on the discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that achieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus reducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS achieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB lower PAPR per basis element. We demonstrate uncoded bit error rate (BER) similar to pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, and improved BER performance over competing methods based on OFDM and OTFS in high mobility & delay spread environments.

Title: Exposing and Mitigating Calibration Biases and Demographic Unfairness in MLLM Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Xing Shen, Justin Szeto, Mingyang Li, Hengguan Huang, Tal Arbel
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Title: Inverse Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography
Authors: Matthew A. Chan, Casey J. Pellizzari, Christopher A. Metzler
Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

Title: Incremental Averaging Method to Improve Graph-Based Time-Difference-of-Arrival Estimation
Authors: Klaus Brümann, Kouei Yamaoka, Nobutaka Ono, Simon Doclo
Abstract: Estimating the position of a speech source based on time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background noise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation.

Title: Precoded Zak-OTFS for Per-Carrier Equalization
Authors: Saif Khan Mohammed, Amit Kumar Pathak, Muhammad Ubadah, Ronny Hadani, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. The image of the scattering environment changes slowly, making it possible to employ precoding at the transmitter. Precoding techniques were developed more than thirty years ago for wireline modem channels (V.34 standard) defined by linear convolution where a pulse in the time domain (TD) is used to probe the one-dimensional partial response channel. The action of a doubly spread channel on Zak-OTFS modulation determines a two-dimensional partial response channel defined by twisted convolution, and we develop a novel precoding technique for this channel. The proposed precoder leads to separate equalization of each DD carrier which has significantly lower complexity than joint equalization of all carriers. Further, the effective precoded channel results in non-interfering DD carriers which significantly reduces the overhead of guard carriers separating data and pilot carriers, which improves the spectral efficiency significantly.

Abstract: With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads, losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv) thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making, ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.

Title: Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS
Authors: Sandesh Rao Mattu, Nishant Mehrotra, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically, albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols. Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower complexity.

Title: Beamforming Tradeoff for Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free MIMO
Authors: Xi Ding, Luca Kunz, E. Jorswieck
Abstract: This paper studies optimal joint beamforming (BF) for joint sensing and communication (JSAC) in small-scale cell-free MIMO (CF-MIMO) systems. While prior works have explored JSAC optimization using methods such as successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR), many of these approaches either lack global optimality or require additional rank-reduction steps. In contrast, we propose an SDR-based optimization framework that guarantees globally optimal solutions without post-processing. To benchmark its performance, we introduce a standalone BF strategy that dedicates each access point (AP) exclusively to either communication or sensing. The proposed formulation builds upon a general multi-user system model, enabling future extensions beyond the single-user setting. Overall, our framework offers a globally optimal and computationally efficient BF design, providing valuable insights for the development of next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Equivalent and Compact Representations of Neural Network Controllers With Decision Trees
Authors: Kevin Chang, Nathan Dahlin, Rahul Jain, Pierluigi Nuzzo
Abstract: Over the past decade, neural network (NN)-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a variety of decision-making tasks. However, their black-box nature and the risk of unexpected behaviors pose a challenge to their deployment in real-world systems requiring strong guarantees of correctness and safety. We address these limitations by investigating the transformation of NN-based controllers into equivalent soft decision tree (SDT)-based controllers and its impact on verifiability. In contrast to existing work, we focus on discrete-output NN controllers including rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions as well as argmax operations. We then devise an exact yet efficient transformation algorithm which automatically prunes redundant branches. We first demonstrate the practical efficacy of the transformation algorithm applied to an autonomous driving NN controller within OpenAI Gym's CarRacing environment. Subsequently, we evaluate our approach using two benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym environment. Our results indicate that the SDT transformation can benefit formal verification, showing runtime improvements of up to $21 \times$ and $2 \times$ for MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v1, respectively.

Title: Interpretable Imitation Learning via Generative Adversarial STL Inference and Control
Authors: Wenliang Liu, Danyang Li, Erfan Aasi, Daniela Rus, Roberto Tron, Calin Belta
Abstract: Imitation learning methods have demonstrated considerable success in teaching autonomous systems complex tasks through expert demonstrations. However, a limitation of these methods is their lack of interpretability, particularly in understanding the specific task the learning agent aims to accomplish. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning method that combines Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference and control synthesis, enabling the explicit representation of the task as an STL formula. This approach not only provides a clear understanding of the task but also supports the integration of human knowledge and allows for adaptation to out-of-distribution scenarios by manually adjusting the STL formulas and fine-tuning the policy. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-inspired approach to train both the inference and policy networks, effectively narrowing the gap between expert and learned policies. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, showcasing its practical applicability and adaptability.

Title: Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning
Authors: Yixiao Zhang, Yukara Ikemiya, Woosung Choi, Naoki Murata, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Liwei Lin, Gus Xia, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Yuki Mitsufuji, Simon Dixon
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.

Title: Policy Verification in Stochastic Dynamical Systems Using Logarithmic Neural Certificates
Authors: Thom Badings, Wietze Koops, Sebastian Junges, Nils Jansen
Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for discrete-time stochastic systems with respect to reach-avoid specifications. We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.

Title: Design and Optimization of a Metamaterial Absorber for Solar Energy Harvesting in the THz Frequency Range
Authors: Nafisa Anjum, Alok Kumar Paul
Abstract: This paper introduces the design and comprehensive characterization of a novel three-layer metamaterial absorber, engineered to exploit the unique optical properties of gold, vanadium dioxide, and silicon dioxide. At the core of this design, silicon dioxide serves as a robust substrate that supports an intricately structured layer of gold and a top layer of vanadium dioxide. This configuration is optimized to harness and enhance absorption capabilities effectively across a broadband terahertz (THz) spectrum. The absorber demonstrates an extensive absorption bandwidth of 3.00 THz, spanning frequencies from 2.414 THz to 5.417 THz. Remarkably, throughout this range, the device maintains a consistently high absorption efficiency, exceeding 90%. This efficiency is characterized by two sharp absorption peaks located at 2.638 THz and 5.158 THz, which signify the precise tuning of the metamaterial structure to interact optimally with specific THz frequencies. The absorbance of the proposed model is almost equal to 99%. This absorber is polarization insensitive. The development of this absorber involved a series of theoretical simulations backed by experimental validations, which helped refine the metamaterial's geometry and material composition. This process illuminated the critical role of the dielectric properties of silicon dioxide and the plasmonic effects induced by gold and vanadium dioxide layers, which collectively contribute to the high-performance metrics observed.

Title: Towards Practical Operation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents in Real-World Network Management at Open RAN Edges
Authors: Haiyuan Li, Hari Madhukumar, Peizheng Li, Yuelin Liu, Yiran Teng, Yulei Wu, Ning Wang, Shuangyi Yan, Dimitra Simeonidou
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

Title: Stonefish: Supporting Machine Learning Research in Marine Robotics
Authors: Michele Grimaldi, Patryk Cieslak, Eduardo Ochoa, Vibhav Bharti, Hayat Rajani, Ignacio Carlucho, Maria Koskinopoulou, Yvan R. Petillot, Nuno Gracias
Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.

Title: Chance-constrained Linear Quadratic Gaussian Games for Multi-robot Interaction under Uncertainty
Authors: Kai Ren, Giulio Salizzoni, Mustafa Emre Gürsoy, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: We address safe multi-robot interaction under uncertainty. In particular, we formulate a chance-constrained linear quadratic Gaussian game with coupling constraints and system uncertainties. We find a tractable reformulation of the game and propose a dual ascent algorithm. We prove that the algorithm converges to a feedback generalized Nash equilibrium of the reformulated game, ensuring the satisfaction of the chance constraints. We test our method in driving simulations and real-world robot experiments. Our method ensures safety under uncertainty and generates less conservative trajectories than single-agent model predictive control.

Title: Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking
Authors: Bum Geun Park, Taeho Lee, Donghwan Lee
Abstract: This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.

Title: Align Your Rhythm: Generating Highly Aligned Dance Poses with Gating-Enhanced Rhythm-Aware Feature Representation
Authors: Congyi Fan, Jian Guan, Xuanjia Zhao, Dongli Xu, Youtian Lin, Tong Ye, Pengming Feng, Haiwei Pan
Abstract: Automatically generating natural, diverse and rhythmic human dance movements driven by music is vital for virtual reality and film industries. However, generating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing methods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating mechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance generation, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic sensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to precisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on the intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we propose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic features, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We also introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately model upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby improving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive experiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity. Project page: this https URL .

Title: Source Separation by Flow Matching
Authors: Robin Scheibler, John R. Hershey, Arnaud Doucet, Henry Li
Abstract: We consider the problem of single-channel audio source separation with the goal of reconstructing $K$ sources from their mixture. We address this ill-posed problem with FLOSS (FLOw matching for Source Separation), a constrained generation method based on flow matching, ensuring strict mixture consistency. Flow matching is a general methodology that, when given samples from two probability distributions defined on the same space, learns an ordinary differential equation to output a sample from one of the distributions when provided with a sample from the other. In our context, we have access to samples from the joint distribution of $K$ sources and so the corresponding samples from the lower-dimensional distribution of their mixture. To apply flow matching, we augment these mixture samples with artificial noise components to match the dimensionality of the $K$ source distribution. Additionally, as any permutation of the sources yields the same mixture, we adopt an equivariant formulation of flow matching which relies on a neural network architecture that is equivariant by design. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the separation of overlapping speech.

Title: SpecMaskFoley: Steering Pretrained Spectral Masked Generative Transformer Toward Synchronized Video-to-audio Synthesis via ControlNet
Authors: Zhi Zhong, Akira Takahashi, Shuyang Cui, Keisuke Toyama, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

Title: MuteSwap: Visual-informed Silent Video Identity Conversion
Authors: Yifan Liu, Yu Fang, Zhouhan Lin
Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Title: Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases
Authors: Mihails Milehins, Dan Marghitu
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.

Title: Automatically assessing oral narratives of Afrikaans and isiXhosa children
Authors: Retief Louw, Emma Sharratt, Febe de Wet, Christiaan Jacobs, Annelien Smith, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases, but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for children's learning.
