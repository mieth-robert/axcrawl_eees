Title: Stochastic Economic Dispatch with Battery Energy Storage considering Wind and Load Uncertainty
Authors: Shishir Lamichhane, Anamika Dubey
Abstract: With the integration of renewable energy resources in power systems, managing operational flexibility and reliability while minimizing operational costs has become increasingly challenging. Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a promising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact of BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load uncertainties is captured, with scenarios generated using a method inspired by stratified and importance sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, where selected conventional generators are converted to wind power plants. Case studies show that strategic BESS deployment significantly improves system flexibility by reducing renewable curtailments and dispatch costs. Renewable energy curtailments decrease upon increasing BESS size and approach zero depending on wind penetration level. Higher wind penetrations result in greater curtailments without storage and yield larger cost savings when BESS is deployed, highlighting the growing need for flexibility as renewable energy penetrations increase.

Title: Reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold
Authors: Svyatoslav Covanov, Cedric Pradalier
Abstract: This work introduces an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its primary objective is to provide a methodology enabling the evaluation of the precision of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary accuracy on synthetic data, something that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed in prior work. To this end, we develop a new filter that exhibits favorable numerical properties, thereby correcting the divergences observed in previous Kalman filter variants. In this formulation, the achievable precision is no longer constrained by the small-velocity assumption and is determined solely by sensor noise. In addition, this new filter assumes high precision on the sensors, which, in real scenarios require a detection step that we define heuristically, allowing one to extend this approach to scenarios, using either a 9-axis IMU or a combination of odometry, accelerometer, and pressure sensors. The latter configuration is designed for the reconstruction of trajectories in underwater environments.

Title: Automated Analysis of Naturalistic Recordings in Early Childhood: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities
Authors: Jialu Li, Marvin Lavechin, Xulin Fan, Nancy L. McElwain, Alejandrina Cristia, Paola Garcia-Perera, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson
Abstract: Naturalistic recordings capture audio in real-world environments where participants behave naturally without interference from researchers or experimental protocols. Naturalistic long-form recordings extend this concept by capturing spontaneous and continuous interactions over extended periods, often spanning hours or even days, in participants' daily lives. Naturalistic recordings have been extensively used to study children's behaviors, including how they interact with others in their environment, in the fields of psychology, education, cognitive science, and clinical research. These recordings provide an unobtrusive way to observe children in real-world settings beyond controlled and constrained experimental environments. Advancements in speech technology and machine learning have provided an initial step for researchers to automatically and systematically analyze large-scale naturalistic recordings of children. Despite the imperfect accuracy of machine learning models, these tools still offer valuable opportunities to uncover important insights into children's cognitive and social development. Several critical speech technologies involved include speaker diarization, vocalization classification, word count estimate from adults, speaker verification, and language diarization for code-switching. Most of these technologies have been primarily developed for adults, and speech technologies applied to children specifically are still vastly under-explored. To fill this gap, we discuss current progress, challenges, and opportunities in advancing these technologies to analyze naturalistic recordings of children during early development (<3 years of age). We strive to inspire the signal processing community and foster interdisciplinary collaborations to further develop this emerging technology and address its unique challenges and opportunities.

Title: Fully Distributed State Estimation for Multi-agent Systems and its Application in Cooperative Localization
Authors: Shuaiting Huang, Haodong Jiang, Chengcheng Zhao, Peng Cheng, Junfeng Wu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributed state estimation problem for a continuous-time linear multi-agent system (MAS) composed of $\mathit{m}$ agents and monitored by the agents themselves. To address this problem, we propose a distributed observer that enables each agent to reconstruct the state of the MAS. The main idea is to let each agent $\mathit{i}$ recover the state of agent $\mathit{j}$ by using leader-follower consensus rules to track agent $\mathit{j}$'s state estimate, which is generated by agent $\mathit{j}$ itself using a Luenberger-like estimation rule. Under the assumptions of node-level observability and topological ordering consistency, we show that the estimation error dynamics are stabilizable if and only if the communication graph is strongly connected. Moreover, we discuss the fully distributed design of the proposed observer, assuming that the agents only know basic MAS configuration information, such as the homogeneity and the maximum number of allowable agents. This design ensures that the proposed observer functions correctly when agents are added or removed. Building on this, we consider cooperative localization as a distributed estimation problem and develop two fully distributed localization algorithms that allow agents to track their own and other agents' positions (and velocities) within the MAS. Finally, we conduct simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed theoretical results.

Title: On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection
Authors: Bahar Kor, Bipin Gaikwad, Abani Patra, Eric L. Miller
Abstract: We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.

Title: On the Dynamics of Acceleration in First order Gradient Methods
Authors: M Parimi, Rachit Mehra, S.R. Wagh, Amol Yerudkar, Navdeep Singh
Abstract: Ever since the original algorithm by Nesterov (1983), the true nature of the acceleration phenomenon has remained elusive, with various interpretations of why the method is actually faster. The diagnosis of the algorithm through the lens of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and the corresponding dynamical system formulation to explain the underlying dynamics has a rich history. In the literature, the ODEs that explain algorithms are typically derived by considering the limiting case of the algorithm maps themselves, that is, an ODE formulation follows the development of an algorithm. This obfuscates the underlying higher order principles and thus provides little evidence of the working of the algorithm. Such has been the case with Nesterov algorithm and the various analogies used to describe the acceleration phenomena, viz, momentum associated with the rolling of a Heavy-Ball down a slope, Hessian damping etc. The main focus of our work is to ideate the genesis of the Nesterov algorithm from the viewpoint of dynamical systems leading to demystifying the mathematical rigour behind the algorithm. Instead of reverse engineering ODEs from discrete algorithms, this work explores tools from the recently developed control paradigm titled Passivity and Immersion approach and the Geometric Singular Perturbation theory which are applied to arrive at the formulation of a dynamical system that explains and models the acceleration phenomena. This perspective helps to gain insights into the various terms present and the sequence of steps used in Nesterovs accelerated algorithm for the smooth strongly convex and the convex case. The framework can also be extended to derive the acceleration achieved using the triple momentum method and provides justifications for the non-convergence to the optimal solution in the Heavy-Ball method.

Title: Optimal Service Mode Assignment in a Simple Computation Offloading System: Extended Version
Authors: Darin Jeff, Eytan Modiano
Abstract: We consider a simple computation offloading model where jobs can either be fully processed in the cloud or be partially processed at a local server before being sent to the cloud to complete processing. Our goal is to design a policy for assigning jobs to service modes, i.e., full offloading or partial offloading, based on the state of the system, in order to minimize delay in the system. We show that when the cloud server is idle, the optimal policy is to assign the next job in the system queue to the cloud for processing. However, when the cloud server is busy, we show that, under mild assumptions, the optimal policy is of a threshold type, that sends the next job in the system queue to the local server if the queue exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, we demonstrate this policy structure through simulations.

Title: Policy Gradient with Self-Attention for Model-Free Distributed Nonlinear Multi-Agent Games
Authors: Eduardo Sebastián, Maitrayee Keskar, Eeman Iqbal, Eduardo Montijano, Carlos Sagüés, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: Multi-agent games in dynamic nonlinear settings are challenging due to the time-varying interactions among the agents and the non-stationarity of the (potential) Nash equilibria. In this paper we consider model-free games, where agent transitions and costs are observed without knowledge of the transition and cost functions that generate them. We propose a policy gradient approach to learn distributed policies that follow the communication structure in multi-team games, with multiple agents per team. Our formulation is inspired by the structure of distributed policies in linear quadratic games, which take the form of time-varying linear feedback gains. In the nonlinear case, we model the policies as nonlinear feedback gains, parameterized by self-attention layers to account for the time-varying multi-agent communication topology. We demonstrate that our distributed policy gradient approach achieves strong performance in several settings, including distributed linear and nonlinear regulation, and simulated and real multi-robot pursuit-and-evasion games.

Title: Multi-Target Detection for Cognitive MIMO Radar Networks
Authors: Nicholas L.K. Goradia, Harpreet S. Dhillon, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: In this work, we develop centralized and decentralized signal fusion techniques for constant false alarm rate (CFAR) multi-target detection with a cognitive radar network in unknown noise and clutter distributions. Further, we first develop a detection statistic for co-located monostatic MIMO radar in unknown noise and clutter distributions which is asymptotically CFAR as the number of received pulses over all antennas grows large, and we provide conditions under which this detection statistic is valid. We leverage reinforcement learning (RL) for improved multi-target detection performance, where the radar learns likely target locations in a search area. These results are then generalized to the setting of cognitive radar networks, where radars collaborate to learn where targets are likely to appear in a search area. We show a fundamental tradeoff between the spatial and temporal domain for CFAR detection in unknown noise and clutter distributions; in other words, we show a tradeoff between the number of radar antennas and the number of temporal samples. We show the benefits and tradeoffs with centralized and decentralized detection with a network of cognitive radars.

Title: Measurement Score-Based MRI Reconstruction with Automatic Coil Sensitivity Estimation
Authors: Tingjun Liu, Chicago Y. Park, Yuyang Hu, Hongyu An, Ulugbek S. Kamilov
Abstract: Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have recently shown outstanding performance in compressed-sensing parallel MRI reconstruction by combining diffusion priors with physical measurement models. However, they typically rely on pre-calibrated coil sensitivity maps (CSMs) and ground truth images, making them often impractical: CSMs are difficult to estimate accurately under heavy undersampling and ground-truth images are often unavailable. We propose Calibration-free Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (C-MSM), a new method that eliminates these dependencies by jointly performing automatic CSM estimation and self-supervised learning of measurement scores directly from k-space data. C-MSM reconstructs images by approximating the full posterior distribution through stochastic sampling over partial measurement posterior scores, while simultaneously estimating CSMs. Experiments on the multi-coil brain fastMRI dataset show that C-MSM achieves reconstruction performance close to DIS with clean diffusion priors -- even without access to clean training data and pre-calibrated CSMs.

Title: Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration
Authors: Ziad Hatab, Michael Ernst Gadringer, Arash Arsanjani, Wolfgang Boesch
Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.

Title: Compositional System Dynamics: The Higher Mathematics Underlying System Dynamics Diagrams & Practice
Authors: Xiaoyan Li, Evan Patterson, Patricia L. Mabry, Nathaniel D. Osgood
Abstract: This work establishes a robust mathematical foundation for compositional System Dynamics modeling, leveraging category theory to formalize and enhance the representation, analysis, and composition of system models. Here, System Dynamics diagrams, such as stock & flow diagrams, system structure diagrams, and causal loop diagrams, are formulated as categorical constructs, enabling scalable, transparent, and systematic reasoning. By encoding these diagrams as data using attributed C-sets and utilizing advanced categorical tools like structured cospans, pushouts, pullbacks, and functor mappings, the framework supports modular composition, stratification, and seamless mapping between syntax and semantics. The approach underwrites traditional practice with firm mathematical structure, facilitates the identification of certain forms of pathways and feedback loops, the detection of simple patterns within complex diagrams, common structure between diagrams, and structure-preserving mappings between diverse diagram types. Additionally, this framework supports alternative semantics, such as stochastic transition dynamics, extending beyond traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) representations. Applications in compositional modeling, modularity, and team-based collaboration demonstrate the practical advantages of this advanced framework. Future directions include integrating dimensional annotations, supporting hybrid and agent-based modeling paradigms, and expanding the framework's applicability to global and local temporal reasoning through temporal sheaves. By revealing and formalizing the hidden mathematical structure of System Dynamics diagrams, this work empowers practitioners to tackle complex systems with clarity, scalability, and rigor.

Title: Refined Barrier Conditions for Finite-Time Safety and Reach-Avoid Guarantees in Stochastic Systems
Authors: Bai Xue, Luke Ong, Dominik Wagner, Peixin Wang
Abstract: Providing finite-time probabilistic safety and reach-avoid guarantees is crucial for safety-critical stochastic systems. Existing barrier certificate methods often rely on a restrictive boundedness assumption for auxiliary functions, limiting their applicability. This paper presents refined barrier-like conditions that remove this assumption. Specifically, we establish conditions for deriving upper bounds on finite-time safety probabilities in discrete-time systems and lower bounds on finite-time reach-avoid probabilities in continuous-time systems. This key relaxation significantly expands the class of verifiable systems, especially those with unbounded state spaces, and facilitates the application of advanced optimization techniques, such as semi-definite programming with polynomial functions. The efficacy of our approach is validated through numerical examples.

Title: AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network: An Embodied, Communication-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for 6G Coverage
Authors: Han Zeng, Haibo Wang, Luhao Fan, Bingcheng Zhu, Xiaohu You, Zaichen Zhang
Abstract: The vision of 6G communication demands autonomous and resilient networking in environments without fixed infrastructure. Yet most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches focus on isolated stages - exploration, relay formation, or access - under static deployments and centralized control, limiting adaptability. We propose the AI Agent Access (A\^3) Network, a unified, embodied intelligence-driven framework that transforms multi-agent networking into a dynamic, decentralized, and end-to-end system. Unlike prior schemes, the A\^3 Network integrates exploration, target user access, and backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, while supporting on-demand agent addition during runtime. Its decentralized policies ensure that even a single agent can operate independently with limited observations, while coordinated agents achieve scalable, communication-optimized coverage. By embedding link-level communication metrics into actor-critic learning, the A\^3 Network couples topology formation with robust decision-making. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the A\^3 Network not only balances exploration and communication efficiency but also delivers system-level adaptability absent in existing MARL frameworks, offering a new paradigm for 6G multi-agent networks.

Title: No Verifiable Reward for Prosody: Toward Preference-Guided Prosody Learning in TTS
Authors: Seungyoun Shin, Dongha Ahn, Jiwoo Kim, Sungwook Jeon
Abstract: Recent work reports gains in neural text-to-speech (TTS) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, in the absence of a verifiable reward for \textit{prosody}, GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL) lowers error rates yet collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech; adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. We address this with an \textit{iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)} scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model. On \textbf{KoCC-TTS}, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center interactions capturing task-oriented dialogues, our method attains the highest human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong commercial baselines. These results suggest that when prosody cannot be rewarded automatically, \textit{human preference optimization} offers a practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS.

Title: Efficient Breast and Ovarian Cancer Classification via ViT-Based Preprocessing and Transfer Learning
Authors: Richa Rawat, Faisal Ahmed
Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.

Title: A Secure Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Ping Wang, Zulin Wang, Yuanfang Ma, Xiaosi Tian, Yuanhan Ni
Abstract: This paper introduces a secure affine frequency division multiplexing (SE-AFDM) for wireless communication systems to enhance communication security. Besides configuring the parameter c1 to obtain communication reliability under doubly selective channels, we also utilize the time-varying parameter c2 to improve the security of the communications system. The derived input-output relation shows that the legitimate receiver can eliminate the nonlinear impact introduced by the time-varying c2 without losing the bit error rate (BER) performance. Moreover, it is theoretically proved that the eavesdropper cannot separate the time-varying c2 and random information symbols, such that the BER performance of the eavesdropper is severely deteriorated. Meanwhile, the analysis of the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the eavesdropper illustrates that the SINR decreases as the value range of c2 expands. Numerical results verify that the proposed SE-AFDM waveform has significant security while maintaining good BER performance in high-mobility scenarios.

Title: SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes
Authors: Dayun Choi, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.

Title: HarmoniFuse: A Component-Selective and Prompt-Adaptive Framework for Multi-Task Speech Language Modeling
Authors: Yuke Si, Runyan Yang, Yingying Gao, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shilei Zhang
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have facilitated the development of unified speech language models (SLMs) capable of supporting multiple speech tasks within a shared architecture. However, tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) rely on distinct types of information: ASR primarily depends on linguistic content, whereas SER requires the integration of both linguistic and paralinguistic cues. Existing multitask SLMs typically adopt naive parameter sharing or prompt-based conditioning without explicitly modeling the differences in information composition required by each task. Such designs risk task interference and performance degradation, especially under limited data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose HarmoniFuse, a component-selective and prompt-adaptive framework for multi-task speech language modeling. HarmoniFuse is designed to harmonize heterogeneous task demands by selecting and fusing task-relevant components of speech representations. Specifically, it integrates a gated speech encoder to extract task-specific acoustic features and a prompt-adaptive dynamic fusion module to aggregate transformer layers based on task characteristics. In addition, a batch-interleaved training strategy enables leveraging separate ASR and SER datasets without requiring joint annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that HarmoniFuse improves both ASR and SER performance, offering a scalable and robust solution for multitask speech understanding under realistic data constraints.

Title: Teaching Audio Models to Reason: A Unified Framework for Source- and Layer-wise Distillation
Authors: Runyan Yang, Yuke Si, Yingying Gao, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shilei Zhang
Abstract: While large audio language models excel at tasks like ASR and emotion recognition, they still struggle with complex reasoning due to the modality gap between audio and text as well as the lack of structured intermediate supervision. To address this, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a high-capacity textual teacher model to a student audio models while preserving its acoustic competence. Our method introduces two key dimensions: source-wise distillation, which leverages both textual and acoustic teachers to provide complementary modality-specific supervision; and layer-wise distillation, which aligns teacher signals with appropriate student layers to improve transfer efficiency. This dual-dimensional strategy enables fine-grained control over the distillation process, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and speech representations. Experimental results show significant improvements in audio reasoning performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework as a reasoning transfer solution for audio modeling.

Title: SynSonic: Augmenting Sound Event Detection through Text-to-Audio Diffusion ControlNet and Effective Sample Filtering
Authors: Jiarui Hai, Mounya Elhilali
Abstract: Data synthesis and augmentation are essential for Sound Event Detection (SED) due to the scarcity of temporally labeled data. While augmentation methods like SpecAugment and Mix-up can enhance model performance, they remain constrained by the diversity of existing samples. Recent generative models offer new opportunities, yet their direct application to SED is challenging due to the lack of precise temporal annotations and the risk of introducing noise through unreliable filtering. To address these challenges and enable generative-based augmentation for SED, we propose SynSonic, a data augmentation method tailored for this task. SynSonic leverages text-to-audio diffusion models guided by an energy-envelope ControlNet to generate temporally coherent sound events. A joint score filtering strategy with dual classifiers ensures sample quality, and we explore its practical integration into training pipelines. Experimental results show that SynSonic improves Polyphonic Sound Detection Scores (PSDS1 and PSDS2), enhancing both temporal localization and sound class discrimination.

Title: FlexSED: Towards Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection
Authors: Jiarui Hai, Helin Wang, Weizhe Guo, Mounya Elhilali
Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale sound event detection (SED) systems capable of handling hundreds of sound classes, existing multi-class classification frameworks remain fundamentally limited. They cannot process free-text sound queries, which enable more flexible and user-friendly interaction, and they lack zero-shot capabilities and offer poor few-shot adaptability. Although text-query-based separation methods have been explored, they primarily focus on source separation and are ill-suited for SED tasks that require precise temporal localization and efficient detection across large and diverse sound vocabularies. In this paper, we propose FlexSED, an open-vocabulary sound event detection system. FlexSED builds on a pretrained audio SSL model and the CLAP text encoder, introducing an encoder-decoder composition and an adaptive fusion strategy to enable effective continuous training from pretrained weights. To ensure robust supervision, it also employs large language models (LLMs) to assist in event query selection during training, addressing challenges related to missing labels. As a result, FlexSED achieves superior performance compared to vanilla SED models on AudioSet-Strong, while demonstrating strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. We release the code and pretrained models to support future research and applications based on FlexSED.

Title: Interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning System in Congested Traffic
Authors: Yue Zhang, Xinzhi Zhong, Soyoung Ahn, Yajie Zou, Zhengbing He
Abstract: Lane changes (LCs) in congested traffic are complex, multi-vehicle interactive events that pose significant safety concerns. Providing early warnings can enable more proactive driver assistance system and support more informed decision-making for drivers under LCs. This paper presents an interaction-aware Lane-Changing Early Warning (LCEW) system designed to issue reliable early warning signals based on future trajectory predictions. We first investigate the stochastic nature of LCs, characterized by (i) variable-size multi-vehicle interactions and (ii) the direct and indirect risks resulting from these interactions. To model these stochastic interactions, a Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework informed by mutual information (STGCNN-MI) is introduced to predict multi-vehicle trajectories. By leveraging a MI-based adjacency matrix, the framework enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while providing interpretable representations of vehicle interactions. Then, potential collisions between the LC vehicle and adjacent vehicles (direct risks) or among the non-adjacent vehicles (indirect risks) are identified using oriented bounding box detection applied to the predicted trajectories. Finally, a warning signal is generated to inform the LC driver of location of potential collisions within the predicted time window. Traffic simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate that the proposed interaction-aware LCEW improves both vehicle-level safety and overall traffic efficiency, while also promoting more natural behavioral adaptation.

Title: Dual Iterative Learning Control for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Dynamics with Validation in Robotic Systems
Authors: Jan-Hendrik Ewering, Alessandro Papa, Simon F.G. Ehlers, Thomas Seel, Michael Meindl
Abstract: Solving motion tasks autonomously and accurately is a core ability for intelligent real-world systems. To achieve genuine autonomy across multiple systems and tasks, key challenges include coping with unknown dynamics and overcoming the need for manual parameter tuning, which is especially crucial in complex Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. This paper presents MIMO Dual Iterative Learning Control (DILC), a novel data-driven iterative learning scheme for simultaneous tracking control and model learning, without requiring any prior system knowledge or manual parameter tuning. The method is designed for repetitive MIMO systems and integrates seamlessly with established iterative learning control methods. We provide monotonic convergence conditions for both reference tracking error and model error in linear time-invariant systems. The DILC scheme -- rapidly and autonomously -- solves various motion tasks in high-fidelity simulations of an industrial robot and in multiple nonlinear real-world MIMO systems, without requiring model knowledge or manually tuning the algorithm. In our experiments, many reference tracking tasks are solved within 10-20 trials, and even complex motions are learned in less than 100 iterations. We believe that, because of its rapid and autonomous learning capabilities, DILC has the potential to serve as an efficient building block within complex learning frameworks for intelligent real-world systems.

Title: Integrated Cellular and LEO-based Positioning and Synchronization under User Mobility
Authors: Yasaman Ettefagh, Sharief Saleh, Musa Furkan Keskin, Hui Chen, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: This paper investigates the localization, synchronization, and speed estimation of a mobile user equipment (UE) leveraging integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), in particular low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. We focus on a minimal setup in which the UE received signal from only one base station (BS) and one LEO satellite. We derive a generic signal model accounting for mobility, clock and frequency offsets, based on which a hierarchy of simplified models are proposed and organized by computational complexity. Estimation algorithms are developed for each model to facilitate efficient and accurate parameter recovery. Rigorous simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, demonstrating their suitability across diverse scenarios. The findings highlight how the trade-off between complexity and performance can be optimized for varying deployment environments and application requirements, offering valuable insights for 6G positioning and synchronization systems under user mobility.

Title: HyperCool: Reducing Encoding Cost in Overfitted Codecs with Hypernetworks
Authors: Pep Borrell-Tatché, Till Aczel, Théo Ladune, Roger Wattenhofer
Abstract: Overfitted image codecs like Cool-chic achieve strong compression by tailoring lightweight models to individual images, but their encoding is slow and computationally expensive. To accelerate encoding, Non-Overfitted (N-O) Cool-chic replaces the per-image optimization with a learned inference model, trading compression performance for encoding speed. We introduce HyperCool, a hypernetwork architecture that mitigates this trade-off. Building upon the N-O Cool-chic framework, HyperCool generates content-adaptive parameters for a Cool-chic decoder in a single forward pass, tailoring the decoder to the input image without requiring per-image fine-tuning. Our method achieves a 4.9% rate reduction over N-O Cool-chic with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, the output of our hypernetwork provides a strong initialization for further optimization, reducing the number of steps needed to approach fully overfitted model performance. With fine-tuning, HEVC-level compression is achieved with 60.4% of the encoding cost of the fully overfitted Cool-chic. This work proposes a practical method to accelerate encoding in overfitted image codecs, improving their viability in scenarios with tight compute budgets.

Title: An Extended Kalman Filter for Systems with Infinite-Dimensional Measurements
Authors: Maxwell M. Varley, Timothy L. Molloy, Girish N. Nair
Abstract: This article examines state estimation in discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems with finite-dimensional states and infinite-dimensional measurements, motivated by real-world applications such as vision-based localization and tracking. We develop an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for real-time state estimation, with the measurement noise modeled as an infinite-dimensional random field. When applied to vision-based state estimation, the measurement Jacobians required to implement the EKF are shown to correspond to image gradients. This result provides a novel system-theoretic justification for the use of image gradients as features for vision-based state estimation, contrasting with their (often heuristic) introduction in many computer-vision pipelines. We demonstrate the practical utility of the EKF on a public real-world dataset involving the localization of an aerial drone using video from a downward-facing monocular camera. The EKF is shown to outperform VINS-MONO, an established visual-inertial odometry algorithm, in some cases achieving mean squared error reductions of up to an order of magnitude.

Title: Detection Capability Comparison Between Intensity Detection and Splitting Detection for Rydberg-Atomic Sensors
Authors: Hao Wu, Xinyuan Yao, Rui Ni, Chen Gong, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, their unique physical characteristics enable two fundamental signal readout schemes: intensity-based detection and splitting-based detection. The former measures the electric fields through laser intensity, while the latter utilizes Autler-Townes splitting. In this work, we systematically categorize and model existing signal readout methods, classifying them into these two paradigms. Then, we derive the maximum likelihood estimation procedures and corresponding Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for each detection modality. Through the analysis of the CRLB, we propose strategy for both readout schemes to enhance sensitivity and minimize estimation variance: acquiring data in regions with maximal slope magnitudes. While this approach has been implemented in intensity-based detection (e.g., superheterodyne schemes), its application to splitting-based detection remains unexplored. Implementation of non-uniform frequency scanning, with preferential sampling at regions exhibiting maximum peak slopes combined with our proposed maximum likelihood splitting estimation method, achieves significantly reduced estimation variance compared to conventional polynomial fitting. The comparative analysis reveals the optimal detection performance of the two detection schemes. This work also contributes to enhancing the accuracy of microwave calibration. Numerical results reveal that both fundamental signal readout methods achieve lower estimation variance based on our proposed maximum likelihood estimation approach.

Title: Integration of Concentrated Solar Power Plants in Renewable-Only VPP with Electrical and Thermal Demands: A Two-Stage Robust Bidding Approach
Authors: Hadi Nemati, Pedro Sánchez-Martín, Álvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Luis Rouco
Abstract: This paper proposes the integration of Concentrated Solar Power Plant (CSP) in the Renewable-only virtual power plant (RVPP) for bidding in the electricity day-ahead and secondary reserve markets, as well as trading thermal energy through a heat purchase agreement. A reformulated two-stage robust optimization approach is introduced to account for multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, non-dispatchable renewable energy sources electrical production, CSP thermal production, and uncertainties in electrical and thermal demand consumption. The provision of energy and reserve by the thermal storage of CSP is modeled using an adjustable approach, which allocates a share of energy for up and down reserves based on the profitability of the RVPP. Simulations are conducted for several case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach under different RVPP operator decisions against uncertain parameters and various trading strategies for electricity and thermal energy. The simulation results show that integrating CSP into RVPP enhances RVPP flexibility for both electrical and thermal trading. Furthermore, the results indicate that the profitability of the RVPP increases when all trading options are considered, across different levels of conservatism adopted by the RVPP operator in response to uncertain parameters.

Title: Group Relative Policy Optimization for Text-to-Speech with Large Language Models
Authors: Chang Liu, Ya-Jun Hu, Ying-Ying Gao, Shi-Lei Zhang, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: This paper proposes a GRPO-based approach to enhance the performance of large language model (LLM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by deriving rewards from an off-the-shelf automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. Compared to previous reinforcement learning methods for LLM-based TTS, our method requires no dedicated model for reward computation or training. Moreover, we design a composite reward function that combines character error rate (CER) with negative log-likelihood (NLL) obtained from the ASR model, providing more informative and accurate reward signals. We apply GRPO fine-tuning to pre-trained LLM-based TTS models and evaluate their zero-shot TTS performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method substantially improves both the intelligibility and naturalness of synthesized speech. Ablation studies and further analyses confirm the effectiveness of integrating the two reward components.

Title: Highly Parallel Singular Value Decomposition for Low-Latency MIMO Processing
Authors: Sijia Cheng, Liang Liu, Ove Edfors, Juan Vidal Alegria
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used in wireless systems, including multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing and dimension reduction in distributed MIMO (D-MIMO). However, the iterative nature of decomposition methods results in increased execution time as system size grows, posing challenges for real-time and low-latency applications. To address this, we analyze the latency of state-of-art SVD methods, and highlight the efficiency of a 4-step highly parallel method based on Gram matrix tridiagonalization. Furthermore, we develop a time complexity (processing latency) analysis framework with hardware profiling, allowing scalable and realistic evaluation without full implementation. The numerical results demonstrate the superior time efficiency of the selected parallel method, particularly in massive MIMO scenarios.

Title: Rethinking the joint estimation of magnitude and phase for time-frequency domain neural vocoders
Authors: Lingling Dai, Andong Li, Tong Lei, Meng Yu, Xiaodong Li, Chengshi Zheng
Abstract: Time-frequency (T-F) domain-based neural vocoders have shown promising results in synthesizing high-fidelity audio. Nevertheless, it remains unclear on the mechanism of effectively predicting magnitude and phase targets jointly. In this paper, we start from two representative T-F domain vocoders, namely Vocos and APNet2, which belong to the single-stream and dual-stream modes for magnitude and phase estimation, respectively. When evaluating their performance on a large-scale dataset, we accidentally observe severe performance collapse of APNet2. To stabilize its performance, in this paper, we introduce three simple yet effective strategies, each targeting the topological space, the source space, and the output space, respectively. Specifically, we modify the architectural topology for better information exchange in the topological space, introduce prior knowledge to facilitate the generation process in the source space, and optimize the backpropagation process for parameter updates with an improved output format in the output space. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively facilitates the joint estimation of magnitude and phase in APNet2, thus bridging the performance disparities between the single-stream and dual-stream vocoders.

Title: RFI Removal from SAR Imagery via Sparse Parametric Estimation of LFM Interferences
Authors: Dehui Yang, Feng Xi, Qihao Cao, Huizhang Yang
Abstract: One of the challenges in spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is modeling and mitigating radio frequency interference (RFI) artifacts in SAR imagery. Linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals have been commonly used for characterizing the radar interferences in SAR. In this letter, we propose a new signal model that approximates RFI as a mixture of multiple LFM components in the focused SAR image domain. The azimuth and range frequency modulation (FM) rates for each LFM component are estimated effectively using a sparse parametric representation of LFM interferences with a discretized LFM dictionary. This approach is then tested within the recently developed RFI suppression framework using a 2-D SPECtral ANalysis (2-D SPECAN) algorithm through LFM focusing and notch filtering in the spectral domain [1]. Experimental studies on Sentinel-1 single-look complex images demonstrate that the proposed LFM model and sparse parametric estimation scheme outperforms existing RFI removal methods.

Title: FlashGMM: Fast Gaussian Mixture Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression
Authors: Shimon Murai, Fangzheng Lin, Jiro Katto
Abstract: High-performance learned image compression codecs require flexible probability models to fit latent representations. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) were proposed to satisfy this demand, but suffer from a significant runtime performance bottleneck due to the large Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) tables that must be built for rANS coding. This paper introduces a fast coding algorithm that entirely eliminates this bottleneck. By leveraging the CDF's monotonic property, our decoder performs a dynamic binary search to find the correct symbol, eliminating the need for costly table construction and lookup. Aided by SIMD optimizations and numerical approximations, our approach accelerates the GMM entropy coding process by up to approximately 90x without compromising rate-distortion performance, significantly improving the practicality of GMM-based codecs. The implementation will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Towards Evaluating Generative Audio: Insights from Neural Audio Codec Embedding Distances
Authors: Arijit Biswas, Lars Villemoes
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) achieve low-bitrate compression by learning compact audio representations, which can also serve as features for perceptual quality evaluation. We introduce DACe, an enhanced, higher-fidelity version of the Descript Audio Codec (DAC), trained on diverse real and synthetic tonal data with balanced sampling. We systematically compare Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) on MUSHRA tests across speech, music, and mixed content. FAD consistently outperforms MMD, and embeddings from higher-fidelity NACs (such as DACe) show stronger correlations with human judgments. While CLAP LAION Music (CLAP-M) and OpenL3 Mel128 (OpenL3-128M) embeddings achieve higher correlations, NAC embeddings provide a practical zero-shot approach to audio quality assessment, requiring only unencoded audio for training. These results demonstrate the dual utility of NACs for compression and perceptually informed audio evaluation.

Title: Normal mode parameters estimation by a VLA in single-shooting
Authors: Xiaolei Li, Pengyu Wang, Wenhua Song, Yangjin Xu, Wei Gao
Abstract: This paper proposes an orthogonality-constrained modal search (OCMS) method for estimating modal wavenumbers and modal depth functions using a vertical linear array (VLA). Under the assumption of a known sound speed profile, OCMS leverages the orthogonality of distinct modal depth functions to extract both the modal depth functions and their corresponding wavenumbers, even when the VLA and a monochromatic sound source remain this http URL performance of OCMS is evaluated through numerical simulations under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different VLA apertures, varying numbers of VLA elements, VLA tilt and sound speed profile (SSP) uncertainty. The results demonstrate that OCMS is robust against noise, VLA aperture variations, and changes in the number of VLA elements, meanwhile, the algorithm maintains reliable performance when SSP uncertainty < 1 m/s and VLA tilt angle <5°. Furthermore, the effectiveness of OCMS is validated using SwellEx96 experimental data. The relative error between the modal wavenumbers derived from experimental data and those computed via Kraken is on the order of $10^{-4}$.

Title: Influence of Clean Speech Characteristics on Speech Enhancement Performance
Authors: Mingchi Hou, Ina Kodrasi
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) performance is known to depend on noise characteristics and signal to noise ratio (SNR), yet intrinsic properties of the clean speech signal itself remain an underexplored factor. In this work, we systematically analyze how clean speech characteristics influence enhancement difficulty across multiple state of the art SE models, languages, and noise conditions. We extract a set of pitch, formant, loudness, and spectral flux features from clean speech and compute correlations with objective SE metrics, including frequency weighted segmental SNR and PESQ. Our results show that formant amplitudes are consistently predictive of SE performance, with higher and more stable formants leading to larger enhancement gains. We further demonstrate that performance varies substantially even within a single speaker's utterances, highlighting the importance of intraspeaker acoustic variability. These findings provide new insights into SE challenges, suggesting that intrinsic speech characteristics should be considered when designing datasets, evaluation protocols, and enhancement models.

Title: Generalizability of Predictive and Generative Speech Enhancement Models to Pathological Speakers
Authors: Mingchi Hou, Ante Jukic, Ina Kodrasi
Abstract: State of the art speech enhancement (SE) models achieve strong performance on neurotypical speech, but their effectiveness is substantially reduced for pathological speech. In this paper, we investigate strategies to address this gap for both predictive and generative SE models, including i) training models from scratch using pathological data, ii) finetuning models pretrained on neurotypical speech with additional data from pathological speakers, and iii) speaker specific personalization using only data from the individual pathological test speaker. Our results show that, despite the limited size of pathological speech datasets, SE models can be successfully trained or finetuned on such data. Finetuning models with data from several pathological speakers yields the largest performance improvements, while speaker specific personalization is less effective, likely due to the small amount of data available per speaker. These findings highlight the challenges and potential strategies for improving SE performance for pathological speakers.

Title: Quaternion LMS for Graph Signal Recovery
Authors: Hamideh-Sadat Fazael-Ardekani, Hadi Zayyani, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh
Abstract: This letter generalizes the Graph Signal Recovery (GSR) problem in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) to the Quaternion domain. It extends the Quaternion Least Mean Square (QLMS) in adaptive filtering literature, and Graph LMS (GLMS) algorithm in GSP literature, to an algorithm called Quaternion GLMS (QGLMS). The basic adaptation formula using Quaternion-based algebra is derived. Moreover, mean convergence analysis and mean-square convergence analysis are mathematically performed. Hence, a sufficient condition on the step-size parameter of QGLMS is suggested. Also, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in graph signal reconstruction.

Title: Direct Preference Optimization for Speech Autoregressive Diffusion Models
Authors: Zhijun Liu, Dongya Jia, Xiaoqiang Wang, Chenpeng Du, Shuai Wang, Zhuo Chen, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Autoregressive diffusion models (ARDMs) have recently been applied to speech generation, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in zero-shot text-to-speech. By autoregressively generating continuous speech tokens with next-token diffusion, these models offer a promising alternative to next-token prediction, avoiding the technical complexities associated with discrete speech tokenization. As a relatively new paradigm, research on reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of speech ARDMs remains limited. In this paper, we propose Autoregressive Diffusion-Direct Preference Optimization (ARDM-DPO) to advance this research. By fine-tuning the recently proposed zero-shot text-to-speech model DiTAR with DPO, we achieve significant improvements in terms of speech expressiveness and robustness for long texts.

Title: Frequency-Varying Optimization: A Control Framework for New Dynamic Frequency Response Services
Authors: Yiqiao Xu, Quan Wan, Alessandra Parisio
Abstract: To address the variability of renewable generation, initiatives have been launched globally to provide faster and more effective frequency responses. In the UK, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has introduced a suite of three new dynamic services, where aggregation of assets is expected to play a key role. For an Aggregated Response Unit (ARU), the required level of frequency response varies with grid frequency, resulting in a frequency-varying equality constraint that assets should meet collectively. We show that the optimal coordination of an ARU constitutes a Frequency-Varying Optimization (FVO) problem, in which the optimal trajectory for each asset evolves dynamically. To facilitate online optimization, we reformulate the FVO problem into Tracking of the Optimal Trajectory (TOT) problems, with algorithms proposed for two scenarios: one where the asset dynamics are negligible, and another where they must be accounted for. Under reasonable conditions, the ARU converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time, and within the maximum delivery time requested by NESO. The proposed framework can be readily distributed to coordinate a large number of assets. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed control framework.

Title: Adaptive Override Control under High-Relative-Degree Nonovershooting Constraints
Authors: Ziliang Lyu, Miroslav Krstic, Kaixin Lu, Yiguang Hong, Lihua Xie
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adaptively overriding unsafe actions of a nominal controller in the presence of high-relative-degree nonovershooting constraints and parametric uncertainties. To prevent the design from being coupled with high-order derivatives of the parameter estimation error, we adopt a modular design approach in which the controller and the parameter identifier are designed separately. The controller module ensures that any safety violations caused by parametric uncertainties remain bounded, provided that the parameter estimation error and its first-order derivative are either bounded or square-integrable. The identifier module, in turn, guarantees that these requirements on the parameter estimation error are satisfied. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the closed-loop safety violation is bounded by a tunable function of the initial estimation error. Moreover, as time increases, the parameter estimate converges to the true value, and the amount of safety violation decreases accordingly.

Title: HD-PPT: Hierarchical Decoding of Content- and Prompt-Preference Tokens for Instruction-based TTS
Authors: Sihang Nie, Xiaofen Xing, Jingyuan Xing, Baiji Liu, Xiangmin Xu
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have already reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

Title: Enhancing Noise Robustness for Neural Speech Codecs through Resource-Efficient Progressive Quantization Perturbation Simulation
Authors: Rui-Chen Zheng, Yang Ai, Hui-Peng Du, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Noise robustness remains a critical challenge for deploying neural speech codecs in real-world acoustic scenarios where background noise is often inevitable. A key observation we make is that even slight input noise perturbations can cause unintended shifts in quantized codewords, thereby degrading the quality of reconstructed speech. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel and resource-efficient training strategy to enhance the noise robustness of speech codecs by simulating such perturbations directly at the quantization level. Our approach introduces two core mechanisms: (1) a distance-weighted probabilistic top-K sampling strategy that replaces the conventional deterministic nearest-neighbor selection in residual vector quantization (RVQ); and (2) a progressive training scheme that introduces perturbations from the last to the first quantizer in a controlled manner. Crucially, our method is trained exclusively on clean speech, eliminating the need for any paired noisy-clean data. Experiments on two advanced neural speech codecs, Encodec and WavTokenizer, demonstrate that the proposed strategy substantially improves robustness under noisy conditions-for example, boosting UTMOS from 3.475 to 3.586 at 15 dB SNR on Encodec-while also enhancing coding quality for clean speech.

Title: A Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimator of the American Multi-modal Energy System
Authors: Dakota Thompson, Amro M. Farid
Abstract: As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate change demands a host of changes across at least four critical energy infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system. In the context of the United States, this paper refers to this system-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)". These combined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies, both structurally and behaviorally, to develop and enact effective policies. This work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to analyze system behavior and the critical matter and energy flows through the system. Building upon past works, two regions of the AMES are modeled, and their behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT). More specifically, the work presents a weighted least square error state estimation model of the AMES. State estimation has played a major role in the operation and development of the American Electric Power System. This work extends the state estimation analysis beyond the single-operand electric grid environment into the heterogeneous environment of the AMES. Employing a data-driven and model-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT, a Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation (WLSEHFGSE) optimization program is developed to estimate the optimal flows of mass and energy through the AMES. This work is the first to integrate state estimation methods with HFGT. Furthermore, it demonstrates how such a WLSEHFGSE recovers the mass and energy flows in a system-of-systems like the AMES with asset-level granularity.

Title: Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks for Prior Learning in Graph Signal Recovery
Authors: Razieh Torkamani, Arash Amini, Hadi Zayyani, Mehdi Korki
Abstract: Graph signal recovery (GSR) is a fundamental problem in graph signal processing, where the goal is to reconstruct a complete signal defined over a graph from a subset of noisy or missing observations. A central challenge in GSR is that the underlying statistical model of the graph signal is often unknown or too complex to specify analytically. To address this, we propose a flexible, data-driven framework that learns the signal prior directly from training samples. We develop a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) architecture that models the prior distribution of graph signals using graph-aware filters based on Chebyshev polynomials. By interpreting the hidden layers of the CNN as Gibbs distributions and employing Gaussian mixture model (GMM) nonlinearities, we obtain a closed-form and expressive prior. This prior is integrated into a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework to estimate the posterior distribution of the signal and noise precision. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCNN-GSR algorithm achieves accurate and robust recovery across a variety of signal distributions. The method generalizes well to complex, non-Gaussian signal models and remains computationally efficient, making it suitable for practical large-scale graph recovery tasks.

Title: MAPPO for Edge Server Monitoring
Authors: Samuel Chamoun, Christian McDowell, Robin Buchanan, Kevin Chan, Eric Graves, Yin Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where jobs arrive intermittently at multiple dispatchers and must be assigned to shared edge servers with finite queues and time-varying availability. Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution feedback that reveals server conditions opportunistically. We formulate a cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Numerical evaluations show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving on average a 30% improvement over the closest baseline.

Title: Training Flow Matching Models with Reliable Labels via Self-Purification
Authors: Hyeongju Kim, Yechan Yu, June Young Yi, Juheon Lee
Abstract: Training datasets are inherently imperfect, often containing mislabeled samples due to human annotation errors, limitations of tagging models, and other sources of noise. Such label contamination can significantly degrade the performance of a trained model. In this work, we introduce Self-Purifying Flow Matching (SPFM), a principled approach to filtering unreliable data within the flow-matching framework. SPFM identifies suspicious data using the model itself during the training process, bypassing the need for pretrained models or additional modules. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with SPFM generate samples that accurately adhere to the specified conditioning, even when trained on noisy labels. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of SPFM on the TITW dataset, which consists of in-the-wild speech data, achieving performance that surpasses existing baselines.

Title: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for LiDAR-Aided Beam Tracking in MmWave Systems
Authors: Abolfazl Zakeri, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Ahmed Alkhateeb, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Multimodal sensing reduces beam training overhead but is constrained by machine learning complexity and dataset demands. To address this, we propose a data-free (DF) knowledge distillation (KD) framework for efficient LiDAR-aided mmWave beam tracking, i.e., predicting the best current and future beams. Specifically, we propose a knowledge inversion framework, where a generator synthesizes LiDAR input data from random noise, guided by a loss function defined on the features and outputs of a pre-trained teacher model. The student model is then trained using the synthetic data and knowledge distilled from the teacher. The generator loss combines three terms, called metadata loss, activation loss, and entropy loss. For student training, in addition to the standard Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, we also consider a mean-squared error (MSE) loss between the teacher and student logits. Simulation results show that the proposed DF-KD (slightly) outperforms the teacher in Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies. Moreover, we observe that the metadata loss contributes significantly to the generator performance, and that the MSE loss for the student can effectively replace the standard KD loss while requiring fewer fine-tuned hyperparameters.

Title: On-device Internet of Sounds Sonification with Wavetable Synthesis Techniques for Soil Moisture Monitoring in Water Scarcity Contexts
Authors: Stephen Roddy
Abstract: Sonification, the mapping of data to sound to communicate information about the original data source, is becoming a viable strategy for the sonic representation and communication of information derived from the complex flows of data exchanged across Internet of Sounds (IoS) networks. This paper presents an IoS sonification implementation for monitoring soil moisture levels within the broader context of the globally increasing water scarcity. While previous work has focused on sonifications operating on the applications and services level of the IoS network infrastructure, this paper explores device-level sonification using wavetable synthesis techniques to map sensor data to acoustic parameters. An approach to on-device wavetable sonification is formalized, and a prototype implementation is presented and explored before the approach is contextualised with regard to the soil moisture monitoring tasks.

Title: AI-Enabled Smart Hygiene System for Real-Time Glucose Detection
Authors: Khan Masood Parvez, Sk Md Abidar Rahaman, Ali Shiri Sichani, Hadi AliAkbarpour
Abstract: This research presents a smart urinary health monitoring system incorporating a coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed slot-loop antenna biosensor designed to analyse various urine samples. The antenna demonstrates distinct resonant frequency shifts when exposed to five specific urine conditions, deviating from its baseline 1.42 GHz operation. These measurable frequency variations enable the antenna to function as an effective microwave sensor for urinary biomarker detection. A potential artificial intelligence-based Convolutional Neural Networks Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) framework is also discussed to overcome the limitations of overlapping frequency responses, aiming to improve the accuracy of health condition detection. These components contribute to the development of a smart toilet system that displays real-time health information on a wall-mounted urinal screen, without requiring any user effort or behavioural change.

Title: A Fast Initialization Method for Neural Network Controllers: A Case Study of Image-based Visual Servoing Control for the multicopter Interception
Authors: Chenxu Ke, Congling Tian, Kaichen Xu, Ye Li, Lingcong Bao
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based controller design methods often require substantial data in the initial training phase. Moreover, the training process tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final interception velocity of 15 m/s.

Title: Robust Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Looked Loop (PLL) with Feed-Forward Frequency Estimation
Authors: Michael Ruderman, Elia Brescia, Paolo Roberto Massenio, Giuseppe Leonardo Cascella, David Naso
Abstract: Synchronous reference frame phase-looked loop (SRF-PLL) techniques are widely used for interfacing and control applications in the power systems and energy conversion at large. Since a PLL system synchronizes its output with an exogenous harmonic signal, often 3-phases voltage or current, the locking of the frequency and phase angle depends on the performance of the feedback loop with at least two integrator terms, and on the distortions of the measured input quantities. For the conventional SRF-PLL with a proportional-integral (PI) control in feedback, we are providing a robust design which maximizes the phase margin and uses the normalization scheme for yielding the loop insensitive to the input amplitude variations. The main improvement in the transient behavior and also in tracking of frequency ramps is achieved by using the robust feed-forward frequency estimator, which is model-free and suitable for the noisy and time-varying harmonic signals. The proposed feed-forward-feedback SRF-PLL scheme is experimentally evaluated on the 3-phases harmonic currents from standard PMSM drives with varying angular speeds and loads. Both, the tracked angular frequency and locked phase angle are assessed as performance metrics of the robust SRF-PLL scheme with feedforwarding.

Title: Enabling Drone Detection with SWARM Repeater-Assisted MIMO ISAC
Authors: Palatip Jopanya, Diana P. M. Osorio
Abstract: As definitions about new architectural aspects, use cases, and standards for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) continue to appear, cellular systems based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology are also experiencing a parallel evolution through the integration of novel network components. This evolution should support emerging ISAC use cases and services. In particular, this paper explores a recent vision for cost-efficient cellular network densification through the deployment of swarms of repeaters. Leveraging their ability to retransmit signals instantaneously, we investigate how these repeaters can enhance radar sensing capabilities for drone detection in a swarm repeater-assisted MIMO ISAC system. Our results demonstrate that, by optimizing the gains of repeaters given a sufficient maximum amplification gain, increasing the number of repeaters can lead to gains in sensing performance.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Sensing and Communications
Authors: Abolfazl Zakeri, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Ahmed Alkhateeb, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Environmental sensing can significantly enhance mmWave communications by assisting beam training, yet its benefits must be balanced against the associated sensing costs. To this end, we propose a unified machine learning framework that dynamically determines when to sense and leverages sensory data for beam prediction. Specifically, we formulate a joint sensing and beamforming problem that maximizes the av- erage signal-to-noise ratio under an average sensing budget. Lyapunov optimization is employed to enforce the sensing constraint, while a deep Q-Network determines the sensing slots. A pretrained deep neural network then maps the sens- ing data to optimal beams in the codebook. Simulations based on the real-world DeepSense dataset demonstrate that the pro- posed approach substantially reduces sensing overhead while maintaining satisfactory communications performance.

Title: Improving Test-Time Performance of RVQ-based Neural Codecs
Authors: Hyeongju Kim, Junhyeok Lee, Jacob Morton, Juheon Lee, Jinhyeok Yang
Abstract: The residual vector quantization (RVQ) technique plays a central role in recent advances in neural audio codecs. These models effectively synthesize high-fidelity audio from a limited number of codes due to the hierarchical structure among quantization levels. In this paper, we propose an encoding algorithm to further enhance the synthesis quality of RVQ-based neural codecs at test-time. Firstly, we point out the suboptimal nature of quantized vectors generated by conventional methods. We demonstrate that quantization error can be mitigated by selecting a different set of codes. Subsequently, we present our encoding algorithm, designed to identify a set of discrete codes that achieve a lower quantization error. We then apply the proposed method to pre-trained models and evaluate its efficacy using diverse metrics. Our experimental findings validate that our method not only reduces quantization errors, but also improves synthesis quality.

Title: An on-chip Pixel Processing Approach with 2.4μs latency for Asynchronous Read-out of SPAD-based dToF Flash LiDARs
Authors: Yiyang Liu, Rongxuan Zhang, Istvan Gyongy, Alistair Gorman, Sarrah M. Patanwala, Filip Taneski, Robert K. Henderson
Abstract: We propose a fully asynchronous peak detection approach for SPAD-based direct time-of-flight (dToF) flash LiDAR, enabling pixel-wise event-driven depth acquisition without global synchronization. By allowing pixels to independently report depth once a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio is achieved, the method reduces latency, mitigates motion blur, and increases effective frame rate compared to frame-based systems. The framework is validated under two hardware implementations: an offline 256$\times$128 SPAD array with PC based processing and a real-time FPGA proof-of-concept prototype with 2.4$\upmu$s latency for on-chip integration. Experiments demonstrate robust depth estimation, reflectivity reconstruction, and dynamic event-based representation under both static and dynamic conditions. The results confirm that asynchronous operation reduces redundant background data and computational load, while remaining tunable via simple hyperparameters. These findings establish a foundation for compact, low-latency, event-driven LiDAR architectures suited to robotics, autonomous driving, and consumer applications. In addition, we have derived a semi-closed-form solution for the detection probability of the raw-peak finding based LiDAR systems that could benefit both conventional frame-based and proposed asynchronous LiDAR systems.

Title: MUSHRA-1S: A scalable and sensitive test approach for evaluating top-tier speech processing systems
Authors: Laura Lechler, Ivana Balic
Abstract: Evaluating state-of-the-art speech systems necessitates scalable and sensitive evaluation methods to detect subtle but unacceptable artifacts. Standard MUSHRA is sensitive but lacks scalability, while ACR scales well but loses sensitivity and saturates at a high quality. To address this, we introduce MUSHRA 1S, a single-stimulus variant that rates one system at a time against a fixed anchor and reference. Across our experiments, MUSHRA 1S matches standard MUSHRA more closely than ACR, including in the high-quality regime, where ACR saturates. MUSHRA 1S also effectively identifies specific deviations and reduces range-equalizing biases by fixing context. Overall, MUSHRA 1S combines MUSHRA level sensitivity with ACR like scalability, making it a robust and scalable solution for benchmarking top-tier speech processing systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of terahertz~(THz) wireless systems over the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{F}$ fading channels with beam misalignment and mobility. New expressions are derived for the probability density, cumulative distribution, and moment generating functions, as well as higher-order moments of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. Building upon the aforementioned expressions, we extract novel formulas for the outage probability, symbol error probability, and average channel capacity. Asymptotic metrics are also deduced, which provide useful insights. Monte Carlo simulations results are presented to support the derived analytical framework.

Title: Watts and Drops: Co-Scheduling Power and Water in Desalination Plants
Authors: Ahmed S. Alahmed, Audun Botterud, Saurabh Amin, Ali T. Al-Awami
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework to jointly schedule water and electricity in a profit-maximizing renewable colocated water desalination plant that integrates both thermal and membrane based technologies. The price-taking desalination plant sells desalinated water to a water utility at a given price and engages in bidirectional electricity transactions with the grid, purchasing or selling power based on its net electricity demand. We show that the optimal scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.

Title: Policy Gradient Bounds in Multitask LQR
Authors: Charis Stamouli, Leonardo F. Toso, Anastasios Tsiamis, George J. Pappas, James Anderson
Abstract: We analyze the performance of policy gradient in multitask linear quadratic regulation (LQR), where the system and cost parameters differ across tasks. The main goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory performance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture closed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance guarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based measures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions to bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with a common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive suboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the asymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We further provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain stabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we observe that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of task heterogeneity dramatically.

Title: Faster-Than-Nyquist Signalling - Theoretical Limits on Capacity and Techniques to Approach Capacity
Authors: Sathwik Chadaga
Abstract: Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) Signalling is a non-orthogonal transmission scheme that violates the Nyquist zero-ISI criterion providing higher throughput and better spectral efficiency than a Nyquist transmission scheme. In this thesis, the inter symbol interference (ISI) introduced by FTN signalling is studied, and conditions on pulse shapes and $\tau$ (time acceleration factor) are derived so that the ISI can be avoided completely. Further, these conditions are reinforced by investigating the theoretical limits on the capacities of FTN systems. Finally, the use of power allocation and adaptive loading techniques are explored in reducing the effect of ISI and increasing the throughput of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) FTN systems. The implementation of these techniques and simulation results are also demonstrated.

Title: A Novel Site-Specific Inference Model for Urban Canyon Channels: From Measurements to Modeling
Authors: Junzhe Song, Ruisi He, Mi Yang, Zhengyu Zhang, Xinwen Chen, Xiaoying Zhang, Bo Ai
Abstract: With the rapid development of intelligent transportation and smart city applications, urban canyon has become a critical scenario for the design and evaluation of wireless communication systems. Due to its unique environmental layout, the channel characteristics in urban canyon are strongly a street geometry and building distribution, thereby exhibiting significant site-specific channel condition. However, this feature has not been well captured in existing channel models. In this paper, we propose a site-specific channel inference model based on environmental geometry, the model is parameterized using sub-6GHz channel measurements. Multipath components (MPCs) are extracted and clustered according to geometric propagation, which are explicitly derived from the influence of canyon width, thereby establishing an interpretable mapping between the physical environment and statistical characteristics of MPCs. A step-by-step implementation scheme is presented. Subsequently, the proposed site-specific channel inference model is validated by comparing second-order statistics of channels, derived from the model and measurements. The results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness in different urban canyon scenarios.

Title: MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion interactive segmentation of neurobromas in whole-body MRI
Authors: Georgii Kolokolnikov, Marie-Lena Schmalhofer, Sophie Götz, Lennart Well, Said Farschtschi, Victor-Felix Mautner, Inka Ristow, Rene Werner
Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge. Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor). Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69). Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.

Title: STFT-AECNN: An Attention-Enhanced CNN for Efficient Φ-OTDR Event Recognition in IoT-Enabled Distributed Acoustic Sensing
Authors: Xiyang Lan, Xin Li
Abstract: Phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry ({\Phi}-OTDR) has emerged as a promising sensing technology in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, enabling large-scale distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) for smart city surveillance, industrial pipeline monitoring, and critical infrastructure protection. However, accurately recognizing events from massive {\Phi}-OTDR data streams remains challenging, as existing deep learning methods either disrupt the inherent spatiotemporal structure of signals or incur prohibitive computational costs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained IoT scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel STFT-based Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (STFT-AECNN), which represents multi-channel time-series data as stacked spectrograms to fully exploit their spatiotemporal characteristics while enabling efficient 2D CNN processing. A Spatial Efficient Attention Module (SEAM) is further introduced to adaptively emphasize the most informative channels, and a joint Cross-Entropy and Triplet loss is adopted to enhance the discriminability of the learned feature space. Extensive experiments on the public BJTU {\Phi}-OTDR dataset demonstrate that STFT-AECNN achieves a peak accuracy of 99.94% while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight its potential for real-time, scalable, and robust event recognition in IoT-enabled DAS systems, paving the way for reliable and intelligent IoT sensing applications.

Authors: Yonghyun Kim, Chaeyeon Han, Akash Sarode, Noah Posner, Subhrajit Guhathakurta, Alexander Lerch
Abstract: Audio-based pedestrian detection is a challenging task and has, thus far, only been explored in noise-limited environments. We present a new dataset, results, and a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art in audio-based pedestrian detection in the presence of vehicular noise. In our study, we conduct three analyses: (i) cross-dataset evaluation between noisy and noise-limited environments, (ii) an assessment of the impact of noisy data on model performance, highlighting the influence of acoustic context, and (iii) an evaluation of the model's predictive robustness on out-of-domain sounds. The new dataset is a comprehensive 1321-hour roadside dataset. It incorporates traffic-rich soundscapes. Each recording includes 16kHz audio synchronized with frame-level pedestrian annotations and 1fps video thumbnails.

Title: XMUspeech Systems for the ASVspoof 5 Challenge
Authors: Wangjie Li, Xingjia Xie, Yishuang Li, Wenhao Guan, Kaidi Wang, Pengyu Ren, Lin Li, Qingyang Hong
Abstract: In this paper, we present our submitted XMUspeech systems to the speech deepfake detection track of the ASVspoof 5 Challenge. Compared to previous challenges, the audio duration in ASVspoof 5 database has significantly increased. And we observed that merely adjusting the input audio length can substantially improve system performance. To capture artifacts at multiple levels, we explored the performance of AASIST, HM-Conformer, Hubert, and Wav2vec2 with various input features and loss functions. Specifically, in order to obtain artifact-related information, we trained self-supervised models on the dataset containing spoofing utterances as the feature extractors. And we applied an adaptive multi-scale feature fusion (AMFF) method to integrate features from multiple Transformer layers with the hand-crafted feature to enhance the detection capability. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on one-class loss functions and provided optimized configurations to better align with the anti-spoofing task. Our fusion system achieved a minDCF of 0.4783 and an EER of 20.45% in the closed condition, and a minDCF of 0.2245 and an EER of 9.36% in the open condition.

Title: Weight Mapping Properties of a Dual Tree Single Clock Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron
Authors: Mike Smart, Sachin Maheshwari, Himadri Singh Raghav, Alexander Serb
Abstract: Dual Tree Single Clock (DTSC) Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron (ACN) circuits offer the potential for highly energy-efficient Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computation in full custom analog IC designs. The efficient mapping of Artificial Neuron (AN) abstract weights, extracted from the software-trained ANNs, onto physical ACN capacitance values has, however, yet to be fully researched. In this paper, we explore the unexpected hidden complexities, challenges and properties of the mapping, as well as, the ramifications for IC designers in terms accuracy, design and implementation. We propose an optimal, AN to ACN methodology, that promotes smaller chip sizes and improved overall classification accuracy, necessary for successful practical deployment. Using TensorFlow and Larq software frameworks, we train three different ANN networks and map their weights into the energy-efficient DTSC ACN capacitance value domain to demonstrate 100% functional equivalency. Finally, we delve into the impact of weight quantization on ACN performance using novel metrics related to practical IC considerations, such as IC floor space and comparator decision-making efficacy.

Title: Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode
Authors: Shakir Showkat Sofi, Lieven De Lathauwer
Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: AI-Derived Structural Building Intelligence for Urban Resilience: An Application in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
Authors: Isabelle Tingzon, Yoji Toriumi, Caroline Gevaert
Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS) in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance. Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building, our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban governance.

Title: MNV-17: A High-Quality Performative Mandarin Dataset for Nonverbal Vocalization Recognition in Speech
Authors: Jialong Mai, Jinxin Ji, Xiaofen Xing, Chen Yang, Weidong Chen, Jingyuan Xing, Xiangmin Xu
Abstract: Mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems excel at transcribing lexical content, but largely fail to recognize nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) embedded in speech, such as sighs, laughs, and coughs. This capability is important for a comprehensive understanding of human communication, as NVs convey crucial emotional and intentional cues. Progress in NV-aware ASR has been hindered by the lack of high-quality, well-annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MNV-17, a 7.55-hour performative Mandarin speech dataset. Unlike most existing corpora that rely on model-based detection, MNV-17's performative nature ensures high-fidelity, clearly articulated NV instances. To the best of our knowledge, MNV-17 provides the most extensive set of nonverbal vocalization categories, comprising 17 distinct and well-balanced classes of common NVs. We benchmarked MNV-17 on four mainstream ASR architectures, evaluating their joint performance on semantic transcription and NV classification. The dataset and the pretrained model checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in expressive ASR.

Title: StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video
Authors: Tornike Karchkhadze, Kuan-Lin Chen, Mojtaba (Moji)Heydari, Robert Henzel, Alessandro Toso, Mehrez Souden, Joshua Atkins
Abstract: We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.

Title: Qubit Instrumentation of Entanglement
Authors: Mark Carney
Abstract: This chapter and the experiments described within explore how `human entanglement' might be represented and even emulated by physical entanglement. To achieve this, a notion of `tonal centrality' between two musicians is captured via MIDI and passed as a parameter into a quantum simulation taking place on an embedded device (a Raspberry Pi Pico). The results of these simulations are then coded back into MIDI and sent to the players' instruments. The closer the musicians' tonality is, the more their instruments will be entangled in a $|\Phi^+ \rangle$ state, and the further away they are the more their instruments will be entangled in a $|\Psi^+ \rangle$ state. The intention is to create random parameters that are correlative - \emph{i.e.} the same on both instruments - or anti-correlative - \emph{i.e.} the bit-wise opposite of each other, influenced by the tonal relationship from the players. These random parameters sharing these particular properties add a new dimension for quantum-musical expression. This concept was realised experimentally, and the full code and sample outputs are provided. This work aims to pave the way for musicians to explore and experience quantum emulations of their own musical experiences, adding a new nuance and possibilities for the future of \emph{entangled ensembles.}

Title: A Single Image Is All You Need: Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Without Training Data
Authors: Mehrdad Moradi, Shengzhe Chen, Hao Yan, Kamran Paynabar
Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at this https URL

Title: A Dimensional Approach to Canine Bark Analysis for Assistance Dog Seizure Signaling
Authors: Hailin Song, Shelley Brady, Tomás Ward, Alan F. Smeaton
Abstract: Standard classification of canine vocalisations is severely limited for assistance dogs, where sample data is sparse and variable across dogs and where capture of the full range of bark types is ethically constrained. We reframe this problem as a continuous regression task within a two-dimensional arousal-valence space. Central to our approach is an adjusted Siamese Network trained not on binary similarity, but on the ordinal and numeric distance between input sample pairs. Trained on a public dataset, our model reduces Turn-around Percentage by up to 50% on the challenging valence dimension compared to a regression baseline. Qualitative validation on a real-world dataset confirms the learned space is semantically meaningful, establishing a proof-of-concept for analysing canine barking under severe data limitations.

Title: Identifying birdsong syllables without labelled data
Authors: Mélisande Teng, Julien Boussard, David Rolnick, Hugo Larochelle
Abstract: Identifying sequences of syllables within birdsongs is key to tackling a wide array of challenges, including bird individual identification and better understanding of animal communication and sensory-motor learning. Recently, machine learning approaches have demonstrated great potential to alleviate the need for experts to label long audio recordings by hand. However, they still typically rely on the availability of labelled data for model training, restricting applicability to a few species and datasets. In this work, we build the first fully unsupervised algorithm to decompose birdsong recordings into sequences of syllables. We first detect syllable events, then cluster them to extract templates --syllable representations-- before performing matching pursuit to decompose the recording as a sequence of syllables. We evaluate our automatic annotations against human labels on a dataset of Bengalese finch songs and find that our unsupervised method achieves high performance. We also demonstrate that our approach can distinguish individual birds within a species through their unique vocal signatures, for both Bengalese finches and another species, the great tit.

Title: Scattering Transformer: A Training-Free Transformer Architecture for Heart Murmur Detection
Authors: Rami Zewail
Abstract: In an attempt to address the need for skilled clinicians in heart sound interpretation, recent research efforts on automating cardiac auscultation have explored deep learning approaches. The majority of these approaches have been based on supervised learning that is always challenged in occasions where training data is limited. More recently, there has been a growing interest in potentials of pre-trained self-supervised audio foundation models for biomedical end tasks. Despite exhibiting promising results, these foundational models are typically computationally intensive. Within the context of automatic cardiac auscultation, this study explores a lightweight alternative to these general-purpose audio foundation models by introducing the Scattering Transformer, a novel, training-free transformer architecture for heart murmur detection. The proposed method leverages standard wavelet scattering networks by introducing contextual dependencies in a transformer-like architecture without any backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on the public CirCor DigiScope dataset, directly comparing it against leading general-purpose foundational models. The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted Accuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697, demonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art methods. This study establishes the Scattering Transformer as a viable and promising alternative in resource-constrained setups.

Title: A Counterfactual Reasoning Framework for Fault Diagnosis in Robot Perception Systems
Authors: Haeyoon Han, Mahdi Taheri, Soon-Jo Chung, Fred Y. Hadaegh
Abstract: Perception systems provide a rich understanding of the environment for autonomous systems, shaping decisions in all downstream modules. Hence, accurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important. Faults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied to the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage pipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a counterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection and isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical redundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical redundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability tests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios. Counterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized faults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and active FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates, the active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find control inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as Effective Information (EI). The mentioned metric quantifies the informativeness of control inputs for FDI. We demonstrate the approach in a robot exploration scenario, where a space robot performing vision-based navigation actively adjusts its attitude to increase EI and correctly isolate faults caused by sensor damage, dynamic scenes, and perceptual degradation.

Title: Discrete-time diffusion-like models for speech synthesis
Authors: Xiaozhou Tan, Minghui Zhao, Mattias Cross, Anton Ragni
Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

Title: Trace Is In Sentences: Unbiased Lightweight ChatGPT-Generated Text Detector
Authors: Mo Mu, Dianqiao Lei, Chang Li
Abstract: The widespread adoption of ChatGPT has raised concerns about its misuse, highlighting the need for robust detection of AI-generated text. Current word-level detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing or simple prompts (PSP), suffer from biases induced by ChatGPT's word-level patterns (CWP) and training data content, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or online LLM interaction. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel task to detect both original and PSP-modified AI-generated texts, and propose a lightweight framework that classifies texts based on their internal structure, which remains invariant under word-level changes. Our approach encodes sentence embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via attention. We employ contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases from autoregressive generation and incorporate a causal graph with counterfactual methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases. Experiments on two curated datasets, including abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs, validate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Event-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Human and Scene Reconstruction
Authors: Xiaoting Yin, Hao Shi, Kailun Yang, Jiajun Zhai, Shangwei Guo, Lin Wang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Title: Explore the Reinforcement Learning for the LLM based ASR and TTS system
Authors: Changfeng Gao, Yabin Li, Keyu An, Zhifu Gao, Zhihao Du, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have played an important role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.

Title: VLN-Zero: Rapid Exploration and Cache-Enabled Neurosymbolic Vision-Language Planning for Zero-Shot Transfer in Robot Navigation
Authors: Neel P. Bhatt, Yunhao Yang, Rohan Siva, Pranay Samineni, Daniel Milan, Zhangyang Wang, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments. Codebase, datasets, and videos for VLN-Zero are available at: this https URL.

Title: Scalable Evaluation for Audio Identification via Synthetic Latent Fingerprint Generation
Authors: Aditya Bhattacharjee, Marco Pasini, Emmanouil Benetos
Abstract: The evaluation of audio fingerprinting at a realistic scale is limited by the scarcity of large public music databases. We present an audio-free approach that synthesises latent fingerprints which approximate the distribution of real fingerprints. Our method trains a Rectified Flow model on embeddings extracted by pre-trained neural audio fingerprinting systems. The synthetic fingerprints generated using our system act as realistic distractors and enable the simulation of retrieval performance at a large scale without requiring additional audio. We assess the fidelity of synthetic fingerprints by comparing the distributions to real data. We further benchmark the retrieval performances across multiple state-of-the-art audio fingerprinting frameworks by augmenting real reference databases with synthetic distractors, and show that the scaling trends obtained with synthetic distractors closely track those obtained with real distractors. Finally, we scale the synthetic distractor database to model retrieval performance for very large databases, providing a practical metric of system scalability that does not depend on access to audio corpora.

Title: Subspace Clustering of Subspaces: Unifying Canonical Correlation Analysis and Subspace Clustering
Authors: Paris A. Karakasis, Nicholas D. Sidiropoulos
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.

Title: Distributionally Robust Safe Motion Planning with Contextual Information
Authors: Kaizer Rahaman, Simran Kumari, Ashish R. Hota
Abstract: We present a distributionally robust approach for collision avoidance by incorporating contextual information. Specifically, we embed the conditional distribution of future trajectory of the obstacle conditioned on the motion of the ego agent in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via the conditional kernel mean embedding operator. Then, we define an ambiguity set containing all distributions whose embedding in the RKHS is within a certain distance from the empirical estimate of conditional mean embedding learnt from past data. Consequently, a distributionally robust collision avoidance constraint is formulated, and included in the receding horizon based motion planning formulation of the ego agent. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more successful in avoiding collision compared to approaches that do not include contextual information and/or distributional robustness in their formulation in several challenging scenarios.

Title: 3D Flow Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Generating Flow in 3D Space
Authors: Sangjun Noh, Dongwoo Nam, Kangmin Kim, Geonhyup Lee, Yeonguk Yu, Raeyoung Kang, Kyoobin Lee
Abstract: Learning robust visuomotor policies that generalize across diverse objects and interaction dynamics remains a central challenge in robotic manipulation. Most existing approaches rely on direct observation-to-action mappings or compress perceptual inputs into global or object-centric features, which often overlook localized motion cues critical for precise and contact-rich manipulation. We present 3D Flow Diffusion Policy (3D FDP), a novel framework that leverages scene-level 3D flow as a structured intermediate representation to capture fine-grained local motion cues. Our approach predicts the temporal trajectories of sampled query points and conditions action generation on these interaction-aware flows, implemented jointly within a unified diffusion architecture. This design grounds manipulation in localized dynamics while enabling the policy to reason about broader scene-level consequences of actions. Extensive experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark show that 3D FDP achieves state-of-the-art performance across 50 tasks, particularly excelling on medium and hard settings. Beyond simulation, we validate our method on eight real-robot tasks, where it consistently outperforms prior baselines in contact-rich and non-prehensile scenarios. These results highlight 3D flow as a powerful structural prior for learning generalizable visuomotor policies, supporting the development of more robust and versatile robotic manipulation.

Title: Verification and Synthesis of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Erfan Shakhesi, W.P.M.H. Heemels, Alexander Katriniok
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) have recently attracted interest for guaranteeing safety and synthesizing safe controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.

Title: An overview of neural architectures for self-supervised audio representation learning from masked spectrograms
Authors: Sarthak Yadav, Sergios Theodoridis, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised learning has amassed significant interest for training deep neural representations without labeled data. One such self-supervised learning approach is masked spectrogram modeling, where the objective is to learn semantically rich contextual representations by predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches. Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested readers to make informed decisions regarding suitability of the evaluated approaches to adjacent applications.

Title: Enhancing Automatic Chord Recognition through LLM Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Authors: Chih-Cheng Chang, Bo-Yu Chen, Lu-Rong Chen, Li Su
Abstract: Music Information Retrieval (MIR) encompasses a broad range of computational techniques for analyzing and understanding musical content, with recent deep learning advances driving substantial improvements. Building upon these advances, this paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can serve as an integrative bridge to connect and integrate information from multiple MIR tools, with a focus on enhancing automatic chord recognition performance. We present a novel approach that positions text-based LLMs as intelligent coordinators that process and integrate outputs from diverse state-of-the-art MIR tools-including music source separation, key detection, chord recognition, and beat tracking. Our method converts audio-derived musical information into textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and correction specifically for chord recognition tasks. We design a 5-stage chain-of-thought framework that allows GPT-4o to systematically analyze, compare, and refine chord recognition results by leveraging music-theoretical knowledge to integrate information across different MIR components. Experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, with overall accuracy gains of 1-2.77% on the MIREX metric. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively function as integrative bridges in MIR pipelines, opening new directions for multi-tool coordination in music information retrieval tasks.

Title: Guaranteed Robust Nonlinear MPC via Disturbance Feedback
Authors: Antoine P. Leeman, Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Robots must satisfy safety-critical state and input constraints despite disturbances and model mismatch. We introduce a robust model predictive control (RMPC) formulation that is fast, scalable, and compatible with real-time implementation. Our formulation guarantees robust constraint satisfaction, input-to-state stability (ISS) and recursive feasibility. The key idea is to decompose the uncertain nonlinear system into (i) a nominal nonlinear dynamic model, (ii) disturbance-feedback controllers, and (iii) bounds on the model error. These components are optimized jointly using sequential convex programming. The resulting convex subproblems are solved efficiently using a recent disturbance-feedback MPC solver. The approach is validated across multiple dynamics, including a rocket-landing problem with steerable thrust. An open-source implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: Tractable Approximation of Labeled Multi-Object Posterior Densities
Authors: Thi Hong Thai Nguyen, Ba-Ngu Vo, Ba-Tuong Vo
Abstract: Multi-object estimation in state-space models (SSMs) wherein the system state is represented as a finite set has attracted significant interest in recent years. In Bayesian inference, the posterior density captures all information on the system trajectory since it considers the past history of states. In most multi-object SSM applications, closed-form multi-object posteriors are not available for non-standard multi-object models. Thus, functional approximation is necessary because these posteriors are very high-dimensional. This work provides a tractable multi-scan Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) approximation that matches the trajectory cardinality distribution of the labeled multi-object posterior density. The proposed approximation is also proven to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence over a special class of multi-scan GLMB model. Additionally, we develop a tractable algorithm for computing the approximate multi-object posteriors over finite windows. Numerical experiments, including simulation results on a multi-object SSM with social force model and uninformative observations, are presented to validate the applicability of the approximation method.

Title: Pay More Attention To Audio: Mitigating Imbalance of Cross-Modal Attention in Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Junyu Wang, Ziyang Ma, Zhengding Luo, Tianrui Wang, Meng Ge, Xiaobao Wang, Longbiao Wang
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) often suffer from audio-textual attention imbalance, prioritizing text over acoustic information, particularly in the multi-modal fusion layers of the Transformer architecture. This bias hinders their ability to fully utilize acoustic cues, causing suboptimal performance on audio reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{MATA}, a novel training-free method that dynamically pushes LALMs to pay \textbf{M}ore \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}o \textbf{A}udio tokens within the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring, targeting only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional parameters or computational overhead. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR benchmarks confirm MATA's effectiveness, with consistent performance gains. Notably, on MMAR, MATA enables an open-source model to surpass the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time. Our work provides an efficient solution to mitigate attention bias and opens a new research direction for enhancing the audio-processing capabilities of multi-modal models.

Title: On the Boundary of the Robust Admissible Set in State and Input Constrained Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Franz Rußwurm, Jean Lévine, Stefan Streif
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear control systems subject to bounded disturbances and to both state and input constraints. We introduce the definition of robust admissible set - the set of all initial states from which the state and input constraints can be satisfied for all times against all admissible disturbances. We focus on its boundary that can be decomposed into the usable part on the state constraint boundary and the barrier, interior to the state constraints. We show that, at the intersection of these two components, the boundary of the admissible set must be tangent to the state constraints and separate the interior of the robust admissible set and its complement. Moreover, we prove that the barrier must satisfy a saddle-point principle on a Hamiltonian, in the spirit of Pontryagin's maximum principle, thus providing a direct computational tool. Lastly, we illustrate our results by calculating the robust admissible set for an adaptive cruise control example.

Title: Integrating Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces and Power Control for Dynamic Edge Inference via Over-The-Air Neural Networks
Authors: Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for Edge Inference (EI) that bypasses the conventional practice of treating the wireless channel as noise. We utilize Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIMs) to control wireless propagation, enabling the channel itself to perform over-the-air computation. This eliminates the need for symbol estimation at the receiver, significantly reducing computational and communication overhead. Our approach models the transmitter-channel-receiver system as an end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) where the response of the SIM elements are trainable parameters. To address channel variability, we incorporate a dedicated DNN module responsible for dynamically adjusting transmission power leveraging user location information. Our performance evaluations showcase that the proposed metasurfaces-integrated DNN framework with deep SIM architectures are capable of balancing classification accuracy and power consumption under diverse scenarios, offering significant energy efficiency improvements.

Title: Optimum Spectrum Extension for PAPR Reduction of DFT-s-OFDM
Authors: Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval, Fredrik Berggren, Branislav M. Popovic
Abstract: Uplink coverage in cellular networks is constrained by the maximum UE transmit power, making peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction essential. While DFT-s-OFDM with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS) achieves significantly lower PAPR than OFDM, especially with pi/2-BPSK, the PAPR remains too high for higher-rate transmission. Spectrum extension (SE) combined with FDSS (FDSS-SE) can further reduce the PAPR for higher-order QAM. This paper considers FDSS-SE with parametrized FDSS windows spanning a range of possible power ripples, as well as arbitrary circular shifts of the subcarrier coefficients. We optimize both the frequency shift and the SE size, and show that there exists an optimal SE size for reducing the PAPR and another one for increasing the rate. Analysis and simulations reveal that both optima largely depend on the window attenuation but are nearly invariant in proportion to the bandwidth. While the PAPR-optimal SE size is nearly invariant to the constellation order of regular QAM, the rate-optimal SE size depends also on the SNR. These insights provide practical guidelines for beyond-5G uplink coverage enhancement, highlighting that SE size should be individually configured according to the user's FDSS window and link quality.

Title: WaveletGaussian: Wavelet-domain Diffusion for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Object Reconstruction
Authors: Hung Nguyen, Runfa Li, An Le, Truong Nguyen
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.

Title: Stability and Generalization of Adversarial Diffusion Training
Authors: Hesam Hosseini, Ying Cao, Ali H. Sayed
Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization. While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks, its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression validate these theoretical predictions.

Title: Proactive-reactive detection and mitigation of intermittent faults in robot swarms
Authors: Sinan Oğuz, Emanuele Garone, Marco Dorigo, Mary Katherine Heinrich
Abstract: Intermittent faults are transient errors that sporadically appear and disappear. Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to reliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot swarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that intermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully self-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network topologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently introduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are able to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing the problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in robot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel proactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on self-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network. Proactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur, adapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative positions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare information received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling early fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in a self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the approach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during formation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from disrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection accuracy and low rates of false positives.

Title: A Low-cost Quasi-planar Array Probe for Photoacoustic Imaging
Authors: Xiyu Chen, Junxiang Cai, Rui Zheng, Tao Wu, Fei Gao
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a novel hybrid imaging technique that combines the benefits of both optical and acoustic imaging modalities, which provides functional and molecular optical contrasts of deep tissue. Commonly used ultrasound transducers for PAI include linear and planar arrays, which can provide two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction, respectively. However, linear arrays cannot provide reconstruction of 3D images, which makes it impossible to locate chromophores in 3D space. Although planar array can provide fast 3D imaging in real time, it usually requires thousands of analog-to-digital conversion channels for data acquisition, which is costly. To fill the gap between 2D and 3D PAI, we propose a quasi-planar array that uses double 16-elements-linear arrays arranged in parallel to achieve real-time 3D imaging. We first conducted simulation studies to prove that the quasi-planar probe can perform 3D imaging to localize simple chromophores. Then, the agarose phantom experiment demonstrated that the probe can reconstruct 3D imaging of multiple absorbers in different depths. A potential application of this device is to provide a low-cost 3D PAI solution for fast tracking of needle tip during needle biopsy, which will be further explored in our future work.

Title: Optimization-Based Ramping Reserve Allocation of BESS for AGC Enhancement
Authors: Yiqiao Xu, Alessandra Parisio, Zhongguo Li, Zhen Dong, Zhengtao Ding
Abstract: The transient behavior of Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems is a critical aspect of power system operation. Therefore, fully extracting the potential of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) for AGC enhancement is of paramount importance. In light of the challenges posed by diverse resource interconnections and the variability associated, we propose an online optimization scheme that can adapt to changes in an unknown and variable environment. To leverage the synergy between BESSs and Conventional Generators (CGs), we devise a variant of the Area Injection Error (AIE) as a measure to quantify the ramping needs. Based on this measure, we develop a distributed optimization algorithm with adaptive learning rates for the allocation of the ramping reserve. The algorithm restores a larger learning rate for compliance with the ramping needs upon detecting a potentially destabilizing event. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed scheme through comprehensive case studies. It is shown that the proposed scheme can improve the transient behavior of the AGC system by bridging the gap in ramping capability.

Title: DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in Unsupervised Learning Setup
Authors: Anubhab Ghosh, Antoine Honoré, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.

Title: Neuromorphic Vision Data Coding: Classifying and Reviewing the Literature
Authors: Catarina Brites, João Ascenso
Abstract: In recent years, visual sensors have been quickly improving towards mimicking the visual information acquisition process of human brain by responding to illumination changes as they occur in time rather than at fixed time intervals. In this context, the so-called neuromorphic vision sensors depart from the conventional frame-based image sensors by adopting a paradigm shift in the way visual information is acquired. This new way of visual information acquisition enables faster and asynchronous per-pixel responses/recordings driven by the scene dynamics with a very high dynamic range and low power consumption. However, depending on the application scenario, the emerging neuromorphic vision sensors may generate a large volume of data, thus critically demanding highly efficient coding solutions in order applications may take full advantage of these new, attractive sensors' capabilities. For this reason, considerable research efforts have been invested in recent years towards developing increasingly efficient neuromorphic vision data coding (NVDC) solutions. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of NVDC solutions in the literature, guided by a novel classification taxonomy, which allows better organizing this emerging field. In this way, more solid conclusions can be drawn about the current NVDC status quo, thus allowing to better drive future research and standardization developments in this emerging technical area.

Title: GlaLSTM: A Concurrent LSTM Stream Framework for Glaucoma Detection via Biomarker Mining
Authors: Cheng Huang, Weizheng Xie, Tsengdar Lee, Karanjit Kooner, Ning Zhang, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Glaucoma is a complex group of eye diseases marked by optic nerve damage, commonly linked to elevated intraocular pressure and biomarkers like retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Understanding how these biomarkers interact is crucial for unraveling glaucoma's underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose GlaLSTM, a novel concurrent LSTM stream framework for glaucoma detection, leveraging latent biomarker relationships. Unlike traditional CNN-based models that primarily detect glaucoma from images, GlaLSTM provides deeper interpretability, revealing the key contributing factors and enhancing model transparency. This approach not only improves detection accuracy but also empowers clinicians with actionable insights, facilitating more informed decision-making. Experimental evaluations confirm that GlaLSTM surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential for both advanced biomarker analysis and reliable glaucoma detection.

Title: The Bayesian Separation Principle for Data-driven Control
Authors: Giacomo Baggio, Ruggero Carli, Riccardo Alessandro Grimaldi, Gianluigi Pillonetto
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of a separation principle between model identification and control design in the context of model predictive control. First, we clarify that such a separation principle holds asymptotically in the number of data in a Fisherian context, and show that it holds universally, i.e. regardless of the data size, in a Bayesian context. Then, by formulating model predictive control within a Gaussian regression framework, we describe how the Bayesian separation principle can be used to derive computable, uncertainty-aware expressions for the control cost and optimal input sequence, thereby bridging direct and indirect data-driven approaches. Numerical results in both linear and nonlinear scenarios illustrate that the proposed approach outperform nominal methods that neglect uncertainty, highlighting the advantages of incorporating uncertainty in the control design process.

Title: Distributed Continuous-Time Control via System Level Synthesis
Authors: Yaozhi Du, Jing Shuang Li
Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of H2 and H-Infinity distributed controllers with local communication and local disturbance rejection. We propose a two-step controller design procedure: (1) select closed-loop poles, then (2) optimize over parameterized controllers. Our parameterization builds on the system level synthesis (SLS) formulation -- primarily used in the discrete-time setting -- and extends it to the general continuous-time setting. We verify our approach in simulation on a 9-node grid governed by linearized swing equations, where our distributed controllers (with local communication) achieve performance comparable to that of optimal centralized controllers while facilitating local disturbance rejection.

Title: Saturation-Aware Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithm
Authors: Mengyu Zhao, Shirin Jalali
Abstract: Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses coded masks to compress a 3D data cube into a single 2D snapshot. In practice, multiplexing can push intensities beyond the sensor's dynamic range, producing saturation that violates the linear SCI model and degrades reconstruction. This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of SCI recovery under saturation. We model clipping as an element-wise nonlinearity and derive a finite-sample recovery bound for compression-based SCI that links reconstruction error to mask density and the extent of saturation. The analysis yields a clear design rule: optimal Bernoulli masks use densities below one-half, decreasing further as saturation strengthens. Guided by this principle, we optimize mask patterns and introduce a novel reconstruction framework, Saturation-Aware PnP Net (SAPnet), which explicitly enforces consistency with saturated measurements. Experiments on standard video-SCI benchmarks confirm our theory and demonstrate that SAPnet significantly outperforms existing PnP-based methods.

Title: Low-pass sampling in Model Predictive Path Integral Control
Authors: Piotr Kicki
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a widely used sampling-based approach for real-time control, offering flexibility in handling arbitrary dynamics and cost functions. However, the original MPPI suffers from high-frequency noise in the sampled control trajectories, leading to actuator wear and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce Low-Pass Model Predictive Path Integral Control (LP-MPPI), which integrates low-pass filtering into the sampling process to eliminate detrimental high-frequency components and improve the effectiveness of the control trajectories exploration. Unlike prior approaches, LP-MPPI provides direct and interpretable control over the frequency spectrum of sampled trajectories, enhancing sampling efficiency and control smoothness. Through extensive evaluations in Gymnasium environments, simulated quadruped locomotion, and real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, we demonstrate that LP-MPPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MPPI variants, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing control signal chattering.

Title: SupertonicTTS: Towards Highly Efficient and Streamlined Text-to-Speech System
Authors: Hyeongju Kim, Jinhyeok Yang, Yechan Yu, Seunghun Ji, Jacob Morton, Frederik Bous, Joon Byun, Juheon Lee
Abstract: We introduce SupertonicTTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for efficient and streamlined speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS delivers performance comparable to contemporary zero-shot TTS models with only 44M parameters, while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational cost.

Title: WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators
Authors: Shengpeng Ji, Tianle Liang, Yangzhuo Li, Jialong Zuo, Minghui Fang, Jinzheng He, Yifu Chen, Zhengqing Liu, Ziyue Jiang, Xize Cheng, Siqi Zheng, Jin Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward.

Title: UAV-Enabled Passive 6D Movable Antenna for ISAC: Joint Location, Orientation, and Reflection Optimization
Authors: Peilan Wang, Yu Xue, Weidong Mei, Jun Fang, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms other baseline schemes.

Title: UltraBoneUDF: Self-supervised Bone Surface Reconstruction from Ultrasound Based on Neural Unsigned Distance Functions
Authors: Luohong Wu, Matthias Seibold, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Giuseppe Loggia, Lisa Reissner, Bastian Sigrist, Jonas Hein, Lilian Calvet, Arnd Viehöfer, Philipp Fürnstahl
Abstract: Bone surface reconstruction is an essential component of computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), forming the foundation for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound provides a radiation-free, and cost-effective alternative. While ultrasound offers new opportunities in CAOS, technical shortcomings continue to hinder its translation into surgery. In particular, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically capture only partial bone surfaces, posing major challenges for surface reconstruction. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such incomplete data, leading to increased reconstruction errors and artifacts. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework specifically designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound data using neural unsigned distance functions (UDFs). In addition, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and competing models are benchmarked on three open-source datasets and further evaluated through ablation studies. Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 0.96 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (28.9% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art), 0.21 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset (40.0% improvement), and 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset (63.3% improvement).

Title: When and How Long Did Therapy Happen? Soft-Supervising Temporal Localization Using Audio-Language Models
Authors: Suhas BN, Andrew M. Sherrill, Jyoti Alaparthi, Dominik Mattioli, Rosa I. Arriaga, Chris W. Wiese, Saeed Abdullah
Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements, identifying their start and stop times, directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases, therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3), are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 308 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3s across tasks, within typical rater tolerance for timestamp review, enabling practical fidelity QC. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation.

Title: Chirp-Permuted AFDM: A Versatile Waveform Design for ISAC in 6G
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu
Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) - including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or signaling overhead.

Title: Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Pin-Qi Fu, Walid Saad, Li-Chun Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.

Title: mRadNet: A Compact Radar Object Detector with MetaFormer
Authors: Huaiyu Chen, Fahed Hassanat, Robert Laganiere, Martin Bouchard
Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and FLOPs.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an essential tool for diagnosing breast lesions, with millions of examinations per year. However, publicly available high-quality BUS benchmarks for AI development are limited in data scale and annotation richness. In this work, we present BUS-CoT, a BUS dataset for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning analysis, which contains 11,439 images of 10,019 lesions from 4,838 patients and covers all 99 histopathology types. To facilitate research on incentivizing CoT reasoning, we construct the reasoning processes based on observation, feature, diagnosis and pathology labels, annotated and verified by experienced experts. Moreover, by covering lesions of all histopathology types, we aim to facilitate robust AI systems in rare cases, which can be error-prone in clinical practice.

Title: FUN-SSL: Full-band Layer Followed by U-Net with Narrow-band Layers for Multiple Moving Sound Source Localization
Authors: Yuseon Choi, Hyeonseung Kim, Jewoo Jun, Jong Won Shin
Abstract: Dual-path processing along the temporal and spectral dimensions has shown to be effective in various speech processing applications. While the sound source localization (SSL) models utilizing dual-path processing such as the FN-SSL and IPDnet demonstrated impressive performances in localizing multiple moving sources, they require significant amount of computation. In this paper, we propose an architecture for SSL which introduces a U-Net to perform narrow-band processing in multiple resolutions to reduce computational complexity. The proposed model replaces the full-narrow network block in the IPDnet consisting of one full-band LSTM layer along the spectral dimension followed by one narrow-band LSTM layer along the temporal dimension with the FUN block composed of one Full-band layer followed by a U-net with Narrow-band layers in multiple scales. On top of the skip connections within each U-Net, we also introduce the skip connections between FUN blocks to enrich information. Experimental results showed that the proposed FUN-SSL outperformed previously proposed approaches with computational complexity much lower than that of the IPDnet.

Title: Addressing Model Inaccuracies in Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Diverse Alternatives
Authors: Paul Bannmüller, Périne Cunat, Ali Rajaei, Jochen Cremer
Abstract: The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested remedial actions.

Title: Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Zhaolin Wang, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.

Title: Fix your downsampling ASAP! Be natively more robust via Aliasing and Spectral Artifact free Pooling
Authors: Julia Grabinski, Steffen Jung, Janis Keuper, Margret Keuper
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successful in various computer vision tasks. From an image and signal processing point of view, this success is counter-intuitive, as the inherent spatial pyramid design of most CNNs is apparently violating basic signal processing laws, i.e. the Sampling Theorem in their downsampling operations. This issue has been broadly neglected until recent work in the context of adversarial attacks and distribution shifts showed that there is a strong correlation between the vulnerability of CNNs and aliasing artifacts induced by bandlimit-violating downsampling. As a remedy, we propose an alias-free downsampling operation in the frequency domain, denoted Frequency Low Cut Pooling (FLC Pooling) which we further extend to Aliasing and Sinc Artifact-free Pooling (ASAP). ASAP is alias-free and removes further artifacts from sinc-interpolation. Our experimental evaluation on ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-C and CIFAR datasets on various CNN architectures demonstrates that networks using FLC Pooling and ASAP as downsampling methods learn more stable features as measured by their robustness against common corruptions and adversarial attacks, while maintaining a clean accuracy similar to the respective baseline models.

Title: Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data
Authors: Xiwei Zhang, Yan Chen, Tao Li
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path and decompose the tracking error of the algorithm's output for the regularization path into random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences. Investigating the mean square asymptotic stability of the equations, we show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying, then the algorithm's output achieves mean square consistency with the regularization path. Leveraging operator theory, particularly the monotonicity of the inverses of operators and the spectral decomposition of compact operators, we introduce the RKHS persistence of excitation condition (i.e. there exists a fixed-length time period, such that the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every period has a uniformly strictly positive compact lower bound) and develop a dominated convergence method to prove the mean square consistency between the algorithm's output and an unknown function. Finally, for independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency if the input data's marginal probability measures are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.

Title: Compositional Phoneme Approximation for L1-Grounded L2 Pronunciation Training
Authors: Jisang Park, Minu Kim, DaYoung Hong, Jongha Lee
Abstract: Learners of a second language (L2) often map non-native phonemes with similar native-language (L1) phonemes, making conventional L2-focused training slow and effortful. To address this, we propose an L1-grounded pronunciation training method based on compositional phoneme approximation (CPA), a feature-based representation technique that approximates L2 sounds with sequences of L1 phonemes. Evaluations with 20 Korean non-native English speakers show that CPA-based training achieves a 76% in-box formant rate in acoustic analysis, over 20% relative improvement in phoneme recognition accuracy, and over 80% of speech being rated as more native-like, with minimal training.

Title: Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings
Authors: Neophytos Charalambides, Arya Mazumdar
Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.

Title: DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning
Authors: Zhuoyuan Mao, Mengjie Zhao, Qiyu Wu, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-LLM fusion Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We open-source the codes, models and datasets we constructed: this http URL.

Title: An Efficient Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Sequence EEG Modeling
Authors: Jiazhen Hong, Geoffrey Mackellar, Soheila Ghane
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generally exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability, making generalization across subjects and domains challenging. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning with Transformer-based architectures, have shown promise in EEG representation learning. However, their quadratic computational complexity increases memory usage and slows inference, making them inefficient for modeling long-range dependencies. Moreover, most existing approaches emphasize either explicit window segmentation of the temporal signal or spectral-only input embedding while neglecting raw temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 adopts a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Mamba-2 to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Meanwhile, the selective information propagation mechanism of Mamba-2 enables the model to effectively capture and preserve long-range dependencies in raw EEG signals, where traditional RNN or CNN architectures often struggle. Moreover, EEGM2 employs a self-supervised pre-training objective that reconstructs raw EEG using a combined L1 and spectral (Fourier-based) loss, enhancing generalization by jointly preserving temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that EEGM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-sequence modeling and classification. Further evaluations show that EEGM2 consistently outperforms existing models, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and tasks, as well as transferability across domains. Overall, EEGM2 offers an efficient and scalable solution suitable for deployment on resource-constrained brain-computer interface (BCI) devices.

Title: Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments
Authors: Minzhe Zheng, Lei Zheng, Lei Zhu, Jun Ma
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.

Title: Stratified Topological Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC)
Authors: Cora A. Duggan, Adam Goertz, Adam Polevoy, Mark Gonzales, Kevin C. Wolfe, Bradley Woosley, John G. Rogers III, Joseph Moore
Abstract: In this paper, we present Stratified Topological Autonomy for Long-Range Coordination (STALC), a hierarchical planning approach for coordinated multi-robot maneuvering in real-world environments with significant inter-robot spatial and temporal dependencies. At its core, STALC consists of a multi-robot graph-based planner which combines a topological graph with a novel, computationally efficient mixed-integer programming formulation to generate highly-coupled multi-robot plans in seconds. To enable autonomous planning across different spatial and temporal scales, we construct our graphs so that they capture connectivity between free-space regions and other problem-specific features, such as traversability or risk. We then use receding-horizon planners to achieve local collision avoidance and formation control. To evaluate our approach, we consider a multi-robot reconnaissance scenario where robots must autonomously coordinate to navigate through an environment while minimizing the risk of detection by observers. Through simulation-based experiments, we show that our approach is able to scale to address complex multi-robot planning scenarios. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate our ability to generate graphs from real-world data and successfully plan across the entire hierarchy to achieve shared objectives.

Title: Sliding Speed Influences Electrovibration-Induced Finger Friction Dynamics on Touchscreens
Authors: Jagan K Balasubramanian, Daan M Pool, Yasemin Vardar
Abstract: Electrovibration technology enables tactile texture rendering on capacitive touchscreens by modulating friction between the finger and the screen through electrostatic attraction forces, generated by applying an alternating voltage signal to the screen. Accurate signal calibration is essential for robust texture rendering but remains challenging due to variations in sliding speed, applied force, and individual skin mechanics, all of which unpredictably affect frictional behavior. Here, we investigate how exploration conditions affect electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens and the role of skin mechanics in this process. Ten participants slid their index fingers across an electrovibration-enabled touchscreen at five sliding speeds ($20\sim100$ mm/s) and applied force levels ($0.2\sim0.6$ N). Contact forces and skin accelerations were measured while amplitude modulated voltage signals spanning the tactile frequency range were applied to the screen. We modeled the finger-touchscreen friction response as a first-order system and the skin mechanics as a mass-spring-damper system. Results showed that sliding speed influenced the friction response's cutoff frequency, along with the estimated finger moving mass and stiffness. For every $1$ mm/s increase in speed, the cutoff frequency, the finger moving mass, and stiffness increased by $13.8$ Hz, $3.23\times 10^{-5}$ kg, and $4.04$ N/m, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that finger stiffness had a greater impact on the cutoff frequency than moving mass. Notably, we observed a substantial inter-participant variability in both finger-display interaction and skin mechanics parameters. Finally, we developed a speed-dependent friction model to support consistent and perceptually stable electrovibration-based haptic feedback across varying user conditions.

Title: Large Language Models Implicitly Learn to See and Hear Just By Reading
Authors: Prateek Verma, Mert Pilanci
Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Abstract: Recently, Kvalheim and Sontag provided a generalized global Hartman-Grobman theorem for equilibria under asymptotically stable continuous vector fields. By leveraging topological properties of Lyapunov functions, their theorem works without assuming hyperbolicity. We extend their theorem to a class of possibly discontinuous vector fields, in particular, to vector fields generating asymptotically stable semiflows.

Title: A Vision for Trustworthy, Fair, and Efficient Socio-Technical Control using Karma Economies
Authors: Ezzat Elokda, Andrea Censi, Emilio Frazzoli, Florian Dörfler, Saverio Bolognani
Abstract: Control systems will play a pivotal role in addressing societal-scale challenges as they drive the development of sustainable future smart cities. At the heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy, transportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that monetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity -- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this vision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary mechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of many socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting resource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we review related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a case for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and static to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as the formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts. We show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize long-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart city built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different socio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single karma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new flexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.

Title: Robust Energy-Efficient DRL-Based Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS Systems with Jitter
Authors: Mahmoud M. Salim, Khaled M. Rabie, Ali H. Muqaibel
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient design for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication system with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) and UAV jitter. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the 53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL baselines.

Title: LogicGuard: Improving Embodied LLM agents through Temporal Logic based Critics
Authors: Anand Gokhale, Vaibhav Srivastava, Francesco Bullo
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in zero-shot and single step reasoning and decision making problems, but in long horizon sequential planning tasks, their errors compound, often leading to unreliable or inefficient behavior. We introduce LogicGuard, a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by a trajectory level LLM critic that communicates through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. LogicGuard supports both fixed safety rules and adaptive, learned constraints, and is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, with LogicGuard acting as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LogicGuard to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. To demonstrate generality, we evaluate LogicGuard across two distinct settings: short-horizon general tasks and long-horizon specialist tasks. On the Behavior benchmark of 100 household tasks, LogicGuard increases task completion rates by 25% over a baseline InnerMonologue planner. On the Minecraft diamond-mining task, which is long-horizon and requires multiple interdependent subgoals, LogicGuard improves both efficiency and safety compared to SayCan and InnerMonologue. These results show that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through temporal logic yields more reliable, efficient and safe decision-making for both embodied agents.

Title: DWTGS: Rethinking Frequency Regularization for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Hung Nguyen, Runfa Li, An Le, Truong Nguyen
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Title: Efficient Sub-pixel Motion Compensation in Learned Video Codecs
Authors: Théo Ladune, Thomas Leguay, Pierrick Philippe, Gordon Clare, Félix Henry
Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs (HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel.

Title: Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen
Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.

Title: Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Abigail McClain Gomez, Liyuan Chen, Aaron Trowbridge, Andy J. Goldschmidt, Zachary Manchester, Frederic T. Chong, Arthur Jaffe, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Title: Drift Plus Optimistic Penalty - A Learning Framework for Stochastic Network Optimization with Improved Regret Bounds
Authors: Sathwik Chadaga, Eytan Modiano
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks, where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off, however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its regret is indeed sub-linear.

Title: PoolingVQ: A VQVAE Variant for Reducing Audio Redundancy and Boosting Multi-Modal Fusion in Music Emotion Analysis
Authors: Dinghao Zou, Yicheng Gong, Xiaokang Li, Xin Cao, Sunbowen Lee
Abstract: Multimodal music emotion analysis leverages both audio and MIDI modalities to enhance performance. While mainstream approaches focus on complex feature extraction networks, we propose that shortening the length of audio sequence features to mitigate redundancy, especially in contrast to MIDI's compact representation, may effectively boost task performance. To achieve this, we developed PoolingVQ by combining Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) with spatial pooling, which directly compresses audio feature sequences through codebook-guided local aggregation to reduce redundancy, then devised a two-stage co-attention approach to fuse audio and MIDI information. Experimental results on the public datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI demonstrate that our multimodal framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with PoolingVQ yielding effective improvement. Our proposed metho's code is available at Anonymous GitHub

Title: L2M-Reg: Building-level Uncertainty-aware Registration of Outdoor LiDAR Point Clouds and Semantic 3D City Models
Authors: Ziyang Xu, Benedikt Schwab, Yihui Yang, Thomas H. Kolbe, Christoph Holst
Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction, change detection and model refinement. However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.
