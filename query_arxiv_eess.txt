Title: 3D Object Reconstruction with mmWave Radars
Authors: Samah Hussein, Junfeng Guan, Swathi Narashiman, Saurabh Gupta, Haitham Hassanieh
Abstract: This paper presents RFconstruct, a framework that enables 3D shape reconstruction using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radars for self-driving scenarios. RFconstruct overcomes radar limitations of low angular resolution, specularity, and sparsity in radar point clouds through a holistic system design that addresses hardware, data processing, and machine learning challenges. The first step is fusing data captured by two radar devices that image orthogonal planes, then performing odometry-aware temporal fusion to generate denser 3D point clouds. RFconstruct then reconstructs 3D shapes of objects using a customized encoder-decoder model that does not require prior knowledge of the object's bound box. The shape reconstruction performance of RFconstruct is compared against 3D models extracted from a depth camera equipped with a LiDAR. We show that RFconstruct can accurately generate 3D shapes of cars, bikes, and pedestrians.

Title: WaterFlow: Learning Fast & Robust Watermarks using Stable Diffusion
Authors: Vinay Shukla, Prachee Sharma, Ryan Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Tong Yu, Aditya Grover
Abstract: The ability to embed watermarks in images is a fundamental problem of interest for computer vision, and is exacerbated by the rapid rise of generated imagery in recent times. Current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from computational and statistical challenges such as the slow execution speed for practical deployments. In addition, other works trade off fast watermarking speeds but suffer greatly in their robustness or perceptual quality. In this work, we propose WaterFlow (WF), a fast and extremely robust approach for high fidelity visual watermarking based on a learned latent-dependent watermark. Our approach utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model to encode an arbitrary image into a latent space and produces a learned watermark that is then planted into the Fourier Domain of the latent. The transformation is specified via invertible flow layers that enhance the expressivity of the latent space of the pre-trained model to better preserve image quality while permitting robust and tractable detection. Most notably, WaterFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on general robustness and is the first method capable of effectively defending against difficult combination attacks. We validate our findings on three widely used real and generated datasets: MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt.

Title: Regist3R: Incremental Registration with Stereo Foundation Model
Authors: Sidun Liu, Wenyu Li, Peng Qiao, Yong Dou
Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.

Title: Benchmarking Audio Deepfake Detection Robustness in Real-world Communication Scenarios
Authors: Haohan Shi, Xiyu Shi, Safak Dogan, Saif Alzubi, Tianjin Huang, Yunxiao Zhang
Abstract: Existing Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) systems often struggle to generalise effectively due to the significantly degraded audio quality caused by audio codec compression and channel transmission effects in real-world communication scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed a rigorous benchmark to evaluate ADD system performance under such scenarios. We introduced ADD-C, a new test dataset to evaluate the robustness of ADD systems under diverse communication conditions, including different combinations of audio codecs for compression and Packet Loss Rates (PLR). Benchmarking on three baseline ADD models with the ADD-C dataset demonstrated a significant decline in robustness under such conditions. A novel data augmentation strategy was proposed to improve the robustness of ADD systems. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach increases the performance of ADD systems significantly with the proposed ADD-C dataset. Our benchmark can assist future efforts towards building practical and robustly generalisable ADD systems.

Title: Attention-Infused Autoencoder for Massive MIMO CSI Compression
Authors: Kangzhi Lou, Xiping Wu
Abstract: As the number of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas increases drastically with the development towards 6G systems, channel state information (CSI) compression becomes crucial for mitigating feedback overhead. In recent years, learning models such as autoencoders (AE) have been studied for CSI compression, aiming to eliminate model assumptions and reduce compression loss. However, current learning methods are often designed and trained mainly for individual channel scenarios, with limited generalizability across different scenarios, of which the channel characteristics are prominently discrepant. Motivated by this, we propose a novel AE-based learning method named attention-infused autoencoder network (AiANet), which can parallelly and adaptively extract channel-wise and spatial features of CSI with an attention fusion mechanism. In addition, a locally-aware self-attention mechanism is developed to extract both global and local spatial patterns, to better capture the unique CSI features of different scenarios. Moreover, a mixed-training scheme is introduced to enable the proposed AiANet to gain generalizability across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Results show that when trained and tested in the same scenario, AiANet can substantially outperform the existing AE-based methods such as ACRNet, with an improvement of up to 3.42 dB in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE). With the mixed-training scheme, AiANet exhibits superior cross-scenario generalizability compared to the benchmark methods which are trained in one scenario and misused in another.

Title: Enhanced Battery Capacity Estimation in Data-Limited Scenarios through Swarm Learning
Authors: Jiawei Zhang, Yu Zhang, Wei Xu, Yifei Zhang, Weiran Jiang, Qi Jiao, Yao Ren, Ziyou Song
Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased, feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are available.

Title: GLUSE: Enhanced Channel-Wise Adaptive Gated Linear Units SE for Onboard Satellite Earth Observation Image Classification
Authors: Thanh-Dung Le, Vu Nguyen Ha, Ti Ti Nguyen, Geoffrey Eappen, Prabhu Thiruvasagam, Hong-fu Chou, Duc-Dung Tran, Hung Nguyen-Kha, Luis M. Garces-Socarras, Jorge L. Gonzalez-Rios, Juan Carlos Merlano-Duncan, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: This study introduces ResNet-GLUSE, a lightweight ResNet variant enhanced with Gated Linear Unit-enhanced Squeeze-and-Excitation (GLUSE), an adaptive channel-wise attention mechanism. By integrating dynamic gating into the traditional SE framework, GLUSE improves feature recalibration while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on EuroSAT and PatternNet datasets confirm its effectiveness, achieving exceeding \textbf{94\% and 98\% accuracy}, respectively. While \textbf{MobileViT achieves 99\% accuracy}, ResNet-GLUSE offers \textbf{33x fewer parameters, 27x fewer FLOPs, 33x smaller model size (MB), $\approx$6x lower power consumption (W), and $\approx$3x faster inference time (s)}, making it significantly more efficient for onboard satellite deployment. Furthermore, due to its simplicity, ResNet-GLUSE can be easily mimicked for \textbf{neuromorphic computing}, enabling ultra-low power inference at just \textbf{852.30 mW} on Akida Brainchip. This balance between high accuracy and ultra-low resource consumption establishes ResNet-GLUSE as a practical solution for real-time Earth Observation (EO) tasks. Reproducible codes are available in our shared repository.

Title: Robust Visual Servoing under Human Supervision for Assembly Tasks
Authors: Victor Nan Fernandez-Ayala, Jorge Silva, Meng Guo, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: We propose a framework enabling mobile manipulators to reliably complete pick-and-place tasks for assembling structures from construction blocks. The picking uses an eye-in-hand visual servoing controller for object tracking with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure fiducial markers in the blocks remain visible. An additional robot with an eye-to-hand setup ensures precise placement, critical for structural stability. We integrate human-in-the-loop capabilities for flexibility and fault correction and analyze robustness to camera pose errors, proposing adapted barrier functions to handle them. Lastly, experiments validate the framework on 6-DoF mobile arms.

Title: Optimizing Utility-Scale Solar Siting for Local Economic Benefits and Regional Decarbonization
Authors: Papa Yaw Owusu-Obeng, Steven R. Miller, Sarah Banas Mills, Michael T. Craig
Abstract: The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to $34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by 2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by 39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5% in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.

Title: Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Rectangular Index Coefficients
Authors: Saulo Queiroz, João P. Vilela, Benjamin Koon Kei Ng, Chan-Tong Lam, Edmundo Monteiro
Abstract: In~\cite{sic-magazine-2025}, the authors show that the square index coefficients (SICs) of the \(N\)-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) -- that is, the coefficients \(X_{k\sqrt{N}}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, \sqrt{N} - 1\) -- can be losslessly compressed from \(N\) to \(\sqrt{N}\) points, thereby accelerating the computation of these specific DFT coefficients accordingly. Following up on that, in this article we generalize SICs into what we refer to as rectangular index coefficients (RICs) of the DFT, formalized as $X_{kL}, k=0,1,\cdots,C-1$, in which the integers $C$ and $L$ are generic roots of $N$ such that $N=LC$. We present an algorithm to compress the $N$-point input signal $\mathbf{x}$ into a $C$-point signal $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ at the expense of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complex sums and no complex multiplication. We show that a DFT on $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ is equivalent to a DFT on the RICs of $\mathbf{x}$. In cases where specific frequencies of \(\mathbf{x}\) are of interest -- as in harmonic analysis -- one can conveniently adjust the signal parameters (e.g., frequency resolution) to align the RICs with those frequencies, and use the proposed algorithm to compute them significantly faster. If $N$ is a power of two -- as required by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm -- then $C$ can be any power of two in the range $[2, N/2]$ and one can use our algorithm along with FFT to compute all RICs in $\mathcal{O}(C\log C)$ time complexity.

Title: Sub-Scalp Brain-Computer Interface Device Design and Fabrication
Authors: Timothy B. Mahoney, David B. Grayden, Sam E. John
Abstract: Current brain-computer interfaces (BCI) face limitations in signal acquisition. While sub-scalp EEG offers a potential solution, existing devices prioritize chronic seizure monitoring and lack features suited for BCI applications. This work addresses this gap by outlining key specifications for sub-scalp BCI devices, focusing on channel count, sampling rate, power efficiency, and form factor. We present the Set-And-Forget EEG (SAFE) system, a custom-built amplifier and wireless transmitter meeting these criteria. This compact (12x12 mm), six-channel device offers 1024 Hz sampling and Bluetooth Low Energy data transmission. Validation using generated sinusoids and electrocorticography recordings of visual evoked potentials in sheep models demonstrated low noise recording. Future animal studies will assess sub-scalp EEG signal quality for BCI applications. This data lays the groundwork for human trials, ultimately paving the way for chronic, in-home BCIs that empower individuals with physical disabilities.

Title: Temporal Attention Pooling for Frequency Dynamic Convolution in Sound Event Detection
Authors: Hyeonuk Nam, Yong-Hwa Park
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly frequency dynamic convolution (FDY conv), have significantly improved sound event detection (SED) by enabling frequency-adaptive feature extraction. However, FDY conv relies on temporal average pooling, which treats all temporal frames equally, limiting its ability to capture transient sound events such as alarm bells, door knocks, and speech plosives. To address this limitation, we propose temporal attention pooling frequency dynamic convolution (TFD conv) to replace temporal average pooling with temporal attention pooling (TAP). TAP adaptively weights temporal features through three complementary mechanisms: time attention pooling (TA) for emphasizing salient features, velocity attention pooling (VA) for capturing transient changes, and conventional average pooling for robustness to stationary signals. Ablation studies show that TFD conv improves average PSDS1 by 3.02% over FDY conv with only a 14.8% increase in parameter count. Classwise ANOVA and Tukey HSD analysis further demonstrate that TFD conv significantly enhances detection performance for transient-heavy events, outperforming existing FDY conv models. Notably, TFD conv achieves a maximum PSDS1 score of 0.456, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SED systems. We also explore the compatibility of TAP with other FDY conv variants, including dilated FDY conv (DFD conv), partial FDY conv (PFD conv), and multi-dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv). Among these, the integration of TAP with MDFD conv achieves the best result with a PSDS1 score of 0.459, validating the complementary strengths of temporal attention and multi-scale frequency adaptation. These findings establish TFD conv as a powerful and generalizable framework for enhancing both transient sensitivity and overall feature robustness in SED.

Title: High-Resolution Multipath Angle Estimation Based on Power-Angle-Delay Profile for Directional Scanning Sounding
Authors: Huixin Xu, Jianhua Zhang, Pan Tang, Hongbo Xing, Lei Tian, Qixing Wang
Abstract: Directional scanning sounding (DSS) has become widely adopted for high-frequency channel measurements because it effectively compensates for severe path loss. However, the resolution of existing multipath component (MPC) angle estimation methods is constrained by the DSS angle sampling interval. Therefore, this communication proposes a high-resolution MPC angle estimation method based on power-angle-delay profile (PADP) for DSS. By exploiting the mapping relationship between the power difference of adjacent angles in the PADP and MPC offset angle, the resolution of MPC angle estimation is refined, significantly enhancing the accuracy of MPC angle and amplitude estimation without increasing measurement complexity. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the mean squared estimation errors of angle and amplitude by one order of magnitude compared to traditional omnidirectional synthesis methods. Furthermore, the estimation errors approach the Cramér-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) derived for wideband DSS, thereby validating its superior performance in MPC angle and amplitude estimation. Finally, experiments conducted in an indoor scenario at 37.5 GHz validate the excellent performance of the proposed method in practical applications.

Title: Spike-Kal: A Spiking Neuron Network Assisted Kalman Filter
Authors: Xun Xiao, Junbo Tie, Jinyue Zhao, Ziqi Wang, Yuan Li, Qiang Dou, Lei Wang
Abstract: Kalman filtering can provide an optimal estimation of the system state from noisy observation data. This algorithm's performance depends on the accuracy of system modeling and noise statistical characteristics, which are usually challenging to obtain in practical applications. The powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep learning, combined with its ability to extract features from large amounts of data automatically, offer new opportunities for improving the Kalman filter. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages the Spiking Neural Network to optimize the Kalman filter. Our approach aims to reduce the reliance on prior knowledge of system and observation noises, allowing for adaptation to varying statistical characteristics of time-varying noise. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of SNNs in improving the computational efficiency of the Kalman filter. In our method, we design an integration strategy between the SNN and the Kalman filter. The SNN is trained to directly approximate the optimal gain matrix from observation data, thereby alleviating the computational burden of complex matrix operations inherent in traditional Kalman filtering while maintaining the accuracy and robustness of state estimation. Its average error has been reduced by 18\%-65\% compared with other methods.

Title: TUMLS: Trustful Fully Unsupervised Multi-Level Segmentation for Whole Slide Images of Histology
Authors: Walid Rehamnia, Alexandra Getmanskaya, Evgeniy Vasilyev, Vadim Turlapov
Abstract: Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However, challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs), high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology (TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It selects representative patches from each identified group based on an uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially, this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016. Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset, outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in advancing the field of digital pathology.

Title: Incorporating a Deep Neural Network into Moving Horizon Estimation for Embedded Thermal Torque Derating of an Electric Machine
Authors: Alexander Winkler, Pranav Shah, Katrin Baumgärtner, Vasu Sharma, David Gordon, Jakob Andert
Abstract: This study introduces a novel state estimation framework that incorporates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE), shifting from traditional physics-based models to rapidly developed data-driven techniques. A DNN model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) nodes is trained on synthetic data generated by a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM), which undergoes thermal derating as part of the torque control strategy in a battery electric vehicle. The MHE is constructed by integrating the trained DNN with a simplified driving dynamics model in a discrete-time formulation, incorporating the LSTM hidden and cell states in the state vector to retain system dynamics. The resulting optimal control problem (OCP) is formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) and implemented using the acados framework. Model-in-the-loop (MiL) simulations demonstrate accurate temperature estimation, even under noisy sensor conditions or failures. Achieving threefold real-time capability on embedded hardware confirms the feasibility of the approach for practical deployment. The primary focus of this study is to assess the feasibility of the MHE framework using a DNN-based plant model instead of focusing on quantitative comparisons of vehicle performance. Overall, this research highlights the potential of DNN-based MHE for real-time, safety-critical applications by combining the strengths of model-based and data-driven methods.

Title: Universal Approximation with XL MIMO Systems: OTA Classification via Trainable Analog Combining
Authors: Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator, similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low power wireless devices.

Authors: Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, Giyyarpuram Madhusudan, Guillaume Jornod, Sami Mekki, Francesca Costanzo, Hui Chen, Placido Mursia, Maurizio Crozzoli, Emilio Calvanese Strinati, George C. Alexandropoulos, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: The Distributed Intelligent Sensing and Communication (DISAC) framework redefines Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for 6G by leveraging distributed architectures to enhance scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. This paper presents key architectural enablers, including advanced data representation, seamless target handover, support for heterogeneous devices, and semantic integration. Two use cases illustrate the transformative potential of DISAC: smart factory shop floors and Vulnerable Road User (VRU) protection at smart intersections. These scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in precision, safety, and operational efficiency compared to traditional ISAC systems. The preliminary DISAC architecture incorporates intelligent data processing, distributed coordination, and emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to meet 6G's stringent requirements. By addressing critical challenges in sensing accuracy, latency, and real-time decision-making, DISAC positions itself as a cornerstone for next-generation wireless networks, advancing innovation in dynamic and complex environments.

Title: Supporting Urban Low-Altitude Economy: Channel Gain Map Inference Based on 3D Conditional GAN
Authors: Yonghao Wang, Ruoguang Li, Di Wu, Jiaqi Chen, Yong Zeng
Abstract: The advancement of advanced air mobility (AAM) in recent years has given rise to the concept of low-altitude economy (LAE). However, the diverse flight activities associated with the emerging LAE applications in urban scenarios confront complex physical environments, which urgently necessitates ubiquitous and reliable communication to guarantee the operation safety of the low-altitude aircraft. As one of promising technologies for the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks, channel knowledge map (CKM) enables the environment-aware communication by constructing a site-specific dataset, thereby providing a priori on-site information for the aircraft to obtain the channel state information (CSI) at arbitrary locations with much reduced online overhead. Diverse base station (BS) deployments in the three-dimensional (3D) urban low-altitude environment require efficient 3D CKM construction to capture spatial channel characteristics with less overhead. Towards this end, this paper proposes a 3D channel gain map (CGM) inference method based on a 3D conditional generative adversarial network (3D-CGAN). Specifically, we first analyze the potential deployment types of BSs in urban low-altitude scenario, and investigate the CGM representation with the corresponding 3D channel gain model. The framework of the proposed 3D-CGAN is then discussed, which is trained by a dataset consisting of existing CGMs. Consequently, the trained 3D-CGAN is capable of inferring the corresponding CGM only based on the BS coordinate without additional measurement. The simulation results demonstrate that the CGMs inferred by the proposed 3D-CGAN outperform those of the benchmark schemes, which can accurately reflect the radio propagation condition in 3D environment.

Title: EmoVoice: LLM-based Emotional Text-To-Speech Model with Freestyle Text Prompting
Authors: Guanrou Yang, Chen Yang, Qian Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Wen Wang, Tianrui Wang, Yifan Yang, Zhikang Niu, Wenrui Liu, Fan Yu, Zhihao Du, Zhifu Gao, ShiLiang Zhang, Xie Chen
Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at this https URL. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.

Title: CST-former: Multidimensional Attention-based Transformer for Sound Event Localization and Detection in Real Scenes
Authors: Yusun Shul, Dayun Choi, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) is a task for the classification of sound events and the identification of direction of arrival (DoA) utilizing multichannel acoustic signals. For effective classification and localization, a channel-spectro-temporal transformer (CST-former) was suggested. CST-former employs multidimensional attention mechanisms across the spatial, spectral, and temporal domains to enlarge the model's capacity to learn the domain information essential for event detection and DoA estimation over time. In this work, we present an enhanced version of CST-former with multiscale unfolded local embedding (MSULE) developed to capture and aggregate domain information over multiple time-frequency scales. Also, we propose finetuning and post-processing techniques beneficial for conducting the SELD task over limited training datasets. In-depth ablation studies of the proposed architecture and detailed analysis on the proposed modules are carried out to validate the efficacy of multidimensional attentions on the SELD task. Empirical validation through experimentation on STARSS22 and STARSS23 datasets demonstrates the remarkable performance of CST-former and post-processing techniques without using external data.

Title: Market-Driven Flexibility Provision: A Tri-Level Optimization Approach for Carbon Reduction
Authors: Shijie Pan, Gerrit Rolofs, Luca Pontecorvi, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can reduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty and intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power systems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time electricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These discrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the early hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but higher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive framework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets and aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed approach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization model, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return, receive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model ensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and end-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system, supported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer behaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in guiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.

Title: RIS-Assisted Beamfocusing in Near-Field IoT Communication Systems: A Transformer-Based Approach
Authors: Quan Zhou, Jingjing Zhao, Kaiquan Cai, Yanbo Zhu
Abstract: The massive number of antennas in extremely large aperture array (ELAA) systems shifts the propagation regime of signals in internet of things (IoT) communication systems towards near-field spherical wave propagation. We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted beamfocusing mechanism, where the design of the two-dimensional beam codebook that contains both the angular and distance domains is challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Transformer-based two-stage beam training algorithm, which includes the coarse and fine search phases. The proposed mechanism provides a fine-grained codebook with enhanced spatial resolution, enabling precise beamfocusing. Specifically, in the first stage, the beam training is performed to estimate the approximate location of the device by using a simple codebook, determining whether it is within the beamfocusing range (BFR) or the none-beamfocusing range (NBFR). In the second stage, by using a more precise codebook, a fine-grained beam search strategy is conducted. Experimental results unveil that the precision of the RIS-assisted beamfocusing is greatly improved. The proposed method achieves beam selection accuracy up to 97% at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, and improves 10% to 50% over the baseline method at different SNRs.

Title: Safe Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Dynamics and Control
Authors: Jan Drgona, Truong X. Nghiem, Thomas Beckers, Mahyar Fazlyab, Enrique Mallada, Colin Jones, Draguna Vrabie, Steven L. Brunton, Rolf Findeisen
Abstract: This tutorial paper focuses on safe physics-informed machine learning in the context of dynamics and control, providing a comprehensive overview of how to integrate physical models and safety guarantees. As machine learning techniques enhance the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems, ensuring safety and stability remains a critical challenge, especially in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical decision-making, and energy systems. We explore various approaches for embedding and ensuring safety constraints, such as structural priors, Lyapunov functions, Control Barrier Functions, predictive control, projections, and robust optimization techniques, ensuring that the learned models respect stability and safety criteria. Additionally, we delve into methods for uncertainty quantification and safety verification, including reachability analysis and neural network verification tools, which help validate that control policies remain within safe operating bounds even in uncertain environments. The paper includes illustrative examples demonstrating the implementation aspects of safe learning frameworks that combine the strengths of data-driven approaches with the rigor of physical principles, offering a path toward the safe control of complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: We present a hardware-integrated security framework for LiFi networks through device fingerprint extraction within the IEEE 802.15.7 protocol. Our Optic Fingerprint (OFP) model utilizes inherent LED nonlinearities to generate amplitude-based feature vectors in time and frequency domains, specifically designed for optical wireless systems. Experimental results with 39 commercial LEDs demonstrate 90.36% classification accuracy across SNR 10-30 dB while maintaining standard compliance, offering a practical physical-layer authentication solution for visible light communication.

Title: Simultaneous Polysomnography and Cardiotocography Reveal Temporal Correlation Between Maternal Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Fetal Hypoxia
Authors: Jingyu Wang, Donglin Xie, Jingying Ma, Yunliang Sun, Linyan Zhang, Rui Bai, Zelin Tu, Liyue Xu, Jun Wei, Jingjing Yang, Yanan Liu, Huijie Yi, Bing Zhou, Long Zhao, Xueli Zhang, Mengling Feng, Xiaosong Dong, Guoli Liu, Fang Han, Shenda Hong
Abstract: Background: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) during pregnancy is common and can negatively affect fetal outcomes. However, studies on the immediate effects of maternal hypoxia on fetal heart rate (FHR) changes are lacking. Methods: We used time-synchronized polysomnography (PSG) and cardiotocography (CTG) data from two cohorts to analyze the correlation between maternal hypoxia and FHR changes (accelerations or decelerations). Maternal hypoxic event characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear modeling (GLM) to assess their associations with different FHR changes. Results: A total of 118 pregnant women participated. FHR changes were significantly associated with maternal hypoxia, primarily characterized by accelerations. A longer hypoxic duration correlated with more significant FHR accelerations (P < 0.05), while prolonged hypoxia and greater SpO2 drop were linked to FHR decelerations (P < 0.05). Both cohorts showed a transient increase in FHR during maternal hypoxia, which returned to baseline after the event resolved. Conclusion: Maternal hypoxia significantly affects FHR, suggesting that maternal OSAS may contribute to fetal hypoxia. These findings highlight the importance of maternal-fetal interactions and provide insights for future interventions.

Title: ORIS allocation to minimize the outage probability in a multi-user VLC scenario
Authors: Borja Genoves Guzman, Maïté Brandt-Pearce
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a promising solution to address the growing demand for wireless data, leveraging the widespread use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as transmitters. However, its deployment is challenged by link blockages that cause connectivity outages. Optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have recently emerged as a solution to mitigate these disruptions. This work considers a multi-user VLC system and investigates the optimal association of ORISs to LEDs and users to minimize the outage probability while limiting the number of ORISs used. Numerical results from our proposed optimization algorithm demonstrate that using ORISs can reduce the outage probability by up to 85% compared to a no-ORIS scenario.

Title: Towards Cardiac MRI Foundation Models: Comprehensive Visual-Tabular Representations for Whole-Heart Assessment and Beyond
Authors: Yundi Zhang, Paul Hager, Che Liu, Suprosanna Shit, Chen Chen, Daniel Rueckert, Jiazhen Pan
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive cardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy and physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic, and lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and disease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand cardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an individual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly exploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have begun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data and focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a comprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a comprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of individual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants, ViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling a complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with detailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This multi-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including cardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and classification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified framework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging features and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific models toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health, highlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in cardiac analysis.

Title: Adaptive Task Space Non-Singular Terminal Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control of a 7-DOF Robotic Manipulator
Authors: L. Wan (1), S. Smith (1 and 2), Y.-J. Pan (1), E. Witrant (1 and 2) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, (2) GIPSA-lab CNRS, University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France)
Abstract: This paper presents a new task-space Non-singular Terminal Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (NT-STSM) controller with adaptive gains for robust trajectory tracking of a 7-DOF robotic manipulator. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking, making it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A rigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for practical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external disturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking with reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other NT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the proposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex motions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and various industrial applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a review for the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Short-form UGC Video Quality Assessment and Enhancement. The challenge comprises two tracks: (i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of lightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an emphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and other computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA competitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for single image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800 synthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images, which are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of 8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that benefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and TikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final submissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the progress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution. The project is publicly available at this https URL ChallengeCVPR-NTIRE2025.

Title: GOAT-TTS: LLM-based Text-To-Speech Generation Optimized via A Dual-Branch Architecture
Authors: Yaodong Song, Hongjie Chen, Jie Lian, Yuxin Zhang, Guangmin Xia, Zehan Li, Genliang Zhao, Jian Kang, Yongxiang Li, Jie Li
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.

Title: Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Digital Pathology: Achieving Foundation Model Performance with Minimal Clinical Data
Authors: Ekaterina Redekop, Mara Pleasure, Vedrana Ivezic, Zichen Wang, Kimberly Flores, Anthony Sisk, William Speier, Corey Arnold
Abstract: Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.

Title: Learning-based Delay Compensation for Enhanced Control of Assistive Soft Robots
Authors: Adrià Mompó Alepuz, Dimitrios Papageorgiou, Silvia Tolu
Abstract: Soft robots are increasingly used in healthcare, especially for assistive care, due to their inherent safety and adaptability. Controlling soft robots is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics and the presence of time delays, especially in applications like a soft robotic arm for patient care. This paper presents a learning-based approach to approximate the nonlinear state predictor (Smith Predictor), aiming to improve tracking performance in a two-module soft robot arm with a short inherent input delay. The method uses Kernel Recursive Least Squares Tracker (KRLST) for online learning of the system dynamics and a Legendre Delay Network (LDN) to compress past input history for efficient delay compensation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in tracking performance compared to a baseline model-based non-linear controller. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of the improvements. The method is computationally efficient and adaptable online, making it suitable for real-world scenarios and highlighting its potential for enabling safer and more accurate control of soft robots in assistive care applications.

Title: Learning Transferable Friction Models and LuGre Identification via Physics Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Asutay Ozmen, João P. Hespanha, Katie Byl
Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially, we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks, offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap in robotics and control.

Title: Practical Insights on Grasp Strategies for Mobile Manipulation in the Wild
Authors: Isabella Huang, Richard Cheng, Sangwoon Kim, Dan Kruse, Carolyn Matl, Lukas Kaul, JC Hancock, Shanmuga Harikumar, Mark Tjersland, James Borders, Dan Helmick
Abstract: Mobile manipulation robots are continuously advancing, with their grasping capabilities rapidly progressing. However, there are still significant gaps preventing state-of-the-art mobile manipulators from widespread real-world deployments, including their ability to reliably grasp items in unstructured environments. To help bridge this gap, we developed SHOPPER, a mobile manipulation robot platform designed to push the boundaries of reliable and generalizable grasp strategies. We develop these grasp strategies and deploy them in a real-world grocery store -- an exceptionally challenging setting chosen for its vast diversity of manipulable items, fixtures, and layouts. In this work, we present our detailed approach to designing general grasp strategies towards picking any item in a real grocery store. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of our latest real-world field test, discussing key findings related to fundamental failure modes over hundreds of distinct pick attempts. Through our detailed analysis, we aim to offer valuable practical insights and identify key grasping challenges, which can guide the robotics community towards pressing open problems in the field.

Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease remains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and outcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the automated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such algorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment response assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice. Therefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations methods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on high quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to address this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater variability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets from four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being recorded on video (two instances doing "from scratch" and two instances after AI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for testing phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the completion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release the 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established pipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists checking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its previous edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these high-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test benchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain metastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI images obtained from patients with brain metastases.

Title: Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Parking
Authors: Farhad Nawaz, Minjun Sung, Darshan Gadginmath, Jovin D'sa, Sangjae Bae, David Isele, Nadia Figueroa, Nikolai Matni, Faizan M. Tariq
Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking situations.

Abstract: This paper reviews the NTIRE 2025 Challenge on Day and Night Raindrop Removal for Dual-Focused Images. This challenge received a wide range of impressive solutions, which are developed and evaluated using our collected real-world Raindrop Clarity dataset. Unlike existing deraining datasets, our Raindrop Clarity dataset is more diverse and challenging in degradation types and contents, which includes day raindrop-focused, day background-focused, night raindrop-focused, and night background-focused degradations. This dataset is divided into three subsets for competition: 14,139 images for training, 240 images for validation, and 731 images for testing. The primary objective of this challenge is to establish a new and powerful benchmark for the task of removing raindrops under varying lighting and focus conditions. There are a total of 361 participants in the competition, and 32 teams submitting valid solutions and fact sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Raindrop Clarity dataset. The project can be found at this https URL.

Title: TimeCapsule: Solving the Jigsaw Puzzle of Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Compressed Predictive Representations
Authors: Yihang Lu, Yangyang Xu, Qitao Qing, Xianwei Meng
Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Biasing the Driving Style of an Artificial Race Driver for Online Time-Optimal Maneuver Planning
Authors: Sebastiano Taddei, Mattia Piccinini, Francesco Biral
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to bias the driving style of an artificial race driver (ARD) for online time-optimal trajectory planning. Our method leverages a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that combines time minimization with exit speed maximization at the end of the planning horizon. We introduce a new MPC terminal cost formulation based on the trajectory planned in the previous MPC step, enabling ARD to adapt its driving style from early to late apex maneuvers in real-time. Our approach is computationally efficient, allowing for low replan times and long planning horizons. We validate our method through simulations, comparing the results against offline minimum-lap-time (MLT) optimal control and online minimum-time MPC solutions. The results demonstrate that our new terminal cost enables ARD to bias its driving style, and achieve online lap times close to the MLT solution and faster than the minimum-time MPC solution. Our approach paves the way for a better understanding of the reasons behind human drivers' choice of early or late apex maneuvers.

Title: A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data
Authors: Sifei Li, Mining Tan, Feier Shen, Minyan Luo, Zijiao Yin, Fan Tang, Weiming Dong, Changsheng Xu
Abstract: Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.

Title: Integral control of the proximal gradient method for unbiased sparse optimization
Authors: V. Cerone, S. M. Fosson, A. Re, D. Regruto
Abstract: Proximal gradient methods are popular in sparse optimization as they are straightforward to implement. Nevertheless, they achieve biased solutions, requiring many iterations to converge. This work addresses these issues through a suitable feedback control of the algorithm's hyperparameter. Specifically, by designing an integral control that does not substantially impact the computational complexity, we can reach an unbiased solution in a reasonable number of iterations. In the paper, we develop and analyze the convergence of the proposed approach for strongly-convex problems. Moreover, numerical simulations validate and extend the theoretical results to the non-strongly convex framework.

Title: Can Masked Autoencoders Also Listen to Birds?
Authors: Lukas Rauch, Ilyass Moummad, René Heinrich, Alexis Joly, Bernhard Sick, Christoph Scholz
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet fail to capture the fine-grained acoustic characteristics of specialized domains such as bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification is critical for assessing environmental health, yet general-purpose models inadequately address its unique acoustic challenges. To address this, we introduce Bird-MAE, a domain-specialized MAE pretrained on the large-scale BirdSet dataset. We explore adjustments to pretraining, fine-tuning and utilizing frozen representations. Bird-MAE achieves state-of-the-art results across all BirdSet downstream tasks, substantially improving multi-label classification performance compared to the general-purpose Audio-MAE baseline. Additionally, we propose prototypical probing, a parameter-efficient method for leveraging MAEs' frozen representations. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37\% in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately 3\% on average on BirdSet.

Title: Optimizing Movable Antennas in Wideband Multi-User MIMO With Hardware Impairments
Authors: Amna Irshad, Emil Björnson, Alva Kosasih, Vitaly Petrov
Abstract: Movable antennas represent an emerging field in telecommunication research and a potential approach to achieving higher data rates in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications when the total number of antennas is limited. Most solutions and analyses to date have been limited to \emph{narrowband} setups. This work complements the prior studies by quantifying the benefit of using movable antennas in \emph{wideband} MIMO communication systems. First, we derive a novel uplink wideband system model that also accounts for distortion from transceiver hardware impairments. We then formulate and solve an optimization task to maximize the average sum rate by adjusting the antenna positions using particle swarm optimization. Finally, the performance with movable antennas is compared with fixed uniform arrays and the derived theoretical upper bound. The numerical study concludes that the data rate improvement from movable antennas over other arrays heavily depends on the level of hardware impairments, the richness of the multi-path environments, and the number of subcarriers. The present study provides vital insights into the most suitable use cases for movable antennas in future wideband systems.

Title: Efficient Chebyshev Reconstruction for the Anisotropic Equilibrium Model in Magnetic Particle Imaging
Authors: Christine Droigk, Daniel Hernández Durán, Marco Maass, Tobias Knopp, Konrad Scheffler
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.

Title: Degrees of Freedom of Holographic MIMO -- Fundamental Theory and Analytical Methods
Authors: Juan Carlos Ruiz-Sicilia, Marco Di Renzo, Placido Mursia, Vincenzo Sciancalepore, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is envisioned as one of the most promising technology enablers for future sixth-generation (6G) networks. The use of electrically large holographic surface (HoloS) antennas has the potential to significantly boost the spatial multiplexing gain by increasing the number of degrees of freedom (DoF), even in line-of-sight (LoS) channels. In this context, the research community has shown a growing interest in characterizing the fundamental limits of this technology. In this paper, we compare the two analytical methods commonly utilized in the literature for this purpose: the cut-set integral and the self-adjoint operator. We provide a detailed description of both methods and discuss their advantages and limitations.

Title: Imperative MPC: An End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning with Differentiable MPC for UAV Attitude Control
Authors: Haonan He, Yuheng Qiu, Junyi Geng
Abstract: Modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics are critical in robotics, especially in scenarios with unpredictable external influences and complex dynamics. Traditional cascaded modular control pipelines often yield suboptimal performance due to conservative assumptions and tedious parameter tuning. Pure data-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample efficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid methods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an end-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a self-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry (IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and predicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in a bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control actions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and predicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based perception with the interpretable model-based control. Results show the effectiveness even under strong wind. It can simultaneously enhance both the MPC parameter learning and IMU prediction performance.

Title: A Multi-task Learning Balanced Attention Convolutional Neural Network Model for Few-shot Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition
Authors: Wei Huang, Shumeng Sun, Junpeng Lu, Zhenpeng Xu, Zhengyang Xiu, Hao Zhang
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is of great significance for the protection of marine diversity and national defense security. The development of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces challenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex environmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task balanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The method integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning strategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to jointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks. The channel attention mechanism dynamically enhances discriminative acoustic features such as harmonic structures while suppressing noise. Experiments on the Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\% classification accuracy and 95\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular state-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic benefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic weighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions. This work provides an efficient solution for few-shot underwater acoustic recognition, advancing research in marine bioacoustics and sonar signal processing.

Title: A New Semidefinite Relaxation for Linear and Piecewise-Affine Optimal Control with Time Scaling
Authors: Lujie Yang, Tobia Marcucci, Pablo A. Parrilo, Russ Tedrake
Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation for optimal control of linear systems with time scaling. These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program.

Title: MCANet: Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-Scale Cross-Axis Attention
Authors: Hao Shao, Quansheng Zeng, Qibin Hou, Jufeng Yang
Abstract: Efficiently capturing multi-scale information and building long-range dependencies among pixels are essential for medical image segmentation because of the various sizes and shapes of the lesion regions or organs. In this paper, we present Multi-scale Cross-axis Attention (MCA) to solve the above challenging issues based on the efficient axial attention. Instead of simply connecting axial attention along the horizontal and vertical directions sequentially, we propose to calculate dual cross attentions between two parallel axial attentions to capture global information better. To process the significant variations of lesion regions or organs in individual sizes and shapes, we also use multiple convolutions of strip-shape kernels with different kernel sizes in each axial attention path to improve the efficiency of the proposed MCA in encoding spatial information. We build the proposed MCA upon the MSCAN backbone, yielding our network, termed MCANet. Our MCANet with only 4M+ parameters performs even better than most previous works with heavy backbones (e.g., Swin Transformer) on four challenging tasks, including skin lesion segmentation, nuclei segmentation, abdominal multi-organ segmentation, and polyp segmentation.

Title: Dynamic Electromagnetic Navigation
Authors: Jasan Zughaibi, Bradley J. Nelson, Michael Muehlebach
Abstract: Magnetic navigation offers wireless control over magnetic objects, which has important medical applications, such as targeted drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery. Magnetic navigation systems are categorized into systems using permanent magnets and systems based on electromagnets. Electromagnetic Navigation Systems (eMNSs) are believed to have a superior actuation bandwidth, facilitating trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. This greatly expands the range of potential medical applications and includes even dynamic environments as encountered in cardiovascular interventions. To showcase the dynamic capabilities of eMNSs, we successfully stabilize a (non-magnetic) inverted pendulum on the tip of a magnetically driven arm. Our approach employs a model-based framework that leverages Lagrangian mechanics to capture the interaction between the mechanical dynamics and the magnetic field. Using system identification, we estimate unknown parameters, the actuation bandwidth, and characterize the system's nonlinearity. To explore the limits of electromagnetic navigation and evaluate its scalability, we characterize the electrical system dynamics and perform reference measurements on a clinical-scale eMNS, affirming that the proposed dynamic control methodologies effectively translate to larger coil configurations. A state-feedback controller stabilizes the inherently unstable pendulum, and an iterative learning control scheme enables accurate tracking of non-equilibrium trajectories. Furthermore, to understand structural limitations of our control strategy, we analyze the influence of magnetic field gradients on the motion of the system. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum through electromagnetic navigation.

Title: Robust Data-Driven Tube-Based Zonotopic Predictive Control with Closed-Loop Guarantees
Authors: Mahsa Farjadnia, Angela Fontan, Amr Alanwar, Marco Molinari, Karl Henrik Johansson
Abstract: This work proposes a robust data-driven tube-based zonotopic predictive control (TZPC) approach for discrete-time linear systems, designed to ensure stability and recursive feasibility in the presence of bounded noise. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In an initial learning phase, we provide an over-approximation of all models consistent with past input and noisy state data using zonotope properties. Subsequently, in a control phase, we formulate an optimization problem, which by integrating terminal ingredients is proven to be recursively feasible. Moreover, we prove that implementing this data-driven predictive control approach guarantees robust exponential stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and competitive performance of the proposed control strategy, compared to recent data-driven predictive control methods, are illustrated through numerical simulations.

Title: Effect of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels on low-voltage feeders: Evidence from smart meter profiles
Authors: T. Becker, R. Smet, B. Macharis, K. Vanthournout
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and solar panels are low-carbon technologies (LCTs) that are being connected to the low-voltage grid (LVG) at a rapid pace. One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the distribution system operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modelled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.

Title: A Framework for Holistic KLD-based Waveform Design for Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC Systems
Authors: Yousef Kloob, Mohammad Al-Jarrah, Emad Alsusa
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at designing integrated waveforms for robust integrated sensing and communication systems. The system model consists of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments and detects multiple targets using a shared-antenna deployment scenario. By leveraging Kullback-Leibler divergence to holistically characterise both communication and sensing subsystems, three optimisation problems are formulated: (i) radar waveform KLD maximisation under communication constraints, (ii) communication waveform KLD maximisation subject to radar KLD requirements, and (iii) an integrated waveform KLD-based optimisation for ISAC that jointly balances both subsystems. The first two problems are solved using a projected gradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a gradient assisted interior point method for the communication waveforms. The third, integrated waveform optimisation approach adopts an alternating direction method of multipliers framework to unify radar and communication waveform designs into a single integrated optimisation, thereby strengthening the trade-off between sensing and communication objectives and achieving higher overall performance than the individual radar- or communication-only techniques. Unlike most existing ISAC waveform designs that regard communication signals solely as interference for sensing, the proposed framework utilises the holistic ISAC waveform-that is, the superimposed communication and sensing signals to boost detection performance in the radar subsystem. Simulation results show significant improvements in both radar detection and communication reliability compared with conventional zero-forcing beamforming and identity covariance radar baselines, demonstrating the promise of KLD-based waveform designs for next-generation ISAC networks.

Title: Predicting and Publishing Accurate Imbalance Prices Using Monte Carlo Tree Search
Authors: Fabio Pavirani, Jonas Van Gompel, Seyed Soroush Karimi Madahi, Bert Claessens, Chris Develder
Abstract: The growing reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has introduced challenges due to their uncontrollable production. This complicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some transmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs that penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit demand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges limit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only calculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk due to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent volatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although transmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the system imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to obtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price estimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially affecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that publishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response actions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network forecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement learning agents. Compared to Belgium's current publication method, our technique improves price accuracy by 20.4% under ideal conditions and by 12.8% in more realistic scenarios. This research addresses an unexplored, yet crucial problem, positioning this paper as a pioneering work in analyzing the potential of more advanced imbalance price publishing techniques.

Title: Balancing Passenger Transport and Power Distribution: A Distributed Dispatch Policy for Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles
Authors: Jake Robbennolt, Meiyi Li, Javad Mohammadi, Stephen D. Boyles
Abstract: Shared autonomous electric vehicles can provide on-demand transportation for passengers while also interacting extensively with the electric distribution system. This interaction is especially beneficial after a disaster when the large battery capacity of the fleet can be used to restore critical electric loads. We develop a dispatch policy that balances the need to continue serving passengers (especially critical workers) and the ability to transfer energy across the network. The model predictive control policy tracks both passenger and energy flows and provides maximum passenger throughput if any policy can. The resulting mixed integer linear programming problem is difficult to solve for large-scale problems, so a distributed solution approach is developed to improve scalability, privacy, and resilience. We demonstrate that the proposed heuristic, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, is effective in achieving near-optimal solutions quickly. The dispatch policy is examined in simulation to demonstrate the ability of vehicles to balance these competing objectives with benefits to both systems. Finally, we compare several dispatch behaviors, demonstrating the importance of including operational constraints and objectives from both the transportation and electric systems in the model.

Title: Reconfigurable Holographic Surface-aided Distributed MIMO Radar Systems
Authors: Qian Li, Ziang Yang, Dou Li, Hongliang Zhang
Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.

Title: AI and Deep Learning for THz Ultra-Massive MIMO: From Model-Driven Approaches to Foundation Models
Authors: Wentao Yu, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Linglong Dai, Lizhong Zheng, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address challenges in terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (THz UM-MIMO) systems. We identify three key challenges for transceiver design: "hard to compute," "hard to model," and "hard to measure," and argue that AI can provide promising solutions. We propose three research roadmaps for AI algorithms tailored to THz UM-MIMO systems. The first, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes leveraging domain knowledge and using AI to enhance bottleneck modules in established signal processing or optimization frameworks. We discuss four steps: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel station information (CSI) foundation models to unify transceiver module design by focusing on the wireless channel. We propose a compact foundation model to estimate wireless channel score functions, serving as a prior for designing transceiver modules. We outline four steps: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, and joint design of CSI models and model-driven DL. The third roadmap explores applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to THz UM-MIMO systems, with applications in estimation, optimization, searching, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, we discuss open problems and future research directions.

Title: Beamforming Design for Secure RIS-Enabled ISAC: Passive RIS vs. Active RIS
Authors: Vaibhav Kumar, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) communications standard is anticipated to provide integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a fundamental service. These ISAC systems present unique security challenges because of the exposure of information-bearing signals to sensing targets, enabling them to potentially eavesdrop on sensitive communication information with the assistance of sophisticated receivers. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown promising results in enhancing the physical layer security of various wireless communication systems, including ISAC. However, the performance of conventional passive RIS (pRIS)-enabled systems are often limited due to multiplicative fading, which can be alleviated using active RIS (aIRS). In this paper, we consider the problem of beampattern gain maximization in a secure pRIS/aRIS-enabled ISAC system, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints at communication receivers, and information leakage constraints at an eavesdropping target. For the challenging non-convex problem of joint beamforming design at the base station and the pRIS/aRIS, we propose a novel successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method. Unlike the conventional alternating optimization (AO)-based methods, in the proposed SCA-based approach, all of the optimization variables are updated simultaneously in each iteration. The proposed method shows significant performance superiority for pRIS-aided ISAC system compared to a benchmark scheme using penalty-based AO method. Moreover, our simulation results also confirm that aRIS-aided system has a notably higher beampattern gain at the target compared to that offered by the pRIS-aided system for the same power budget. We also present a detailed complexity analysis and proof of convergence for the proposed SCA-based method.

Title: C2GM: Cascading conditional generative cartography framework for multi-scale tile map generation with geographic feature constraints
Authors: Chenxing Sun, Yongyang Xu, Xuwei Xu, Xixi Fan, Jing Bai, Xiechun Lu, Zhanlong Chen
Abstract: Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.

Title: Machine learning-based hybrid dynamic modeling and economic predictive control of carbon capture process for ship decarbonization
Authors: Xuewen Zhang, Kuniadi Wandy Huang, Dat-Nguyen Vo, Minghao Han, Benjamin Decardi-Nelson, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: Implementing carbon capture technology on-board ships holds promise as a solution to facilitate the reduction of carbon intensity in international shipping, as mandated by the International Maritime Organization. In this work, we address the energy-efficient operation of shipboard carbon capture processes by proposing a hybrid modeling-based economic predictive control scheme. Specifically, we consider a comprehensive shipboard carbon capture process that encompasses the ship engine system and the shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plant. To accurately and robustly characterize the dynamic behaviors of this shipboard plant, we develop a hybrid dynamic process model that integrates available imperfect physical knowledge with neural networks trained using process operation data. An economic model predictive control approach is proposed based on the hybrid model to ensure carbon capture efficiency while minimizing energy consumption required for the carbon capture process operation. The cross-entropy method is employed to efficiently solve the complex non-convex optimization problem associated with the proposed hybrid model-based economic model predictive control method. Extensive simulations, analyses, and comparisons are conducted to verify the effectiveness and illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework.

Title: Principles and Framework for the Operationalisation of Meaningful Human Control over Autonomous Systems
Authors: Simeon C. Calvert
Abstract: This paper proposes an alignment for the operationalisation of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) for autonomous systems by proposing operational principles for MHC and introducing a generic framework for its application. With a plethora of different seemingly diverging expansions for use of MHC in practice, this work aims to bring alignment and convergence use in practice. The increasing integration of autonomous systems in various domains emphasises a critical need to maintain human control to ensure responsible safety, accountability, and ethical operation of these systems. The concept of MHC offers an ideal concept for the design and evaluation of human control over autonomous systems, while considering human and technology capabilities. Through analysis of existing literature and investigation across various domains and related concepts, principles for the operationalisation of MHC are set out to provide tangible guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to implement MHC in their systems. The proposed framework dissects generic components of systems and their subsystems aligned with different agents, stakeholders and processes at different levels of proximity to an autonomous technology. The framework is domain-agnostic, emphasizing the universal applicability of the MHC principles irrespective of the technological context, paving the way for safer and more responsible autonomous systems.

Title: A Demo of Radar Sensing Aided Rotatable Antenna for Wireless Communication System
Authors: Qi Dai, Beixiong Zheng, Qiyao Wang, Xue Xiong, Xiaodan Shao, Lipeng Zhu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) represents a novel antenna architecture that enhances wireless communication system performance by independently or collectively adjusting each antenna's boresight/orientation. In this demonstration, we develop a prototype of radar sensing-aided rotatable antenna that integrates radar sensing with dynamic antenna orientation to enhance wireless communication performance while maintaining low hardware costs. The proposed prototype consists of a transmitter (TX) module and a receiver (RX) module, both of which employ universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for transmitting and receiving signals. Specifically, the TX utilizes a laser radar to detect the RX's location and conveys the angle of arrival (AoA) information to its antenna servo, which enables the RA to align its boresight direction with the identified RX. Experimental results examine the effectiveness of the proposed prototype and indicate that the RA significantly outperforms the traditional fixed-antenna system in terms of increasing received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Title: RGB-Phase Speckle: Cross-Scene Stereo 3D Reconstruction via Wrapped Pre-Normalization
Authors: Kai Yang, Zijian Bai, Yang Xiao, Xinyu Li, Xiaohan Shi
Abstract: 3D reconstruction garners increasing attention alongside the advancement of high-level image applications, where dense stereo matching (DSM) serves as a pivotal technique. Previous studies often rely on publicly available datasets for training, focusing on modifying network architectures or incorporating specialized modules to extract domain-invariant features and thus improve model robustness. In contrast, inspired by single-frame structured-light phase-shifting encoding, this study introduces RGB-Speckle, a cross-scene 3D reconstruction framework based on an active stereo camera system, designed to enhance robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding method: first, we randomly perturb phase-shift maps and embed them into the three RGB channels to generate color speckle patterns; subsequently, the camera captures phase-encoded images modulated by objects as input to a stereo matching network. This technique effectively mitigates external interference and ensures consistent input data for RGB-Speckle, thereby bolstering cross-domain 3D reconstruction stability. To validate the proposed method, we conduct complex experiments: (1) construct a color speckle dataset for complex scenarios based on the proposed encoding scheme; (2) evaluate the impact of the phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding technique on 3D reconstruction accuracy; and (3) further investigate its robustness across diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RGB-Speckle model offers significant advantages in cross-domain and cross-scene 3D reconstruction tasks, enhancing model generalization and reinforcing robustness in challenging environments, thus providing a novel solution for robust 3D reconstruction research.

Title: A New Statistical Approach to Calibration-Free Localization Using Unlabeled Crowdsourced Data
Authors: Haozhou Hu, Harpreet S. Dhillon, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: Fingerprinting-based indoor localization methods typically require labor-intensive site surveys to collect signal measurements at known reference locations and frequent recalibration, which limits their scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel approach for indoor localization that utilizes crowdsourced data without location labels. We leverage the statistical information of crowdsourced data and propose a cumulative distribution function (CDF) based distance estimation method that maps received signal strength (RSS) to distances from access points. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional distance estimation based on the empirical path loss model by efficiently capturing the impacts of shadow fading and multipath. Compared to fingerprinting, our unsupervised statistical approach eliminates the need for signal measurements at known reference locations. The estimated distances are then integrated into a three-step framework to determine the target location. The localization performance of our proposed method is evaluated using RSS data generated from ray-tracing simulations. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in localization accuracy compared to methods based on the empirical path loss model. Furthermore, our statistical approach, which relies on unlabeled data, achieves localization accuracy comparable to that of the supervised approach, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) algorithm, which requires fingerprints with location labels. For reproducibility and future research, we make the ray-tracing dataset publicly available at [2].

Title: Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization
Authors: Shreya Khisa, Ali Amhaz, Mohamed Elhattab, Chadi Assi, Sanaa Sharafeddine
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.

Title: Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints
Authors: Xiaodong Shao, Haoyang Yang, Haoran Li, Zongyu Zuo, Jose Guadalupe Romero, Qinglei Hu
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability criterion. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.

Title: SIFT-50M: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning
Authors: Prabhat Pandey, Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan, K V Vijay Girish, Arunasish Sen, Jian Xie, Grant P. Strimel, Andreas Schwarz
Abstract: We introduce SIFT (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), a 50M-example dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of speech-text large language models (LLMs). SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs.

Title: Learning spatial hearing via innate mechanisms
Authors: Yang Chu, Wayne Luk, Dan Goodman
Abstract: The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change during and after development. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate the auditory spatial map throughout our lifetimes. This is often thought of as a "supervised" learning process where a "teacher" (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your map. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range spatial auditory map. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signal. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial maps.

Title: Unified Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Gaochang Wu, Jing Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyou Chai
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with Learning-Based Perception
Authors: Zhiting Mei, Anushri Dixit, Meghan Booker, Emily Zhou, Mariko Storey-Matsutani, Allen Z. Ren, Ola Shorinwa, Anirudha Majumdar
Abstract: Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to be used out of the box for transforming high-dimensional, noisy, and partial observations of the world into rich occupancy representations. However, the reliability of these models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when deployed in environments unseen during training. To provide safety guarantees, we rigorously quantify the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for object detection and scene completion via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction. Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states when perception outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously unseen indoor, static environments. These experiments validate the safety assurances for obstacle avoidance provided by PwC. In simulation, our method reduces obstacle misdetection by $70\%$ compared to uncalibrated perception models. While misdetections lead to collisions for baseline methods, our approach consistently achieves $100\%$ safety. We further demonstrate reducing the conservatism of our method without sacrificing safety, achieving a $46\%$ increase in success rates in challenging environments while maintaining $100\%$ safety. In hardware experiments, our method improves empirical safety by $40\%$ over baselines and reduces obstacle misdetection by $93.3\%$. The safety gap widens to $46.7\%$ when navigation speed increases, highlighting our approach's robustness under more demanding conditions.

Title: What Are the Odds? Improving the foundations of Statistical Model Checking
Authors: Tobias Meggendorfer, Maximilian Weininger, Patrick Wienhöft
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model for decision making under uncertainty. They exhibit non-deterministic choice as well as probabilistic uncertainty. Traditionally, verification algorithms assume exact knowledge of the probabilities that govern the behaviour of an MDP. As this assumption is often unrealistic in practice, statistical model checking (SMC) was developed in the past two decades. It allows to analyse MDPs with unknown transition probabilities and provide probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the result. Model-based SMC algorithms sample the MDP and build a model of it by estimating all transition probabilities, essentially for every transition answering the question: ``What are the odds?'' However, so far the statistical methods employed by the state of the art SMC algorithms are quite naive. Our contribution are several fundamental improvements to those methods: On the one hand, we survey statistics literature for better concentration inequalities; on the other hand, we propose specialised approaches that exploit our knowledge of the MDP. Our improvements are generally applicable to many kinds of problem statements because they are largely independent of the setting. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that they lead to significant gains, reducing the number of samples that the SMC algorithm has to collect by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: We introduce a data-adaptive inversion method that integrates classical or deep learning-based approaches with iterative graph Laplacian regularization, specifically targeting acoustic impedance inversion - a critical task in seismic exploration. Our method initiates from an impedance estimate derived using either traditional inversion techniques or neural network-based methods. This initial estimate guides the construction of a graph Laplacian operator, effectively capturing structural characteristics of the impedance profile. Utilizing a Tikhonov-inspired variational framework with this graph-informed prior, our approach iteratively updates and refines the impedance estimate while continuously recalibrating the graph Laplacian. This iterative refinement shows rapid convergence, increased accuracy, and enhanced robustness to noise compared to initial reconstructions alone. Extensive validation performed on synthetic and real seismic datasets across varying noise levels confirms the effectiveness of our method. Performance evaluations include four initial inversion methods: two classical techniques and two neural networks - previously established in the literature.

Title: A Coding-Theoretic Analysis of Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning Geometry
Authors: Martin Lindström, Borja Rodríguez-Gálvez, Ragnar Thobaben, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.

Title: Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation
Authors: Barbara Pascal, Samuel Vaiter
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number demonstrating its ability to yield very consistent estimates.

Title: Presto! Distilling Steps and Layers for Accelerating Music Generation
Authors: Zachary Novack, Ge Zhu, Jonah Casebeer, Julian McAuley, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Nicholas J. Bryan
Abstract: Despite advances in diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) methods, efficient, high-quality generation remains a challenge. We introduce Presto!, an approach to inference acceleration for score-based diffusion transformers via reducing both sampling steps and cost per step. To reduce steps, we develop a new score-based distribution matching distillation (DMD) method for the EDM-family of diffusion models, the first GAN-based distillation method for TTM. To reduce the cost per step, we develop a simple, but powerful improvement to a recent layer distillation method that improves learning via better preserving hidden state variance. Finally, we combine our step and layer distillation methods together for a dual-faceted approach. We evaluate our step and layer distillation methods independently and show each yield best-in-class performance. Our combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs with improved diversity, accelerating our base model by 10-18x (230/435ms latency for 32 second mono/stereo 44.1kHz, 15x faster than comparable SOTA) -- the fastest high-quality TTM to our knowledge.

Title: EmoSphere++: Emotion-Controllable Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech via Emotion-Adaptive Spherical Vector
Authors: Deok-Hyeon Cho, Hyung-Seok Oh, Seung-Bin Kim, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved significant progress in recent years; however, challenges remain owing to the inherent complexity of emotions and limitations of the available emotional speech datasets and models. Previous studies typically relied on limited emotional speech datasets or required extensive manual annotations, restricting their ability to generalize across different speakers and emotional styles. In this paper, we present EmoSphere++, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS model that can control emotional style and intensity to resemble natural human speech. We introduce a novel emotion-adaptive spherical vector that models emotional style and intensity without human annotation. Moreover, we propose a multi-level style encoder that can ensure effective generalization for both seen and unseen speakers. We also introduce additional loss functions to enhance the emotion transfer performance for zero-shot scenarios. We employ a conditional flow matching-based decoder to achieve high-quality and expressive emotional TTS in a few sampling steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Title: CDXLSTM: Boosting Remote Sensing Change Detection with Extended Long Short-Term Memory
Authors: Zhenkai Wu, Xiaowen Ma, Rongrong Lian, Kai Zheng, Wei Zhang
Abstract: In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers are computationally expensive, and Mambas face CUDA dependence and local correlation loss. In this paper, we propose CDXLSTM, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Title: AMPS: ASR with Multimodal Paraphrase Supervision
Authors: Abhishek Gupta, Amruta Parulekar, Sameep Chattopadhyay, Preethi Jyothi
Abstract: Spontaneous or conversational multilingual speech presents many challenges for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this work, we present a new technique AMPS that augments a multilingual multimodal ASR system with paraphrase-based supervision for improved conversational ASR in multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, and Nyanja. We use paraphrases of the reference transcriptions as additional supervision while training the multimodal ASR model and selectively invoke this paraphrase objective for utterances with poor ASR performance. Using AMPS with a state-of-the-art multimodal model SeamlessM4T, we obtain significant relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) of up to 5%. We present detailed analyses of our system using both objective and human evaluation metrics.

Title: SemML: Enhancing Automata-Theoretic LTL Synthesis with Machine Learning
Authors: Jan Kretinsky, Tobias Meggendorfer, Maximilian Prokop, Ashkan Zarkhah
Abstract: Synthesizing a reactive system from specifications given in linear temporal logic (LTL) is a classical problem, finding its applications in safety-critical systems design. We present our tool SemML, which won this year's LTL realizability tracks of SYNTCOMP, after years of domination by Strix. While both tools are based on the automata-theoretic approach, ours relies heavily on (i) Semantic labelling, additional information of logical nature, coming from recent LTL-to-automata translations and decorating the resulting parity game, and (ii) Machine Learning approaches turning this information into a guidance oracle for on-the-fly exploration of the parity game (whence the name SemML). Our tool fills the missing gaps of previous suggestions to use such an oracle and provides an efficeint implementation with additional algorithmic improvements. We evaluate SemML both on the entire set of SYNTCOMP as well as a synthetic data set, compare it to Strix, and analyze the advantages and limitations. As SemML solves more instances on SYNTCOMP and does so significantly faster on larger instances, this demonstrates for the first time that machine-learning-aided approaches can out-perform state-of-the-art tools in real LTL synthesis.

Title: A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots
Authors: Shuqing Liu, Rong Su, Karl H.Johansson
Abstract: The pattern formation task is commonly seen in a multi-robot system. In this paper, we study the problem of forming complex shapes with functionally limited mobile robots, which have to rely on other robots to precisely locate themselves. The goal is to decide whether a given shape can be filled by a given set of robots; in case the answer is yes, to complete a shape formation process as fast as possible with a minimum amount of communication. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to form complex shapes beyond the capability of given approaches - the latter calls for a decision procedure that can tell whether a target shape can be formed before the actual shape-forming process starts. In this paper, we develop a method that does not require global coordinate information during the execution process and can effectively decide whether it is feasible to form the desired shape. The latter is achieved via a planning procedure that is capable of handling a variety of complex shapes, in particular, those with holes, and assigning a simple piece of scheduling information to each robot, facilitating subsequent distributed execution, which does not rely on the coordinates of all robots but only those of neighboring ones. The effectiveness of our shape-forming approach is vividly illustrated in several simulation case studies.

Title: Impact of Data Duplication on Deep Neural Network-Based Image Classifiers: Robust vs. Standard Models
Authors: Alireza Aghabagherloo, Aydin Abadi, Sumanta Sarkar, Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Bart Preneel
Abstract: The accuracy and robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks are significantly influenced by factors such as training data quality, model architecture, the training process, and the deployment environment. In recent years, duplicated data in training sets, especially in language models, has attracted considerable attention. It has been shown that deduplication enhances both training performance and model accuracy in language models. While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification. Our analysis indicates that the presence of duplicated images in the training set not only negatively affects the efficiency of model training but also may result in lower accuracy of the image classifier. This negative impact of duplication on accuracy is particularly evident when duplicated data is non-uniform across classes or when duplication, whether uniform or non-uniform, occurs in the training set of an adversarially trained model. Even when duplicated samples are selected in a uniform way, increasing the amount of duplication does not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.

Title: CAFA: a Controllable Automatic Foley Artist
Authors: Roi Benita, Michael Finkelson, Tavi Halperin, Gleb Sterkin, Yossi Adi
Abstract: Foley is a key element in video production, refers to the process of adding an audio signal to a silent video while ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. In recent years, the rise of personalized content creation and advancements in automatic video-to-audio models have increased the demand for greater user control in the process. One possible approach is to incorporate text to guide audio generation. While supported by existing methods, challenges remain in ensuring compatibility between modalities, particularly when the text introduces additional information or contradicts the sounds naturally inferred from the visuals. In this work, we introduce CAFA (Controllable Automatic Foley Artist) a video-and-text-to-audio model that generates semantically and temporally aligned audio for a given video, guided by text input. CAFA is built upon a text-to-audio model and integrates video information through a modality adapter mechanism. By incorporating text, users can refine semantic details and introduce creative variations, guiding the audio synthesis beyond the expected video contextual cues. Experiments show that besides its superior quality in terms of semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization the proposed method enable high textual controllability as demonstrated in subjective and objective evaluations.

Title: Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading
Authors: David Schaurecker, David Wozabal, Nils Löhndorf, Thorsten Staake
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.

Title: Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion
Authors: Minjie Deng, Yan Wei, Hao Zhai, An Wu, Yuncan Ouyang, Qianyao Peng
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:

Title: Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports
Authors: Donggeon David Oh, Justin Lidard, Haimin Hu, Himani Sinhmar, Elle Lazarski, Deepak Gopinath, Emily S. Sumner, Jonathan A. DeCastro, Guy Rosman, Naomi Ehrich Leonard, Jaime Fernández Fisac
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.
