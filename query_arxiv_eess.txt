Title: A Tutorial-cum-Survey on Self-Supervised Learning for Wi-Fi Sensing: Trends, Challenges, and Outlook
Authors: Ahmed Y. Radwan, Mustafa Yildirim, Navid Hasanzadeh, Hina Tabassum, Shahrokh Valaee
Abstract: Wi-Fi technology has evolved from simple communication routers to sensing devices. Wi-Fi sensing leverages conventional Wi-Fi transmissions to extract and analyze channel state information (CSI) for applications like proximity detection, occupancy detection, activity recognition, and health monitoring. By leveraging existing infrastructure, Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving, non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution which, unlike cameras, is not sensitive to lighting conditions. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the Wi-Fi standardization activities, this tutorial-cum-survey first introduces fundamental concepts related to Wi-Fi CSI, outlines the CSI measurement methods, and examines the impact of mobile objects on CSI. The mechanics of a simplified testbed for CSI extraction are also described. Then, we present a qualitative comparison of the existing Wi-Fi sensing datasets, their specifications, and pin-point their shortcomings. Next, a variety of preprocessing techniques are discussed that are beneficial for feature extraction and explainability of machine learning (ML) algorithms. We then provide a qualitative review of recent ML approaches in the domain of Wi-Fi sensing and present the significance of self-supervised learning (SSL) in that context. Specifically, the mechanics of contrastive and non-contrastive learning solutions is elaborated in detail and a quantitative comparative analysis is presented in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting emerging technologies that can be leveraged to enhance the performance of Wi-Fi sensing and opportunities for further research in this domain

Title: CMT-LLM: Contextual Multi-Talker ASR Utilizing Large Language Models
Authors: Jiajun He, Naoki Sawada, Koichi Miyazaki, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: In real-world applications, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems must handle overlapping speech from multiple speakers and recognize rare words like technical terms. Traditional methods address multi-talker ASR and contextual biasing separately, limiting performance in complex scenarios. We propose a unified framework that combines multi-talker overlapping speech recognition and contextual biasing into a single task. Our ASR method integrates pretrained speech encoders and large language models (LLMs), using optimized finetuning strategies. We also introduce a two-stage filtering algorithm to efficiently identify relevant rare words from large biasing lists and incorporate them into the LLM's prompt input, enhancing rare word recognition. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional contextual biasing methods, achieving a WER of 7.9% on LibriMix and 32.9% on AMI SDM when the biasing size is 1,000, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex speech scenarios.

Title: Evaluating Logit-Based GOP Scores for Mispronunciation Detection
Authors: Aditya Kamlesh Parikh, Cristian Tejedor-Garcia, Catia Cucchiarini, Helmer Strik
Abstract: Pronunciation assessment relies on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) scores, traditionally derived from softmax-based posterior probabilities. However, posterior probabilities may suffer from overconfidence and poor phoneme separation, limiting their effectiveness. This study compares logit-based GOP scores with probability-based GOP scores for mispronunciation detection. We conducted our experiment on two L2 English speech datasets spoken by Dutch and Mandarin speakers, assessing classification performance and correlation with human ratings. Logit-based methods outperform probability-based GOP in classification, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics. The maximum logit GOP shows the strongest alignment with human perception, while a combination of different GOP scores balances probability and logit features. The findings suggest that hybrid GOP methods incorporating uncertainty modeling and phoneme-specific weighting improve pronunciation assessment.

Title: Seamless Dysfluent Speech Text Alignment for Disordered Speech Analysis
Authors: Zongli Ye, Jiachen Lian, Xuanru Zhou, Jinming Zhang, Haodong Li, Shuhe Li, Chenxu Guo, Anaisha Das, Peter Park, Zoe Ezzes, Jet Vonk, Brittany Morin, Rian Bogley, Lisa Wauters, Zachary Miller, Maria Gorno-Tempini, Gopala Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Accurate alignment of dysfluent speech with intended text is crucial for automating the diagnosis of neurodegenerative speech disorders. Traditional methods often fail to model phoneme similarities effectively, limiting their performance. In this work, we propose Neural LCS, a novel approach for dysfluent text-text and speech-text alignment. Neural LCS addresses key challenges, including partial alignment and context-aware similarity mapping, by leveraging robust phoneme-level modeling. We evaluate our method on a large-scale simulated dataset, generated using advanced data simulation techniques, and real PPA data. Neural LCS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both alignment accuracy and dysfluent speech segmentation. Our results demonstrate the potential of Neural LCS to enhance automated systems for diagnosing and analyzing speech disorders, offering a more accurate and linguistically grounded solution for dysfluent speech alignment.

Title: C2PO: Coherent Co-packaged Optics using offset-QAM-16 for Beyond PAM-4 Optical I/O
Authors: Dan Sturm, Marzieyh Rezaei, Alana Dee, Sajjad Moazeni
Abstract: Co-packaged optics (CPO) has emerged as a promising solution for achieving the ultra-high bandwidths, shoreline densities, and energy efficiencies required by future GPUs and network switches for AI. Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16). In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.

Title: TCN-DPD: Parameter-Efficient Temporal Convolutional Networks for Wideband Digital Predistortion
Authors: Huanqiang Duan, Manno Versluis, Qinyu Chen, Leo C. N. de Vreede, Chang Gao
Abstract: Digital predistortion (DPD) is essential for mitigating nonlinearity in RF power amplifiers, particularly for wideband applications. This paper presents TCN-DPD, a parameter-efficient architecture based on temporal convolutional networks, integrating noncausal dilated convolutions with optimized activation functions. Evaluated on the OpenDPD framework with the DPA_200MHz dataset, TCN-DPD achieves simulated ACPRs of -51.58/-49.26 dBc (L/R), EVM of -47.52 dB, and NMSE of -44.61 dB with 500 parameters and maintains superior linearization than prior models down to 200 parameters, making it promising for efficient wideband PA linearization.

Title: MRI-CORE: A Foundation Model for Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Authors: Haoyu Dong, Yuwen Chen, Hanxue Gu, Nicholas Konz, Yaqian Chen, Qihang Li, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000 MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only 10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in MRI such as classification of image properties including body location, sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many applications.

Title: Directed Acyclic Graph Convolutional Networks
Authors: Samuel Rey, Hamed Ajorlou, Gonzalo Mateos
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets, and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal processing principles.

Title: The Milieu, Science & Logic of Feedback Control
Authors: Robert R. Bitmead
Abstract: 'The cardinal sin in control is to believe that the plant is given' Karl Astrom. Astrom, a towering figure of control theory and practice and awardee of the 1993 IEEE Medal of Honor for his work on adaptive control, provides this assessment of the obstinate part of realizing a feedback controller. And yet we are exhorted to rely on solely-data-driven methods of control design skipping the modeling and plant identification phases entirely. What is going on? Whom should we trust? How do we reconcile the implied ease (or indeed avoidance) of modeling with the steely focus on robustness of the control and the capacity of feedback to accommodate uncertainty? This paper seeks to investigate this subject with the objective of appreciating not whom to trust but what are the circumstances where the direct paradigm of control design from any lightly qualified data set provides a sensible way forward. Here is a clue: It depends on the confidence of your contentions about the plant system, the detailed data themselves and your appetite for failure. The paper attempts to segue repeatedly between the broad philosophical context and hard engineering examples. To instantiate ideas and add detail to vagaries, we incorporate a number of examples, each validated by their demonstrated commercial and industrial viability and each terminating with ein Blickwinkel or perspective in German. As David Wallace-Wells poses, before investing hundreds of billions of dollars we really ought to ask what is the trillion-dollar problem which might potentially be solved. By sticking to industrially proven technologies, we hope to delineate what works suitably well in practice or was judged worthy of the risk.

Title: ICME 2025 Grand Challenge on Video Super-Resolution for Video Conferencing
Authors: Babak Naderi, Ross Cutler, Juhee Cho, Nabakumar Khongbantabam, Dejan Ivkovic
Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-, bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration. This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor, providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks: general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.

Title: CMI-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Music Instruction Following
Authors: Yinghao Ma, Siyou Li, Juntao Yu, Emmanouil Benetos, Akira Maezawa
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

Title: Similar Formation Control of Multi-Agent Systems over Directed Acyclic Graphs via Matrix-Weighted Laplacian
Authors: Zhipeng Fan, Yujie Xu, Mingyu Fu, Han Sun, Weiqiu Zhang, Heng Zhang
Abstract: This brief proposes a distributed formation control strategy via matrix-weighted Laplacian that can achieve a similar formation in 2-D planar using inter-agent relative displacement measurement. Formation patterns that include translation, rotation, and scaling can be characterized by the null space of the matrix-weighted Laplacian associated with the topological graph. The main contribution of this brief is to extend the similar formation problem of undirected graphs to directed acyclic graphs and provide the necessary algebraic criteria for leader selection. Stability analysis, illustrative examples, and simulation results are provided.

Title: From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks
Authors: Weijie Yuan, Yuanhao Cui, Jiacheng Wang, Fan Liu, Geng Sun, Tao Xiang, Jie Xu, Shi Jin, Dusit Niyato, Sinem Coleri, Sumei Sun, Shiwen Mao, Abbas Jamalipour, Dong In Kim, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.

Title: Adding links wisely: how an influencer seeks for leadership in opinion dynamics?
Authors: Lingfei Wang, Yu Xing, Yuhao Yi, Ming Cao, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of leadership development for an external influencer using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, where the influencer is modeled as a fully stubborn agent and leadership is quantified by social power. The influencer seeks to maximize her social power by strategically adding a limited number of links to regular agents. This optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the absorbing probability to the influencer in an augmented Markov chain. The resulting objective function is both monotone and submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm to compute an approximate solution. To handle large-scale networks efficiently, a random walk sampling over the Markov chain is employed to reduce computational complexity. Analytical characterizations of the solution are provided for both low and high stubbornness of regular agents. Specific network topologies are also examined: for complete graphs with rank-one weight matrices, the problem reduces to a hyperbolic 0-1 programmming problem, which is solvable in polynomial time; for symmetric ring graphs with circulant weight matrices and uniform agent stubbornness, the optimal strategy involves selecting agents that are sufficiently dispersed across the network. Numerical simulations are presented for illustration.

Title: Less Conservative Adaptive Gain-scheduling Control for Continuous-time Systems with Polytopic Uncertainties
Authors: Ariany C. Oliveira, Victor C. S. Campos, Leonardo. A. Mozelli
Abstract: The synthesis of adaptive gain-scheduling controller is discussed for continuous-time linear models characterized by polytopic uncertainties. The proposed approach computes the control law assuming the parameters as uncertain and adaptively provides an estimate for the gain-scheduling implementation. Conservativeness is reduced using our recent results on describing uncertainty: i) a structural relaxation that casts the parameters as outer terms and introduces slack variables; and ii) a precise topological representation that describes the mismatch between the uncertainty and its estimate. Numerical examples illustrate a high degree of relaxation in comparison with the state-of-the-art.

Title: Wasserstein-Barycenter Consensus for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ali Baheri
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demands principled mechanisms to align heterogeneous policies while preserving the capacity for specialized behavior. We introduce a novel consensus framework that defines the team strategy as the entropic-regularized $p$-Wasserstein barycenter of agents' joint state--action visitation measures. By augmenting each agent's policy objective with a soft penalty proportional to its Sinkhorn divergence from this barycenter, the proposed approach encourages coherent group behavior without enforcing rigid parameter sharing. We derive an algorithm that alternates between Sinkhorn-barycenter computation and policy-gradient updates, and we prove that, under standard Lipschitz and compactness assumptions, the maximal pairwise policy discrepancy contracts at a geometric rate. Empirical evaluation on a cooperative navigation case study demonstrates that our OT-barycenter consensus outperforms an independent learners baseline in convergence speed and final coordination success.

Title: Mitigating Non-Target Speaker Bias in Guided Speaker Embedding
Authors: Shota Horiguchi, Takanori Ashihara, Marc Delcroix, Atsushi Ando, Naohiro Tawara
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality speaker embeddings in multi-speaker conditions is crucial for many applications. A recently proposed guided speaker embedding framework, which utilizes speech activities of target and non-target speakers as clues, drastically improved embeddings under severe overlap with small degradation in low-overlap cases. However, since extreme overlaps are rare in natural conversations, this degradation cannot be overlooked. This paper first reveals that the degradation is caused by the global-statistics-based modules, widely used in speaker embedding extractors, being overly sensitive to intervals containing only non-target speakers. As a countermeasure, we propose an extension of such modules that exploit the target speaker activity clues, to compute statistics from intervals where the target is active. The proposed method improves speaker verification performance in both low and high overlap ratios, and diarization performance on multiple datasets.

Title: Constrained Diffusers for Safe Planning and Control
Authors: Jichen Zhang, Liqun Zhao, Antonis Papachristodoulou, Jack Umenberger
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in planning and control tasks due to their ability to represent multimodal distributions over actions and trajectories. However, ensuring safety under constraints remains a critical challenge for diffusion models. This paper proposes Constrained Diffusers, a novel framework that incorporates constraints into pre-trained diffusion models without retraining or architectural modifications. Inspired by constrained optimization, we apply a constrained Langevin sampling mechanism for the reverse diffusion process that jointly optimizes the trajectory and realizes constraint satisfaction through three iterative algorithms: projected method, primal-dual method and augmented Lagrangian approaches. In addition, we incorporate discrete control barrier functions as constraints for constrained diffusers to guarantee safety in online implementation. Experiments in Maze2D, locomotion, and pybullet ball running tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve constraint satisfaction with less computation time, and are competitive to existing methods in environments with static and time-varying constraints.

Title: GenControl: Generative AI-Driven Autonomous Design of Control Algorithms
Authors: Chenggang Cui, Jiaming Liu, Peifeng Hui, Pengfeng Lin, Chuanlin Zhang, Frede Blaabjerg
Abstract: Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design. Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.

Title: Experimental Verification of a Time-Domain Load Identification Method for Single-Phase Circuits
Authors: Francisco M. Arrabal-Campos, Francisco G. Montoya, Jorge Ventura, Santiago Sánchez-Acevedo, Raymundo E. Torres-Olguin, Francisco de León
Abstract: This paper presents experimental validation of a time-domain load parameter determination method for single-phase circuits. The verification is performed in a state-of-the-art smart grid laboratory equipped with power hardware and real-time emulators. The proposed method enables the identification of circuit parameters using only instantaneous voltage and current measurements at the point of common coupling. The experimental setup includes a range of test cases covering linear and non-sinusoidal single-phase conditions. Voltage and current waveforms are acquired, preprocessed, and used to calculate the relevant circuit parameters. The experimental results demonstrate a high degree of accuracy and robustness, with minimal percentage errors across all test cases. The identified parameters show excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations, confirming the validity and applicability of the proposed method to identify the load of single-phase systems. This validation highlights the potential of the method for improved monitoring, control, and protection of smart grids, paving the way for future extensions to three-phase systems and real-time implementations.

Title: ECLIP: Energy-efficient and Practical Co-Location of ML Inference on Spatially Partitioned GPUs
Authors: Ryan Quach, Yidi Wang, Ali Jahanshahi, Daniel Wong, Hyoseung Kim
Abstract: As AI inference becomes mainstream, research has begun to focus on improving the energy consumption of inference servers. Inference kernels commonly underutilize a GPU's compute resources and waste power from idling components. To improve utilization and energy efficiency, multiple models can co-locate and share the GPU. However, typical GPU spatial partitioning techniques often experience significant overheads when reconfiguring spatial partitions, which can waste additional energy through repartitioning overheads or non-optimal partition configurations. In this paper, we present ECLIP, a framework to enable low-overhead energy-efficient kernel-wise resource partitioning between co-located inference kernels. ECLIP minimizes repartitioning overheads by pre-allocating pools of CU masked streams and assigns optimal CU assignments to groups of kernels through our resource allocation optimizer. Overall, ECLIP achieves an average of 13% improvement to throughput and 25% improvement to energy efficiency.

Title: A Smooshed BMOCZ Zero Constellation for CFO Estimation Without Channel Coding
Authors: Anthony Joseph Perre, Parker Huggins, Alphan Sahin
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset (CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ, showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO. Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code (CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel, while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.

Title: Towards Neural Audio Codec Source Parsing
Authors: Orchid Chetia Phukan, Girish, Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Arun Balaji Buduru, Rajesh Sharma
Abstract: A new class of audio deepfakes-codecfakes (CFs)-has recently caught attention, synthesized by Audio Language Models that leverage neural audio codecs (NACs) in the backend. In response, the community has introduced dedicated benchmarks and tailored detection strategies. As the field advances, efforts have moved beyond binary detection toward source attribution, including open-set attribution, which aims to identify the NAC responsible for generation and flag novel, unseen ones during inference. This shift toward source attribution improves forensic interpretability and accountability. However, open-set attribution remains fundamentally limited: while it can detect that a NAC is unfamiliar, it cannot characterize or identify individual unseen codecs. It treats such inputs as generic ``unknowns'', lacking insight into their internal configuration. This leads to major shortcomings: limited generalization to new NACs and inability to resolve fine-grained variations within NAC families. To address these gaps, we propose Neural Audio Codec Source Parsing (NACSP) - a paradigm shift that reframes source attribution for CFs as structured regression over generative NAC parameters such as quantizers, bandwidth, and sampling rate. We formulate NACSP as a multi-task regression task for predicting these NAC parameters and establish the first comprehensive benchmark using various state-of-the-art speech pre-trained models (PTMs). To this end, we propose HYDRA, a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to disentangle complex latent properties from PTM representations. By employing task-specific attention over multiple curvature-aware hyperbolic subspaces, HYDRA enables superior multi-task generalization. Our extensive experiments show HYDRA achieves top results on benchmark CFs datasets compared to baselines operating in Euclidean space.

Title: Semi-Blind Channel Estimation for Downlink Communications Based on Dynamic Metasurface Antennas
Authors: Amarilton L. Magalhães, André L. F. de Almeida, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner, delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates, without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.

Title: Conditional Diffusion Model-Driven Generative Channels for Double RIS-Aided Wireless Systems
Authors: Yiyang Ni, Qi Zhang, Guangji Chen, Yan Cai, Jun Li, Shi Jin
Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation networks (6G), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have gained significant attention due to its ability of reconfiguring wireless channels via smart reflections. However, traditional channel state information (CSI) acquisition techniques for double-RIS systems face challenges (e.g., high pilot overhead or multipath interference). This paper proposes a new channel generation method in double-RIS communication systems based on the tool of conditional diffusion model (CDM). The CDM is trained on synthetic channel data to capture channel characteristics. It addresses the limitations of traditional CSI generation methods, such as insufficient model understanding capability and poor environmental adaptability. We provide a detailed analysis of the diffusion process for channel generation, and it is validated through simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CDM based method outperforms traditional channel acquisition methods in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE). This method offers a new paradigm for channel acquisition in double-RIS systems, which is expected to improve the quality of channel acquisition with low pilot overhead.

Title: Using Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM) to Model Hearing Loss and Cochlear Neural Degeneration
Authors: Ahsan J. Cheema, Sunil Puria
Abstract: Trouble hearing in noisy situations remains a common complaint for both individuals with hearing loss and individuals with normal hearing. This is hypothesized to arise due to condition called: cochlear neural degeneration (CND) which can also result in significant variabilities in hearing aids outcomes. This paper uses computational models of auditory periphery to simulate various hearing tasks. We present an objective method to quantify hearing loss and CND by comparing auditory nerve fiber responses using a Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM). Specifically study 1, shows that NSIM can be used to map performance of individuals with hearing loss on phoneme recognition task with reasonable accuracy. In the study 2, we show that NSIM is a sensitive measure that can also be used to capture the deficits resulting from CND and can be a candidate for noninvasive biomarker of auditory synaptopathy.

Title: Dynamic Scheduling for Enhanced Performance in RIS-assisted Cooperative Network with Interference
Authors: Yomali Lokugama, Saman Atapattu, Nathan Ross, Sithamparanathan Kandeepan, Chintha Tellambura
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as transformative technologies, enhancing spectral efficiency and improving interference management in multi-user cooperative communications. This paper investigates the integration of RIS with Flexible-Duplex (FlexD) communication, featuring dynamic scheduling capabilities, to mitigate unintended external interference in multi-user wireless networks. By leveraging the reconfigurability of RIS and dynamic scheduling, we propose a user-pair selection scheme to maximize system throughput when full channel state information (CSI) of interference is unavailable. We develop a mathematical framework to evaluate the throughput outage probability when RIS introduces spatial correlation. The derived analytical results are used for asymptotic analysis, providing insights into dynamic user scheduling under interference based on statistical channel knowledge. Finally, we compare FlexD with traditional Full Duplex (FD) and Half Duplex (HD) systems against RIS-assisted FlexD. Our results show FlexD's superior throughput enhancement, energy efficiency and data management capability in interference-affected networks, typical in current and next-generation cooperative wireless applications like cellular and vehicular communications.

Title: Frequency Dynamic Convolutions for Sound Event Detection
Authors: Hyeonuk Nam
Abstract: Recent research in deep learning-based Sound Event Detection (SED) has primarily focused on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) and Transformer models. However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume shift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to inconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of acoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based on the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance. FDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting multiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights. Experimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance on the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv has limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all frequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific characteristics. Additionally, the $3\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient to capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv) applies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the receptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature representation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by 9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high computational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution operations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary adaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D convolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv improves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of parameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv) extends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same dilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels with different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse frequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv achieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by 10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which assigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to effectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes TAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that focuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes transient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary properties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces the number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M), achieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise performance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary events, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral features, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events. Additionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting transient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable signal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide harmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD conv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc detection. These results suggest that frequency-adaptive convolutions and their extended variants provide a robust alternative to conventional 2D convolutions in deep learning-based audio processing.

Title: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Based Non-Invasive Chinese Speech Decoding
Authors: Zhihong Jia, Hongbin Wang, Yuanzhong Shen, Feng Hu, Jiayu An, Kai Shu, Dongrui Wu
Abstract: As an emerging paradigm of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), speech BCI has the potential to directly reflect auditory perception and thoughts, offering a promising communication alternative for patients with aphasia. Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first study on modality-assisted decoding for non-invasive speech BCIs.

Title: Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison
Authors: Jan C. Schulze, Alexander Mitsos
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.

Title: Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Enhanced Sub-THz ISAC Transmission for Air-Ground Network
Authors: Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within sub-THz frequencies is crucial for future air-ground networks, but unique propagation characteristics and hardware limitations present challenges in optimizing ISAC performance while increasing operational latency. This paper introduces a multi-modal sensing fusion framework inspired by synesthesia of machine (SoM) to enhance sub-THz ISAC transmission. By exploiting inherent degrees of freedom in sub-THz hardware and channels, the framework optimizes the radio-frequency environment. Squint-aware beam management is developed to improve air-ground network adaptability, enabling three-dimensional dynamic ISAC links. Leveraging multi-modal information, the framework enhances ISAC performance and reduces latency. Visual data rapidly localizes users and targets, while a customized multi-modal learning algorithm optimizes the hybrid precoder. A new metric provides comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves ISAC efficiency.

Title: Bridging Data-Driven and Physics-Based Models: A Consensus Multi-Model Kalman Filter for Robust Vehicle State Estimation
Authors: Farid Mafi (1), Ladan Khoshnevisan (1), Mohammad Pirani (2), Amir Khajepour (1) ((1) University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada, (2) University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada)
Abstract: Vehicle state estimation presents a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving systems, requiring both physical interpretability and the ability to capture complex nonlinear behaviors across diverse operating conditions. Traditional methodologies often rely exclusively on either physics-based or data-driven models, each with complementary strengths and limitations that become most noticeable during critical scenarios. This paper presents a novel consensus multi-model Kalman filter framework that integrates heterogeneous model types to leverage their complementary strengths while minimizing individual weaknesses. We introduce two distinct methodologies for handling covariance propagation in data-driven models: a Koopman operator-based linearization approach enabling analytical covariance propagation, and an ensemble-based method providing unified uncertainty quantification across model types without requiring pretraining. Our approach implements an iterative consensus fusion procedure that dynamically weighs different models based on their demonstrated reliability in current operating conditions. The experimental results conducted on an electric all-wheel-drive Equinox vehicle demonstrate performance improvements over single-model techniques, with particularly significant advantages during challenging maneuvers and varying road conditions, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Title: Low-Latency Terrestrial Interference Detection for Satellite-to-Device Communications
Authors: Runnan Liu, Weifeng Zhu, Shu Sun, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device communication is a promising future direction due to its lower latency and enhanced efficiency. However, intermittent and unpredictable terrestrial interference significantly affects system reliability and performance. Continuously employing sophisticated interference mitigation techniques is practically inefficient. Motivated by the periodic idle intervals characteristic of burst-mode satellite transmissions, this paper investigates online interference detection frameworks specifically tailored for satellite-to-device scenarios. We first rigorously formulate interference detection as a binary hypothesis testing problem, leveraging differences between Rayleigh (no interference) and Rice (interference present) distributions. Then, we propose a cumulative sum (CUSUM)-based online detector for scenarios with known interference directions, explicitly characterizing the trade-off between detection latency and false alarm rate, and establish its asymptotic optimality. For practical scenarios involving unknown interference direction, we further propose a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based detection method, jointly estimating interference direction via the Root-MUSIC algorithm. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve high detection accuracy with remarkably low latency, highlighting their practical applicability in future satellite-to-device communication systems.

Title: Interference Mitigation in STAR-RIS-Aided Multi-User Networks with Statistical CSI
Authors: Abuzar B. M. Adam, Mohammed A. M. Elhassan, Elhadj Moustapha Diallo, Mohamed Amine Ouamri
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate real-time interference mitigation in multiuser wireless networks assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). Unlike conventional methods that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we consider a practical scenario where only statistical CSI is available, and the STAR-RIS phase shifts are impaired by random phase errors modeled via the Von Mises distribution. To tackle the resulting nonconvex optimization problem induced by unit-modulus constraints and stochastic interference, we derive a closed-form approximation of the effective channel matrix using statistical expectations. We then reformulate the interference minimization problem as an unconstrained optimization over a Riemannian manifold and propose a conjugate gradient algorithm tailored to the complex circle manifold. The proposed solution enables efficient real-time computation of optimal phase shifts while accounting for hardware imperfections and limited CSI. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly suppresses inter-user interference and achieves superior SINR performance and convergence speed compared to conventional baselines.

Title: MORIC: CSI Delay-Doppler Decomposition for Robust Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Navid Hasanzadeh, Shahrokh Valaee
Abstract: The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7 GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition, particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy, enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.

Title: Joint Spectrum Sensing and Resource Allocation for OFDMA-based Underwater Acoustic Communications
Authors: Minwoo Kim, Youngchol Choi, Yeongjun Kim, Eojin Seo, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications generally rely on cognitive radio (CR)-based ad-hoc networks due to challenges such as long propagation delay, limited channel resources, and high attenuation. To address the constraints of limited frequency resources, UWA communications have recently incorporated orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), significantly enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) through multiplexing gains. Still, {the} low propagation speed of UWA signals, combined with {the} dynamic underwater environment, creates asynchrony in multiple access scenarios. This causes inaccurate spectrum sensing as inter-carrier interference (ICI) increases, which leads to difficulties in resource allocation. As efficient resource allocation is essential for achieving high-quality communication in OFDMA-based CR networks, these challenges degrade communication reliability in UWA systems. To resolve the issue, we propose an end-to-end sensing and resource optimization method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in an OFDMA-based UWA-CR network. Through extensive simulations, we confirm that the proposed method is superior to baseline schemes, outperforming other methods by 42.9 % in SE and 4.4 % in communication success rate.

Title: Condition Monitoring with Machine Learning: A Data-Driven Framework for Quantifying Wind Turbine Energy Loss
Authors: Emil Marcus Buchberg, Kent Vugs Nielsen
Abstract: Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35 turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine downtime.

Title: Collaborative Beamforming for Communication Applications Using a Two-Element Fully-Wireless Open-Loop Coherent Distributed Array
Authors: Jason M. Merlo, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a proof of concept of a fully-wireless two-node open-loop coherent distributed communication system and evaluate its performance by transmitting QPSK , 64-, and 256-QAM constellations at a symbol rate of 2 MBd over a 58 m link in an urban environment. The system is implemented in a distributed manner with on-node processing using software-defined radios (SDRs) and wireless internode communication to share coordination information and does not rely on external time or frequency references such as the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). In each experiment ~100 messages were transmitted and a mean coherent gain of 0.936 was achieved across all measurements with a mean symbol error ratio of below $1.4\times 10^{-4}$ achieved up to 64-QAM, demonstrating a reliable bandwidth of up to 12 Mbps.

Title: ZipVoice: Fast and High-Quality Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Flow Matching
Authors: Han Zhu, Wei Kang, Zengwei Yao, Liyong Guo, Fangjun Kuang, Zhaoqing Li, Weiji Zhuang, Long Lin, Daniel Povey
Abstract: Existing large-scale zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models deliver high speech quality but suffer from slow inference speeds due to massive parameters. To address this issue, this paper introduces ZipVoice, a high-quality flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS model with a compact model size and fast inference speed. Key designs include: 1) a Zipformer-based flow-matching decoder to maintain adequate modeling capabilities under constrained size; 2) Average upsampling-based initial speech-text alignment and Zipformer-based text encoder to improve speech intelligibility; 3) A flow distillation method to reduce sampling steps and eliminate the inference overhead associated with classifier-free guidance. Experiments on 100k hours multilingual datasets show that ZipVoice matches state-of-the-art models in speech quality, while being 3 times smaller and up to 30 times faster than a DiT-based flow-matching baseline. Codes, model checkpoints and demo samples are publicly available.

Title: Online-Optimized Gated Radial Basis Function Neural Network-Based Adaptive Control
Authors: Mingcong Li
Abstract: Real-time adaptive control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and time-varying disturbances demands precise modeling and robust parameter adaptation. While existing neural network-based strategies struggle with computational inefficiency or inadequate temporal dependencies, this study proposes a hybrid control framework integrating a Temporal-Gated Radial Basis Function (TGRBF) network with a nonlinear robust controller. The TGRBF synergizes radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) through dynamic gating, enabling efficient offline system identification and online temporal modeling with minimal parameter overhead (14.5% increase vs. RBFNNs). During control execution, an event-triggered optimization mechanism activates momentum-explicit gradient descent to refine network parameters, leveraging historical data to suppress overfitting while maintaining real-time feasibility. Concurrently, the nonlinear controller adaptively tunes its gains via Jacobian-driven rules derived from the TGRBF model, ensuring rapid error convergence and disturbance rejection. Lyapunov-based analysis rigorously guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of both tracking errors and adaptive parameters. Simulations on a nonlinear benchmark system demonstrate the framework's superiority: compared to PID and fixed-gain robust controllers, the proposed method reduces settling time by 14.2%, limits overshoot to 10%, and achieves 48.4% lower integral time-weighted absolute error under dynamic disturbances. By unifying data-driven adaptability with stability-guaranteed control, this work advances real-time performance in partially observable, time-varying industrial systems.

Title: DoA Estimation using MUSIC with Range/Doppler Multiplexing for MIMO-OFDM Radar
Authors: Murat Babek Salman, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Sensing emerges as a critical challenge in 6G networks, which require simultaneous communication and target sensing capabilities. State-of-the-art super-resolution techniques for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation encounter significant performance limitations when the number of targets exceeds antenna array dimensions. This paper introduces a novel sensing parameter estimation algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems. The proposed approach implements a strategic two-stage methodology: first, discriminating targets through delay and Doppler domain filtering to reduce the number of effective targets for super-resolution DoA estimation, and second, introducing a fusion technique to mitigate sidelobe interferences. The algorithm enables robust DoA estimation, particularly in high-density target environments with limited-size antenna arrays. Numerical simulations validate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to conventional DoA estimation approaches.

Title: RL-Guided MPC for Autonomous Greenhouse Control
Authors: Salim Msaad, Murray Harraway, Robert D. McAllister
Abstract: The efficient operation of greenhouses is essential for enhancing crop yield while minimizing energy costs. This paper investigates a control strategy that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize economic benefits in autonomous greenhouses. Previous research has explored the use of RL and MPC for greenhouse control individually, or by using MPC as the function approximator for the RL agent. This study introduces the RL-Guided MPC framework, where a RL policy is trained and then used to construct a terminal cost and terminal region constraint for the MPC optimization problem. This approach leverages the ability to handle uncertainties of RL with MPC's online optimization to improve overall control performance. The RL-Guided MPC framework is compared with both MPC and RL via numerical simulations. Two scenarios are considered: a deterministic environment and an uncertain environment. Simulation results demonstrate that, in both environments, RL-Guided MPC outperforms both RL and MPC with shorter prediction horizons.

Title: Boundary-Informed Sound Field Reconstruction
Authors: David Sundström, Filip Elvander, Andreas Jakobsson
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the sound field in a room using prior information of the boundary geometry, represented as a point cloud. In general, when no boundary information is available, an accurate sound field reconstruction over a large spatial region and at high frequencies requires numerous microphone measurements. On the other hand, if all geometrical and acoustical aspects of the boundaries are known, the sound field could, in theory, be simulated without any measurements. In this work, we address the intermediate case, where only partial or uncertain boundary information is available. This setting is similar to one studied in virtual reality applications, where the goal is to create a perceptually convincing audio experience. In this work, we focus on spatial sound control applications, which in contrast require an accurate sound field reconstruction. Therefore, we formulate the problem within a linear Bayesian framework, incorporating a boundary-informed prior derived from impedance boundary conditions. The formulation allows for joint optimization of the unknown hyperparameters, including the noise and signal variances and the impedance boundary conditions. Using numerical experiments, we show that incorporating the boundary-informed prior significantly enhances the reconstruction, notably even when only a few hundreds of boundary points are available or when the boundary positions are calibrated with an uncertainty up to 1 dm.

Title: Stability and Performance of Online Feedback Optimization for Distribution Grid Flexibility
Authors: Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Tina Möllemann, Irina Zettl, Andreas Ulbig
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into sub-transmission systems has enabled new opportunities for flexibility provision in ancillary services such as frequency and voltage support, as well as congestion management. This paper investigates the stability and performance of Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers in ensuring reliable flexibility provision. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, emphasizing safe transitions between system states within the Feasible Operating Region (FOR). We evaluate the controller's stability and performance through simulations of transitions to the vertices of the FOR, analyzing the impact of tuning parameters. The study demonstrates that controller stability is sensitive to parameter tuning, particularly gain and sensitivity approximations. Results demonstrate that improper tuning can lead to oscillatory or unstable behavior, highlighting the need for systematic parameter selection to ensure reliable operation across the full flexibility range.

Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are critical for modern power networks, supporting grid services such as frequency regulation, peak shaving, and black start. Delivering a BESS under an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) model requires a concise methodology that balances regulatory compliance, technical details, and schedule efficiency. This paper presents a streamlined, five step EPC framework covering feasibility assessment, permitting, procurement, construction, and commissioning. A Danish demonstration (the BOSS project on Bornholm) serves as a case study.

Title: Aggregating Inverter-Based Resources for Fast Frequency Response: A Nash Bargaining Game-Based Approach
Authors: Xiang Zhu, Hua Geng, Hongyang Qing, Xin Zou
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach for grid-level frequency regulation by aggregating inverter-based resources (IBRs). Virtual power plants (VPPs), acting as aggregators, can efficiently respond to dynamic response requirements from the grid. Through parametric modeling, grid-level frequency regulation requirements are accurately quantified and translated into a feasible parameter region defined by device-level parameters. Based on this feasible region, an MOO model is developed to address the conflicting demands of IBRs during frequency response. A Nash bargaining game-based approach is then employed to optimally allocate regulation requirements within the VPP, balancing the various demands of the IBRs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing frequency stability and improving coordination among IBRs.

Title: SUSEP-Net: Simulation-Supervised and Contrastive Learning-based Deep Neural Networks for Susceptibility Source Separation
Authors: Min Li, Chen Chen, Zhenghao Li, Yin Liu, Shanshan Shan, Peng Wu, Pengfei Rong, Feng Liu, G. Bruce Pike, Alan H.Wilman, Hongfu Sun, Yang Gao
Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides a valuable tool for quantifying susceptibility distributions in human brains; however, two types of opposing susceptibility sources (i.e., paramagnetic and diamagnetic), may coexist in a single voxel, and cancel each other out in net QSM images. Susceptibility source separation techniques enable the extraction of sub-voxel information from QSM maps. This study proposes a novel SUSEP-Net for susceptibility source separation by training a dual-branch U-net with a simulation-supervised training strategy. In addition, a contrastive learning framework is included to explicitly impose similarity-based constraints between the branch-specific guidance features in specially-designed encoders and the latent features in the decoders. Comprehensive experiments were carried out on both simulated and in vivo data, including healthy subjects and patients with pathological conditions, to compare SUSEP-Net with three state-of-the-art susceptibility source separation methods (i.e., APART-QSM, \c{hi}-separation, and \c{hi}-sepnet). SUSEP-Net consistently showed improved results compared with the other three methods, with better numerical metrics, improved high-intensity hemorrhage and calcification lesion contrasts, and reduced artifacts in brains with pathological conditions. In addition, experiments on an agarose gel phantom data were conducted to validate the accuracy and the generalization capability of SUSEP-Net.

Title: Instance-Specific Test-Time Training for Speech Editing in the Wild
Authors: Taewoo Kim, Uijong Lee, Hayoung Park, Choongsang Cho, Nam In Park, Young Han Lee
Abstract: Speech editing systems aim to naturally modify speech content while preserving acoustic consistency and speaker identity. However, previous studies often struggle to adapt to unseen and diverse acoustic conditions, resulting in degraded editing performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose an instance-specific test-time training method for speech editing in the wild. Our approach employs direct supervision from ground-truth acoustic features in unedited regions, and indirect supervision in edited regions via auxiliary losses based on duration constraints and phoneme prediction. This strategy mitigates the bandwidth discontinuity problem in speech editing, ensuring smooth acoustic transitions between unedited and edited regions. Additionally, it enables precise control over speech rate by adapting the model to target durations via mask length adjustment during test-time training. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing speech editing systems in both objective and subjective evaluations.

Title: Performance Analysis of Communication Signals for Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks
Authors: Ashwani Koul, Gustaf Hendeby, Isaac Skog
Abstract: Fusion of passive and active measurements from sensor nodes becomes critical in localizing underwater objects and is traditionally achieved by communicating information to a central node. This causes significant inefficiencies in bandwidth, energy, and processing time, which are critical in marine applications. With integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the process of sensing, localization, and communication can be achieved jointly, and the inefficiencies can be minimized. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to analyse the efficacy of such communication signals in localizing a moving target in given underwater conditions. The Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is a performance metric used to determine the theoretical lower bound on localization errors. Simulation results illustrate the contours of localization error across various scenarios, offering valuable insights into system performance under different target dynamics and sea state conditions, showcasing their potential for efficient and reliable underwater localization applications.

Title: Voltage Stability of Inverter-Based Systems: Impact of Parameters and Irrelevance of Line Dynamics
Authors: Sushobhan Chatterjee, Sijia Geng
Abstract: This paper investigates voltage stability in inverter-based power systems concerning fold and saddle-node bifurcations. An analytical expression is derived for the sensitivity of the stability margin using the normal vector to the bifurcation hypersurface. Such information enables efficient identification of effective control parameters in mitigating voltage instability. Comprehensive analysis reveals that reactive loading setpoint and current controller's feedforward gain are the most influential parameters for enhancing voltage stability in a grid-following (GFL) inverter system, while the voltage controller's feedforward gain plays a dominant role in a grid-forming (GFM) inverter. Notably, both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that transmission line dynamics have no impact on fold/saddle-node bifurcations in these systems. Results in this paper provide insights for efficient analysis and control in future inverter-dominated power systems through reductions in parameter space and model complexity.

Title: A Model-Free Detection Method for Internal Short Circuits in Single Lithium-ion Cells Using Pseudo Open-Circuit Voltage Difference
Authors: Yangyang Xu, Chenglin Liao
Abstract: This letter proposes a lightweight, model-free online diagnostic framework for detecting internal short circuits (ISC) in single lithium-ion cells under dynamic operating conditions. The core of the method lies in computing the first-order difference of pseudo open-circuit voltage ($\boldsymbol{\mathrm{OCV}_{\text{pseudo}}}$) to extract high-frequency deviations caused by ISC events from low-frequency polarization variations. The method relies solely on terminal voltage, current measurements, and an offline $R_0$--SOC look-up table, thereby eliminating the need for electrochemical or equivalent-circuit observers. Validated on ten real and one false fault scenarios, the proposed approach achieves a 100\% detection success rate with no missed or false alarms. In addition, the proposed method exhibits extremely low computational and memory requirements, making it highly suitable for real-time deployment in battery management systems (BMS).

Title: HELENA: High-Efficiency Learning-based channel Estimation using dual Neural Attention
Authors: Miguel Camelo Botero, Esra Aycan Beyazit, Nina Slamnik-Kriještorac, Johann M. Marquez-Barja
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for high-performance Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing systems such as 5G New Radio, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio and stringent latency constraints. This letter presents HELENA, a compact deep learning model that combines a lightweight convolutional backbone with two efficient attention mechanisms: patch-wise multi-head self-attention for capturing global dependencies and a squeeze-and-excitation block for local feature refinement. Compared to CEViT, a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based estimator, HELENA reduces inference time by 45.0\% (0.175\,ms vs.\ 0.318\,ms), achieves comparable accuracy ($-16.78$\,dB vs.\ $-17.30$\,dB), and requires $8\times$ fewer parameters (0.11M vs.\ 0.88M), demonstrating its suitability for low-latency, real-time deployment.

Title: BUT System for the MLC-SLM Challenge
Authors: Alexander Polok, Jiangyu Han, Dominik Klement, Samuele Cornell, Jan Černocký, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: We present a two-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that combines DiCoW -- a diarization-conditioned variant of Whisper -- with DiariZen, a diarization pipeline built on top of Pyannote. We first evaluate both systems in out-of-domain (OOD) multilingual scenarios without any fine-tuning. In this scenario, DiariZen consistently outperforms the baseline Pyannote diarization model, demonstrating strong generalization. Despite being fine-tuned on English-only data for target-speaker ASR, DiCoW retains solid multilingual performance, indicating that encoder modifications preserve Whisper's multilingual capabilities. We then fine-tune both DiCoW and DiariZen on the MLC-SLM challenge data. The fine-tuned DiariZen continues to outperform the fine-tuned Pyannote baseline, while DiCoW sees further gains from domain adaptation. Our final system achieves a micro-average tcpWER/CER of 16.75% and ranks second in Task 2 of the MLC-SLM challenge. Lastly, we identify several labeling inconsistencies in the training data -- such as missing speech segments and incorrect silence annotations -- which can hinder diarization fine-tuning. We propose simple mitigation strategies to address these issues and improve system robustness.

Title: Audio-Visual Driven Compression for Low-Bitrate Talking Head Videos
Authors: Riku Takahashi, Ryugo Morita, Jinjia Zhou
Abstract: Talking head video compression has advanced with neural rendering and keypoint-based methods, but challenges remain, especially at low bit rates, including handling large head movements, suboptimal lip synchronization, and distorted facial reconstructions. To address these problems, we propose a novel audio-visual driven video codec that integrates compact 3D motion features and audio signals. This approach robustly models significant head rotations and aligns lip movements with speech, improving both compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Experiments on the CelebV-HQ dataset show that our method reduces bitrate by 22% compared to VVC and by 8.5% over state-of-the-art learning-based codec. Furthermore, it provides superior lip-sync accuracy and visual fidelity at comparable bitrates, highlighting its effectiveness in bandwidth-constrained scenarios.

Title: Stereo sound event localization and detection based on PSELDnet pretraining and BiMamba sequence modeling
Authors: Wenmiao Gao, Yang Xiao
Abstract: Pre-training methods have achieved significant performance improvements in sound event localization and detection (SELD) tasks, but existing Transformer-based models suffer from high computational complexity. In this work, we propose a stereo sound event localization and detection system based on pre-trained PSELDnet and bidirectional Mamba sequence modeling. We replace the Conformer module with a BiMamba module and introduce asymmetric convolutions to more effectively model the spatiotemporal relationships between time and frequency dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the baseline and the original PSELDnet with Conformer decoder architecture on the DCASE2025 Task 3 development dataset, while also reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the BiMamba architecture in addressing the challenges of the SELD task.

Title: High-gain model-following control for trajectory tracking
Authors: Nicals Tietze, Kai Wulff, Johann Reger
Abstract: We consider trajectory tracking for minimum-phase nonlinear systems in Byrnes-Isidori form using the model-following control (MFC) architecture. The tracking problem is motivated by a hierarchical control concept where a higher-level instance provides the reference trajectory at run-time. We present a computational efficient implementation of the feedback linearisation MFC design, and apply high-gain feedback in the process control loop (PCL) to achieve practical tracking in presence of Lipschitz perturbations. Our main results establish ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and give a constructive bound for the high-gain scaling parameter to achieve arbitrary tracking precision. Further we establish that the peaking phenomenon can be attenuated using MFC. We demonstrate the results via an automotive case study considering advanced engine-based cruise control.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS) Meet Multiple Access: NOMA or OMA?
Authors: Qiao Ren, Xidong Mu, Siyu Lin, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A fundamental two-user PASS-based communication system is considered under three MA schemes, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). For each MA scheme, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated to minimize the required transmit power for satisfying users' rate requirements. For NOMA and FDMA, a two-stage algorithm is proposed, where the locations of PAs are derived sequentially by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and fine-turning phase adjustment. For TDMA, by leveraging the time-switching feature of PASS, the optimal pinching beamforming of each time slot is derived to maximize the served user channel gain. Numerical results are provided to show that: 1) PASS can achieve a significant performance gain over conventional antenna systems, and 2) NOMA consistently outperforms FDMA, while TDMA provides superior performance than NOMA for symmetric user rate requirements.

One of the key challenges remains the reliable acquisition of high-resolution, geo-referenced spatial information to support core activities such as extraction planning and on-site monitoring. This work presents an integrated system architecture that combines UAV-based sensing, LiDAR terrain modeling, and deep learning-based object detection to generate spatially accurate information for open-pit mining environments. The proposed pipeline includes geo-referencing, 3D reconstruction, and object localization, enabling structured spatial outputs to be integrated into an industrial digital twin platform. Unlike traditional static surveying methods, the system offers higher coverage and automation potential, with modular components suitable for deployment in real-world industrial contexts. While the current implementation operates in post-flight batch mode, it lays the foundation for real-time extensions. The system contributes to the development of AI-enhanced remote sensing in mining by demonstrating a scalable and field-validated geospatial data workflow that supports situational awareness and infrastructure safety.

Title: Hybrid Polynomial Zonotopes: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis in Hybrid Nonaffine Systems
Authors: Peng Xie, Zhen Zhang, Amr Alanwar
Abstract: Reachability analysis for hybrid nonaffine systems remains computationally challenging, as existing set representations--including constrained, polynomial, and hybrid zonotopes--either lose tightness under high-order nonaffine maps or suffer exponential blow-up after discrete jumps. This paper introduces Hybrid Polynomial Zonotope (HPZ), a novel set representation that combines the mode-dependent generator structure of hybrid zonotopes with the algebraic expressiveness of polynomial zonotopes. HPZs compactly encode non-convex reachable states across modes by attaching polynomial exponents to each hybrid generator, enabling precise capture of high-order state-input couplings without vertex enumeration. We develop a comprehensive library of HPZ operations, including Minkowski sum, linear transformation, and intersection. Theoretical analysis and computational experiments demonstrate that HPZs achieve superior tightness preservation and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches for hybrid system reachability analysis.

Title: BattBee: Equivalent Circuit Modeling and Early Detection of Thermal Runaway Triggered by Internal Short Circuits for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Sangwon Kang, Hao Tu, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the enabling power source for transportation electrification. However, in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to internal short circuits (ISCs) and the consequential risk of thermal runaway (TR). Toward addressing the challenge of ISCs and TR, we undertake a systematic study that extends from dynamic modeling to fault detection in this paper. First, we develop {\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach. The research outcomes underscore this study's potential for real-world battery safety risk management.

Title: Parallel Branch Model Predictive Control on GPUs
Authors: Luyao Zhang, Chenghuai Lin, Sergio Grammatico
Abstract: We present a parallel GPU-accelerated solver for branch Model Predictive Control problems. Based on iterative LQR methods, our solver exploits the tree-sparse structure and implements temporal parallelism using the parallel scan algorithm. Consequently, the proposed solver enables parallelism across both the prediction horizon and the scenarios. In addition, we utilize an augmented Lagrangian method to handle general inequality constraints. We compare our solver with state-of-the-art numerical solvers in two automated driving applications. The numerical results demonstrate that, compared to CPU-based solvers, our solver achieves competitive performance for problems with short horizons and small-scale trees, while outperforming other solvers on large-scale problems.

Title: Deceptive Path Planning: A Bayesian Game Approach
Authors: Violetta Rostobaya, James Berneburg, Yue Guan, Michael Dorothy, Daigo Shishika
Abstract: This paper investigates how an autonomous agent can transmit information through its motion in an adversarial setting. We consider scenarios where an agent must reach its goal while deceiving an intelligent observer about its destination. We model this interaction as a dynamic Bayesian game between a mobile Attacker with a privately known goal and a Defender who infers the Attacker's intent to allocate defensive resources effectively. We use Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE) as our solution concept and propose a computationally efficient approach to find it. In the resulting equilibrium, the Defender employs a simple Markovian strategy, while the Attacker strategically balances deception and goal efficiency by stochastically mixing shortest and non-shortest paths to manipulate the Defender's beliefs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of our PBNE-based strategies over existing methods based on one-sided optimization.

Authors: Bi Yuda, Jia Sihan, Gao Yutong, Abrol Anees, Fu Zening, Calhoun Vince
Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging integrates diverse data types, such as structural and functional neuroimaging, to provide complementary insights that enhance deep learning predictions and improve outcomes. This study focuses on a neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model, \textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally, we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and demonstrates strong scalability and portability.

Title: SpeechRefiner: Towards Perceptual Quality Refinement for Front-End Algorithms
Authors: Sirui Li, Shuai Wang, Zhijun Liu, Zhongjie Jiang, Yannan Wang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Speech pre-processing techniques such as denoising, de-reverberation, and separation, are commonly employed as front-ends for various downstream speech processing tasks. However, these methods can sometimes be inadequate, resulting in residual noise or the introduction of new artifacts. Such deficiencies are typically not captured by metrics like SI-SNR but are noticeable to human listeners. To address this, we introduce SpeechRefiner, a post-processing tool that utilizes Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to improve the perceptual quality of speech. In this study, we benchmark SpeechRefiner against recent task-specific refinement methods and evaluate its performance within our internal processing pipeline, which integrates multiple front-end algorithms. Experiments show that SpeechRefiner exhibits strong generalization across diverse impairment sources, significantly enhancing speech perceptual quality. Audio demos can be found at this https URL.

Title: Intelligent Metasurface-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Unified Framework and Key Technologies
Authors: Shunyu Li, Tianqi Mao, Guangyao Liu, Fan Zhang, Ruiqi Liu, Meng Hua, Zhen Gao, Qingqing Wu, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming strategies, and dual-functional waveform design.

Title: Robust Recursive Fusion of Multiresolution Multispectral Images with Location-Aware Neural Networks
Authors: Haoqing Li, Ricardo Borsoi, Tales Imbiriba, Pau Closas
Abstract: Multiresolution image fusion is a key problem for real-time satellite imaging and plays a central role in detecting and monitoring natural phenomena such as floods. It aims to solve the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution in remote sensing instruments. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this problem, the presence of outliers such as clouds downgrades their performance. Moreover, strategies that integrate robustness, recursive operation and learned models are missing. In this paper, a robust recursive image fusion framework leveraging location-aware neural networks (NN) to model the image dynamics is proposed. Outliers are modeled by representing the probability of contamination of a given pixel and band. A NN model trained on a small dataset provides accurate predictions of the stochastic image time evolution, which improves both the accuracy and robustness of the method. A recursive solution is proposed to estimate the high-resolution images using a Bayesian variational inference framework. Experiments fusing images from the Landsat 8 and MODIS instruments show that the proposed approach is significantly more robust against cloud cover, without losing performance when no clouds are present.

Title: The Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Scattering Transform and Its Application in Classification Tasks
Authors: Leonardo Fonseca Larrubia, Pedro Alberto Morettin, Chang Chiann
Abstract: We present the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Scattering Transform (MODWST), whose construction is inspired by the combination of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and the Scattering Wavelet Transform (WST). We also discuss the use of MODWST in classification tasks, evaluating its performance in two applications: stationary signal classification and ECG signal classification. The results demonstrate that MODWST achieved good performance in both applications, positioning itself as a viable alternative to popular methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when the training data set is limited.

Title: From Proxies to Fields: Spatiotemporal Reconstruction of Global Radiation from Sparse Sensor Sequences
Authors: Kazuma Kobayashi, Samrendra Roy, Seid Koric, Diab Abueidda, Syed Bahauddin Alam
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements. Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem: reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days, and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Title: TuneGenie: Reasoning-based LLM agents for preferential music generation
Authors: Amitesh Pandey, Jafarbek Arifdjanov, Ansh Tiwari
Abstract: Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise across a diversity of tasks, ranging from generating images to reasoning spatially. Considering their remarkable (and growing) textual reasoning capabilities, we investigate LLMs' potency in conducting analyses of an individual's preferences in music (based on playlist metadata, personal write-ups, etc.) and producing effective prompts (based on these analyses) to be passed to Suno AI (a generative AI tool for music production). Our proposition of a novel LLM-based textual representation to music model (which we call TuneGenie) and the various methods we develop to evaluate & benchmark similar models add to the increasing (and increasingly controversial) corpus of research on the use of AI in generating art.

Title: Adapting Whisper for Streaming Speech Recognition via Two-Pass Decoding
Authors: Haoran Zhou, Xingchen Song, Brendan Fahy, Qiaochu Song, Binbin Zhang, Zhendong Peng, Anshul Wadhawan, Denglin Jiang, Apurv Verma, Vinay Ramesh, Srivas Prasad, Michele M. Franceschini
Abstract: OpenAI Whisper is a family of robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models trained on 680,000 hours of audio. However, its encoder-decoder architecture, trained with a sequence-to-sequence objective, lacks native support for streaming ASR. In this paper, we fine-tune Whisper for streaming ASR using the WeNet toolkit by adopting a Unified Two-pass (U2) structure. We introduce an additional Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder trained with causal attention masks to generate streaming partial transcripts, while the original Whisper decoder reranks these partial outputs. Our experiments on LibriSpeech and an earnings call dataset demonstrate that, with adequate fine-tuning data, Whisper can be adapted into a capable streaming ASR model. We also introduce a hybrid tokenizer approach, which uses a smaller token space for the CTC decoder while retaining Whisper's original token space for the attention decoder, resulting in improved data efficiency and generalization.

Title: Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds
Authors: Caio F. Deberaldini Netto, Zhiyang Wang, Luana Ruiz
Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.

Title: ViSAGe: Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation
Authors: Jaeyeon Kim, Heeseung Yun, Gunhee Kim
Abstract: Spatial audio is essential for enhancing the immersiveness of audio-visual experiences, yet its production typically demands complex recording systems and specialized expertise. In this work, we address a novel problem of generating first-order ambisonics, a widely used spatial audio format, directly from silent videos. To support this task, we introduce YT-Ambigen, a dataset comprising 102K 5-second YouTube video clips paired with corresponding first-order ambisonics. We also propose new evaluation metrics to assess the spatial aspect of generated audio based on audio energy maps and saliency metrics. Furthermore, we present Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation (ViSAGe), an end-to-end framework that generates first-order ambisonics from silent video frames by leveraging CLIP visual features, autoregressive neural audio codec modeling with both directional and visual guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that ViSAGe produces plausible and coherent first-order ambisonics, outperforming two-stage approaches consisting of video-to-audio generation and audio spatialization. Qualitative examples further illustrate that ViSAGe generates temporally aligned high-quality spatial audio that adapts to viewpoint changes.

Title: Functional Multi-Reference Alignment via Deconvolution
Authors: Omar Al-Ghattas, Anna Little, Daniel Sanz-Alonso, Mikhail Sweeney
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem of estimating a signal function from shifted, noisy observations. Our functional formulation reveals a new connection between MRA and deconvolution: the signal can be estimated from second-order statistics via Kotlarski's formula, an important identification result in deconvolution with replicated measurements. To design our MRA algorithms, we extend Kotlarski's formula to general dimension and study the estimation of signals with vanishing Fourier transform, thus also contributing to the deconvolution literature. We validate our deconvolution approach to MRA through both theory and numerical experiments.

Title: SSLAM: Enhancing Self-Supervised Models with Audio Mixtures for Polyphonic Soundscapes
Authors: Tony Alex, Sara Ahmed, Armin Mustafa, Muhammad Awais, Philip JB Jackson
Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio. However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex, involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios, remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a 3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\% (mAP).

Title: Improving Speech Enhancement with Multi-Metric Supervision from Learned Quality Assessment
Authors: Wei Wang, Wangyou Zhang, Chenda Li, Jiatong Shi, Shinji Watanabe, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) aims to predict the perceived quality of speech signals under a wide range of distortions. It is inherently connected to speech enhancement (SE), which seeks to improve speech quality by removing unwanted signal components. While SQA models are widely used to evaluate SE performance, their potential to guide SE training remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate a training framework that leverages a SQA model, trained to predict multiple evaluation metrics from a public SE leaderboard, as a supervisory signal for SE. This approach addresses a key limitation of conventional SE objectives, such as SI-SNR, which often fail to align with perceptual quality and generalize poorly across evaluation metrics. Moreover, it enables training on real-world data where clean references are unavailable. Experiments on both simulated and real-world test sets show that SQA-guided training consistently improves performance across a range of quality metrics.

Title: A Survey of Foundation Models for IoT: Taxonomy and Criteria-Based Analysis
Authors: Hui Wei, Dong Yoon Lee, Shubham Rohal, Zhizhang Hu, Shiwei Fang, Shijia Pan
Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is the cornerstone of the modern IT industry. However, managing this infrastructure effectively requires considerable manual effort from the DevOps engineering team. We make a case for developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to automate cloud infrastructure management tasks. In a preliminary study, we investigate the potential for AI agents to use different cloud/user interfaces such as software development kits (SDK), command line interfaces (CLI), Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platforms, and web portals. We report takeaways on their effectiveness on different management tasks, and identify research challenges and potential solutions.

Title: Role of Uncertainty in Model Development and Control Design for a Manufacturing Process
Authors: Rongfei Li, Francis Assadian
Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform machines, especially in the micro scale manufacturing, which requires high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for high level of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment. Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity) etc. Although advanced metrology sensors and high-precision microprocessors, which are utilized in nowadays robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic errors in robot positioning, but a well-designed control algorithm still works as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system can reduce various uncertainties to a great amount.

Title: Phonikud: Hebrew Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion for Real-Time Text-to-Speech
Authors: Yakov Kolani, Maxim Melichov, Cobi Calev, Morris Alper
Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight, open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P and as training data for TTS systems. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at this https URL.

Title: Explosive Output to Enhance Jumping Ability: A Variable Reduction Ratio Design Paradigm for Humanoid Robots Knee Joint
Authors: Xiaoshuai Ma, Haoxiang Qi, Qingqing Li, Haochen Xu, Xuechao Chen, Junyao Gao, Zhangguo Yu, Qiang Huang
Abstract: Enhancing the explosive power output of the knee joints is critical for improving the agility and obstacle-crossing capabilities of humanoid robots. However, a mismatch between the knee-to-center-of-mass (CoM) transmission ratio and jumping demands, coupled with motor performance degradation at high speeds, restricts the duration of high-power output and limits jump performance. To address these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design paradigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive output during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee kinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction ratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly increases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes motor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained high-power output. A compact and efficient linear actuator-driven guide-rod mechanism realizes this coupling strategy, supported by parameter optimization guided by explosive jump control strategies. Experimental validation demonstrated a 63 cm vertical jump on a single-joint platform (a theoretical improvement of 28.1\% over the optimal fixed-ratio joints). Integrated into a humanoid robot, the proposed design enabled a 1.1 m long jump, a 0.5 m vertical jump, and a 0.5 m box jump.

Title: GSDNet: Revisiting Incomplete Multimodal-Diffusion from Graph Spectrum Perspective for Conversation Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yuntao Shou, Jun Yao, Tao Meng, Wei Ai, Cen Chen, Keqin Li
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) aims to infer the speaker's emotional state by analyzing utterance information from multiple sources (i.e., video, audio, and text). Compared with unimodality, a more robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network (GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological information and important spectral features during the diffusion process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.

Title: Relative Entropy Regularized Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Encrypted Policy Synthesis
Authors: Jihoon Suh, Yeongjun Jang, Kaoru Teranishi, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: We propose an efficient encrypted policy synthesis to develop privacy-preserving model-based reinforcement learning. We first demonstrate that the relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework offers a computationally convenient linear and ``min-free'' structure for value iteration, enabling a direct and efficient integration of fully homomorphic encryption with bootstrapping into policy synthesis. Convergence and error bounds are analyzed as encrypted policy synthesis propagates errors under the presence of encryption-induced errors including quantization and bootstrapping. Theoretical analysis is validated by numerical simulations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RERL framework in integrating FHE for encrypted policy synthesis.

Title: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multi-Modal Semantic Communications
Authors: Guojun Huang, Jiancheng An, Lu Gan, Dusit Niyato, Mérouane Debbah, Tie Jun Cui
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) powered by generative artificial intelligence enables highly efficient and reliable information transmission. However, it still necessitates the transmission of substantial amounts of data when dealing with complex scene information. In contrast, the stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), leveraging wave-domain computing, provides a cost-effective solution for directly imaging complex scenes. Building on this concept, we propose an innovative SIM-aided multi-modal SemCom system. Specifically, an SIM is positioned in front of the transmit antenna for transmitting visual semantic information of complex scenes via imaging on the uniform planar array at the receiver. Furthermore, the simple scene description that contains textual semantic information is transmitted via amplitude-phase modulation over electromagnetic waves. To simultaneously transmit multi-modal information, we optimize the amplitude and phase of meta-atoms in the SIM using a customized gradient descent algorithm. The optimization aims to gradually minimize the mean squared error between the normalized energy distribution on the receiver array and the desired pattern corresponding to the visual semantic information. By combining the textual and visual semantic information, a conditional generative adversarial network is used to recover the complex scene accurately. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal SemCom system in reducing bandwidth overhead as well as the capability of the SIM for imaging the complex scene.

Title: Style-based Composer Identification and Attribution of Symbolic Music Scores: a Systematic Survey
Authors: Federico Simonetta
Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires, computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies, fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

Title: AI Flow: Perspectives, Scenarios, and Approaches
Authors: Hongjun An, Sida Huang, Siqi Huang, Ruanjun Li, Yuanzhi Liang, Jiawei Shao, Zihan Wang, Cheng Yuan, Chi Zhang, Hongyuan Zhang, Wenhao Zhuang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.

Title: Quantizing Small-Scale State-Space Models for Edge AI
Authors: Leo Zhao, Tristan Torchet, Melika Payvand, Laura Kriener, Filippo Moro
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently gained attention in deep learning for their ability to efficiently model long-range dependencies, making them promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining task performance. Using the S4D architecture, we first investigate post-training quantization (PTQ) and show that the state matrix A and internal state x are particularly sensitive to quantization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture. To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization (PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability. Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in resource-constrained environments.

Title: Exploring Audio Cues for Enhanced Test-Time Video Model Adaptation
Authors: Runhao Zeng, Qi Deng, Ronghao Zhang, Shuaicheng Niu, Jian Chen, Xiping Hu, Victor C. M. Leung
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves adaptation performance across different video classification models and represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into video TTA.

Title: Automated Heuristic Design for Unit Commitment Using Large Language Models
Authors: Junjin Lv, Chenggang Cui, Shaodi Zhang, Hui Chen, Chunyang Gong, Jiaming Liu
Abstract: The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving the UC problem.

Title: Inference-Time Gaze Refinement for Micro-Expression Recognition: Enhancing Event-Based Eye Tracking with Motion-Aware Post-Processing
Authors: Nuwan Bandara, Thivya Kandappu, Archan Misra
Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

Title: Speech-Language Models with Decoupled Tokenizers and Multi-Token Prediction

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of key components (i.e., speech tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling) on the performance of LLM-centric SLMs. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

Title: StreamMel: Real-Time Zero-shot Text-to-Speech via Interleaved Continuous Autoregressive Modeling
Authors: Hui Wang, Yifan Yang, Shujie Liu, Jinyu Li, Lingwei Meng, Yanqing Liu, Jiaming Zhou, Haoqin Sun, Yan Lu, Yong Qin
Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have achieved high-quality speech generation for unseen speakers, but most systems remain unsuitable for real-time applications because of their offline design. Current streaming TTS paradigms often rely on multi-stage pipelines and discrete representations, leading to increased computational cost and suboptimal system performance. In this work, we propose StreamMel, a pioneering single-stage streaming TTS framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms. By interleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, StreamMel enables low-latency, autoregressive synthesis while preserving high speaker similarity and naturalness. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that StreamMel outperforms existing streaming TTS baselines in both quality and latency. It even achieves performance comparable to offline systems while supporting efficient real-time generation, showcasing broad prospects for integration with real-time speech large language models.

Title: Video-Guided Text-to-Music Generation Using Public Domain Movie Collections
Authors: Haven Kim, Zachary Novack, Weihan Xu, Julian McAuley, Hao-Wen Dong
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music for a scene. This limitation primarily stems from the absence of comprehensive datasets that integrate these elements. To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre.

Title: Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective
Authors: Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.

Title: Behavioral Generative Agents for Energy Operations
Authors: Cong Chen, Omer Karaduman, Xu Kuang
Abstract: Accurately modeling consumer behavior in energy operations remains challenging due to inherent uncertainties, behavioral complexities, and limited empirical data. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging generative agents--artificial agents powered by large language models--to realistically simulate customer decision-making in dynamic energy operations. We demonstrate that these agents behave more optimally and rationally in simpler market scenarios, while their performance becomes more variable and suboptimal as task complexity rises. Furthermore, the agents exhibit heterogeneous customer preferences, consistently maintaining distinct, persona-driven reasoning patterns. Our findings highlight the potential value of integrating generative agents into energy management simulations to improve the design and effectiveness of energy policies and incentive programs.

Title: ANIRA: An Architecture for Neural Network Inference in Real-Time Audio Applications
Authors: Valentin Ackva, Fares Schulz
Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher incidence of real-time violations.

Title: SIC-Free Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Constellation-Constrained Optimization and Application to Large-Scale Systems
Authors: Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx, David Vargas
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems, SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate and MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a viable option for future implementations.

Title: SC-SOT: Conditioning the Decoder on Diarized Speaker Information for End-to-End Overlapped Speech Recognition
Authors: Yuta Hirano, Sakriani Sakti
Abstract: We propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT), an enhanced SOT-based training for E2E multi-talker ASR. We first probe how SOT handles overlapped speech, and we found the decoder performs implicit speaker separation. We hypothesize this implicit separation is often insufficient due to ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapping regions. To address this, SC-SOT explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, providing detailed information about "who spoke when". Specifically, we enhance the decoder by incorporating: (1) speaker embeddings, which allow the model to focus on the acoustic characteristics of the target speaker, and (2) speaker activity information, which guides the model to suppress non-target speakers. The speaker embeddings are derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization model, mitigating the need for speaker enrollment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach on overlapped speech.

Title: Spatially Consistent Air-to-Ground Channel Modeling with Probabilistic LOS/NLOS Segmentation
Authors: Evgenii Vinogradov, Abdul Saboor, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Aymen Fakhreddine
Abstract: In this paper, we present a spatially consistent A2G channel model based on probabilistic LOS/NLOS segmentation to parameterize the deterministic path loss and stochastic shadow fading model. Motivated by the limitations of existing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) channel models that overlook spatial correlation, our approach reproduces LOS/NLOS transitions along ground user trajectories in urban environments. This model captures environment-specific obstructions by means of azimuth and elevation-dependent LOS probabilities without requiring a full detailed 3D representation of the surroundings. We validate our framework against a geometry-based simulator by evaluating it across various urban settings. The results demonstrate its accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling further realistic derivations of path loss and shadow fading models and thorough outage analysis.

Title: Federated Neuroevolution O-RAN: Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning xApps
Authors: Mohammadreza Kouchaki, Aly Sabri Abdalla, Vuk Marojevic
Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture introduces RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate the management and optimization of the disaggregated RAN. Reinforcement learning (RL) and its advanced form, deep RL (DRL), are increasingly employed for designing intelligent controllers, or xApps, to be deployed in the near-real time (near-RT) RIC. These models often encounter local optima, which raise concerns about their reliability for RAN intelligent control. We therefore introduce Federated O-RAN enabled Neuroevolution (NE)-enhanced DRL (F-ONRL) that deploys an NE-based optimizer xApp in parallel to the RAN controller xApps. This NE-DRL xApp framework enables effective exploration and exploitation in the near-RT RIC without disrupting RAN operations. We implement the NE xApp along with a DRL xApp and deploy them on Open AI Cellular (OAIC) platform and present numerical results that demonstrate the improved robustness of xApps while effectively balancing the additional computational load.

Title: KCLNet: Physics-Informed Power Flow Prediction via Constraints Projections
Authors: Pantelis Dogoulis, Karim Tit, Maxime Cordy
Abstract: In the modern context of power systems, rapid, scalable, and physically plausible power flow predictions are essential for ensuring the grid's safe and efficient operation. While traditional numerical methods have proven robust, they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however, they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work, we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations, thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.

Title: SoundMind: RL-Incentivized Logic Reasoning for Audio-Language Models
Authors: Xingjian Diao, Chunhui Zhang, Keyi Kong, Weiyi Wu, Chiyu Ma, Zhongyu Ouyang, Peijun Qing, Soroush Vosoughi, Jiang Gui
Abstract: While large language models have shown reasoning capabilities, their application to the audio modality, particularly in large audio-language models (ALMs), remains significantly underdeveloped. Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in language models. Our code and the proposed dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Personalizable Long-Context Symbolic Music Infilling with MIDI-RWKV
Authors: Christian Zhou-Zheng, Philippe Pasquier
Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations. However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at this https URL.

Title: Counterexample-Guided Synthesis of Robust Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Erfan Shakhesi, Alexander Katriniok, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained popularity for training candidate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to satisfy the CBF conditions on a finite set of sampled states. However, since the CBF is unknown a priori, it is unclear which sampled states belong to its zero-superlevel set and must satisfy the CBF conditions, and which ones lie outside it. Existing approaches define a set in which all sampled states are required to satisfy the CBF conditions, thus introducing conservatism. In this paper, we address this issue for robust discrete-time CBFs (R-DTCBFs). Furthermore, we propose a class of R-DTCBFs that can be used in an online optimization problem to synthesize safe controllers for general discrete-time systems with input constraints and bounded disturbances. To train such an R-DTCBF that is valid not only on sampled states but also across the entire region, we employ a verification algorithm iteratively in a counterexample-guided approach. We apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.

Title: I$^2$S-TFCKD: Intra-Inter Set Knowledge Distillation with Time-Frequency Calibration for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Jiaming Cheng, Ruiyu Liang, Chao Xu, Ye Ni, Wei Zhou, Björn W. Schuller, Xiaoshuai Hao
Abstract: In recent years, complexity compression of neural network (NN)-based speech enhancement (SE) models has gradually attracted the attention of researchers, especially in scenarios with limited hardware resources or strict latency requirements. The main difficulties and challenges lie in achieving a balance between complexity and performance according to the characteristics of the task. In this paper, we propose an intra-inter set knowledge distillation (KD) framework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$S-TFCKD) for SE. Different from previous distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes the time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global knowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation based on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the teacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency domains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined allocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to speech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation paradigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set, multi-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated distillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each correlated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that enables inter-set knowledge interaction. The proposed distillation strategy is applied to the dual-path dilated convolutional recurrent network (DPDCRN) that ranked first in the SE track of the L3DAS23 challenge. Objective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed KD strategy consistently and effectively improves the performance of the low-complexity student model and outperforms other distillation schemes.

Title: Lightweight Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Empowered by Large-Scale AI Models
Authors: Chuanhong Liu, Caili Guo, Yang Yang, Mingzhe Chen, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence (LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities. However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements.

Authors: Wenchao Liu, Xuhui Zhang, Chunjie Wang, Jinke Ren, Weijie Yuan
Abstract: With the rapid development of low-altitude applications, there is an increasing demand for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) to simultaneously achieve high-rate communication, precise sensing, and reliable control in the low-altitude airspace. In this paper, we first present a typical system architecture of LAWNs, which integrates three core functionalities: communication, sensing, and control. Subsequently, we explore the promising prospects of movable antenna (MA)-assisted wireless communications, with emphasis on its potential in flexible beamforming, interference management, and spatial multiplexing gain. Furthermore, we elaborate on the integrated communication, sensing, and control capabilities enabled by MAs in LAWNs, and illustrate their effectiveness through representative examples. A case study demonstrates that MA-enabled LAWNs achieve significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-position antenna-based LAWNs in terms of communication throughput, sensing accuracy, and control stability. Finally, we outline several promising directions for future research, including the MA-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication/sensing, the MA-assisted reliable control, and the MA-enhanced physical layer security.

Abstract: The explosive growth of teletraffic, fueled by the convergence of cyber-physical systems and data-intensive applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous systems, and immersive communications, demands a multidisciplinary suite of innovative solutions across the physical and network layers. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) represent a transformative advancement in antenna design, offering enhanced spatial degrees of freedom through dynamic reconfigurability. By exploiting spatial flexibility, FAS can adapt to varying channel conditions and optimize wireless performance, making it a highly promising candidate for next-generation communication networks. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in FAS research. We begin by examining key application scenarios in which FAS offers significant advantages. We then present the fundamental principles of FAS, covering channel measurement and modeling, single-user configurations, and the multi-user fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) framework. Following this, we delve into key network-layer techniques such as quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, power allocation, and content placement strategies. We conclude by identifying prevailing challenges and outlining future research directions to support the continued development of FAS in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Bi-directional Context-Enhanced Speech Large Language Models for Multilingual Conversational ASR
Authors: Yizhou Peng, Hexin Liu, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: This paper introduces the integration of language-specific bi-directional context into a speech large language model (SLLM) to improve multilingual continuous conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a character-level contextual masking strategy during training, which randomly removes portions of the context to enhance robustness and better emulate the flawed transcriptions that may occur during inference. For decoding, a two-stage pipeline is utilized: initial isolated segment decoding followed by context-aware re-decoding using neighboring hypotheses. Evaluated on the 1500-hour Multilingual Conversational Speech and Language Model (MLC-SLM) corpus covering eleven languages, our method achieves an 18% relative improvement compared to a strong baseline, outperforming even the model trained on 6000 hours of data for the MLC-SLM competition. These results underscore the significant benefit of incorporating contextual information in multilingual continuous conversational ASR.

Title: Delayed Expansion AGT: Kinodynamic Planning with Application to Tractor-Trailer Parking
Authors: Dongliang Zheng, Yebin Wang, Stefano Di Cairano, Panagiotis Tsiotras
Abstract: Kinodynamic planning of articulated vehicles in cluttered environments faces additional challenges arising from high-dimensional state space and complex system dynamics. Built upon [1],[2], this work proposes the DE-AGT algorithm that grows a tree using pre-computed motion primitives (MPs) and A* heuristics. The first feature of DE-AGT is a delayed expansion of MPs. In particular, the MPs are divided into different modes, which are ranked online. With the MP classification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of MPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster. To obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we rely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate cost-to-go prediction. The learned heuristic is used for online mode ranking and node selection. Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching. Exactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking with the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming for articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this challenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller with the search process. DE-AGT is implemented for autonomous parking of a general car-like tractor with 3-trailer. Simulation results show an average of 10x acceleration compared to a previous method.

Title: Overcoming Occlusions in the Wild: A Multi-Task Age Head Approach to Age Estimation
Authors: Waqar Tanveer, Laura Fernández-Robles, Eduardo Fidalgo, Víctor González-Castro, Enrique Alegre
Abstract: Facial age estimation has achieved considerable success under controlled conditions. However, in unconstrained real-world scenarios, which are often referred to as 'in the wild', age estimation remains challenging, especially when faces are partially occluded, which may obscure their visibility. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach integrating generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer architectures to enable robust age estimation from occluded faces. We employ an SN-Patch GAN to effectively remove occlusions, while an Attentive Residual Convolution Module (ARCM), paired with a Swin Transformer, enhances feature representation. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Task Age Head (MTAH) that combines regression and distribution learning, further improving age estimation under occlusion. Experimental results on the FG-NET, UTKFace, and MORPH datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques for occluded facial age estimation by achieving an MAE of $3.00$, $4.54$, and $2.53$ years, respectively.

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

Title: Persistent Homology of Music Network with Three Different Distances
Authors: Eunwoo Heo, Byeongchan Choi, Myung ock Kim, Mai Lan Tran, Jae-Hun Jung
Abstract: Persistent homology has been widely used to discover hidden topological structures in data across various applications, including music data. To apply persistent homology, a distance or metric must be defined between points in a point cloud or between nodes in a graph network. These definitions are not unique and depend on the specific objectives of a given problem. In other words, selecting different metric definitions allows for multiple topological inferences. In this work, we focus on applying persistent homology to music graph with predefined weights. We examine three distinct distance definitions based on edge-wise pathways and demonstrate how these definitions affect persistent barcodes, persistence diagrams, and birth/death edges. We found that there exist inclusion relations in one-dimensional persistent homology reflected on persistence barcode and diagram among these three distance definitions. We verified these findings using real music data.

Title: Stream-Omni: Simultaneous Multimodal Interactions with Large Language-Vision-Speech Model
Authors: Shaolei Zhang, Shoutao Guo, Qingkai Fang, Yan Zhou, Yang Feng
Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience.

Title: Modeling Barrett's Esophagus Progression using Geometric Variational Autoencoders
Authors: Vivien van Veldhuizen, Sharvaree Vadgama, Onno J. de Boer, Sybren Meijer, Erik J. Bekkers
Abstract: Early detection of Barrett's Esophagus (BE), the only known precursor to Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), is crucial for effectively preventing and treating esophageal cancer. In this work, we investigate the potential of geometric Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn a meaningful latent representation that captures the progression of BE. We show that hyperspherical VAE (S-VAE) and Kendall Shape VAE show improved classification accuracy, reconstruction loss, and generative capacity. Additionally, we present a novel autoencoder architecture that can generate qualitative images without the need for a variational framework while retaining the benefits of an autoencoder, such as improved stability and reconstruction quality.

Title: Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping
Authors: Shingo Takemoto, Kazuki Naganuma, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV) is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the spatio-spectral piecewise smoothness. However, since SSTV refers only to the local differences of pixels/bands, edges and textures that extend beyond adjacent pixels are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, which is designed to preserve two essential physical characteristics of HS images: semi-local spatial structures and spectral correlation across all bands. Specifically, we define S3TTV as the sum of the nuclear norms of spatio-spectral structure tensors, which are matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors within semi-local areas. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a constrained convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.

Title: A robust and scalable framework for hallucination detection in virtual tissue staining and digital pathology
Authors: Luzhe Huang, Yuzhu Li, Nir Pillar, Tal Keidar Haran, William Dean Wallace, Aydogan Ozcan
Abstract: Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.

Title: Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled In-context Learning for Wireless Network Optimization: A Case Study of Power Control
Authors: Hao Zhou, Chengming Hu, Dun Yuan, Ye Yuan, Di Wu, Xue Liu, Charlie Zhang
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) has recently been considered a promising technique for many fields. This work explores LLM-based wireless network optimization via in-context learning. To showcase the potential of LLM technologies, we consider the base station (BS) power control as a case study, a fundamental but crucial technique that is widely investigated in wireless networks. Different from existing machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed in-context learning algorithm relies on LLM's inference capabilities. It avoids the complexity of tedious model training and hyper-parameter fine-tuning, which is a well-known bottleneck of many ML algorithms. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first describes the target task via formatted natural language, and then designs the in-context learning framework and demonstration examples. After that, it considers two cases, namely discrete-state and continuous-state problems, and proposes state-based and ranking-based methods to select appropriate examples for these two cases, respectively. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable performance as conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques without dedicated model training or fine-tuning. Such an efficient and low-complexity approach has great potential for future wireless network optimization.

Title: SMILE: Speech Meta In-Context Learning for Low-Resource Language Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Ming-Hao Hsu, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models demonstrate outstanding performance on high-resource languages but face significant challenges when applied to low-resource languages due to limited training data and insufficient cross-lingual generalization. Existing adaptation strategies, such as shallow fusion, data augmentation, and direct fine-tuning, either rely on external resources, suffer computational inefficiencies, or fail in test-time adaptation scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Speech Meta In-Context LEarning (SMILE), an innovative framework that combines meta-learning with speech in-context learning (SICL). SMILE leverages meta-training from high-resource languages to enable robust, few-shot generalization to low-resource languages without explicit fine-tuning on the target domain. Extensive experiments on the ML-SUPERB benchmark show that SMILE consistently outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing character and word error rates in training-free few-shot multilingual ASR tasks.

Title: Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images
Authors: Abhijeet Patil, Garima Jain, Harsh Diwakar, Jay Sawant, Tripti Bameta, Swapnil Rane, Amit Sethi
Abstract: We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at this https URL, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.

Title: Robust Tracking Control with Neural Network Dynamic Models under Input Perturbations
Authors: Huixuan Cheng, Hanjiang Hu, Changliu Liu
Abstract: Robust control problems have significant practical implications since external disturbances can significantly impact the performance of control methods. Existing robust control methods excel at control-affine systems but fail at neural network dynamic models. Developing robust control methods for such systems remains a complex challenge. In this paper, we focus on robust tracking methods for neural network dynamic models. We first propose a reachability analysis tool designed for this system and then introduce how to reformulate a robust tracking problem with reachable sets. In addition, we prove the existence of a feedback policy that bounds the growth of reachable sets over an infinite horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations of the tracking task, where we compare it with a standard tube MPC method.

Title: Distributed Attack-Resilient Platooning Against False Data Injection
Authors: Lorenzo Lyons, Manuel Boldrer, Laura Ferranti
Abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed vehicle platooning control and coordination strategy. We propose a distributed predecessor-follower CACC scheme that allows to choose an arbitrarily small inter-vehicle distance while guaranteeing no rear-end collisions occur, even in the presence of undetected cyber-attacks on the communication channels such as false data injection. The safety guarantees of the CACC policy are derived by combining a sensor-based ACC policy that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation, and a communication-based predictive term that has state-dependent limits on its control authority, thus containing the effects of an unreliable communication channel. An undetected attack may still however be able to degrade platooning performance. To mitigate it, we propose a tailored Kalman observer-based attack detection algorithm that initially triggers a switch from the CACC policy to the ACC policy. Subsequently, by relying on a high-level coordinator, our strategy allows to isolate a compromised vehicle from the platoon formation by reconfiguring the platoon topology itself. The coordinator can also handle merging and splitting requests. We compare our algorithm in an extensive simulation study against a state of the art distributed MPC scheme and a robust control scheme. We additionally extensively test our full method in practice on a real system, a team of scaled-down car-like robots. Furthermore, we share the code to run both the simulations and robotic experiments.

Title: Avoiding Deadlocks Is Not Enough: Analysis and Resolution of Blocked Airplanes
Authors: Shuhao Qi, Zengjie Zhang, Zhiyong Sun, Sofie Haesaert
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis and resolution of a pathological phenomenon in airplane encounters called blocking mode. As autonomy in airplane systems increases, a pathological phenomenon can be observed in two-aircraft encounter scenarios, where airplanes stick together and fly in parallel for an extended period. This parallel flight results in a temporary blocking that significantly delays progress. In contrast to widely studied deadlocks in multi-robot systems, such transient blocking is often overlooked in existing literature. Since such prolonged parallel flying places high-speed airplanes at elevated risks of near-miss collisions, encounter conflicts must be resolved as quickly as possible in the context of aviation. We develop a mathematical model for a two-airplane encounter system that replicates this blocking phenomenon. Using this model, we analyze the conditions under which blocking occurs, quantify the duration of the blocking period, and demonstrate that the blocking condition is significantly less restrictive than that of deadlock. Based on these analytical insights, we propose an intention-aware strategy with an adaptive priority mechanism that enables efficient resolution of ongoing blocking phenomena while also incidentally eliminating deadlocks. Notably, the developed strategy does not rely on central coordination and communications that can be unreliable in harsh situations. The analytical findings and the proposed resolution strategy are validated through extensive simulations.

Title: Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most
Authors: Yiming Fang, Li Chen, Yunfei Chen, Weidong Wang, Changsheng You
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.

Title: Channel Estimation for Hybrid MIMO Systems With Array Model Errors and Beam Squint Effects
Authors: Kabuto Arai, Koji Ishibashi
Abstract: This paper proposes a channel estimation method for hybrid wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems in high-frequency bands, including millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz), in the presence of beam squint effects and array errors arising from hardware impairments and environmental time fluctuations such as thermal effects and dynamic motion of the array. Although conventional channel estimation methods calibrate array errors through offline operation with large training pilots, the calibration errors remain due to time-varying array errors. Therefore, the proposed channel estimation method calibrates array errors online with small pilot overhead. In the proposed method, array response matrices are explicitly decomposed into a small number of physical parameters including path gains, angles and array errors, which are iteratively estimated by alternating optimization based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. To enhance the convergence performance, we introduce a switching mechanism from an ongrid algorithm to an off-gird algorithm depending on the estimation accuracy of the array error during algorithmic iterations. Furthermore, we introduce an approximate mutual coupling model to reduce the number of parameters. The reduction of parameters not only lowers computational complexity but also mitigates overfitting to noisy observations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively works online even with small pilot overhead in the presence of array errors.

Title: Probabilistic GOSPA: A Metric for Performance Evaluation of Multi-Object Filters with Uncertainties
Authors: Yuxuan Xia, Ángel F. García-Fernández, Johan Karlsson, Kuo-Chu Chang, Ting Yuan, Lennart Svensson
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic generalization of the Generalized Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (GOSPA) metric, termed P-GOSPA. The GOSPA metric has been widely used to evaluate the distance between finite sets, particularly in multi-object estimation applications. The P-GOSPA extends GOSPA into the space of multi-Bernoulli densities, incorporating inherent uncertainty in probabilistic multi-object representations. Additionally, P-GOSPA retains the interpretability of GOSPA, such as its decomposition into localization, missed detection, and false detection errors in a sound and meaningful manner. Examples and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed P-GOSPA metric.

Title: Learning Control for LQR with Unknown Packet Loss Rate Using Finite Channel Samples
Authors: Zhenning Zhang, Liang Xu, Yilin Mo, Xiaofan Wang
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem over an unknown Bernoulli packet loss channel. The unknown loss rate is estimated using finite channel samples and a certainty-equivalence (CE) optimal controller is then designed by treating the estimate as the true rate. The stabilizing capability and sub-optimality of the CE controller critically depend on the estimation error of loss rate. For discrete-time linear systems, we provide a stability threshold for the estimation error to ensure closed-loop stability, and analytically quantify the sub-optimality in terms of the estimation error and the difference in modified Riccati equations. Next, we derive the upper bound on sample complexity for the CE controller to be stabilizing. Tailored results with less conservatism are delivered for scalar systems and n-dimensional systems with invertible input matrix. Moreover, we establish a sufficient condition, independent of the unknown loss rate, to verify whether the CE controller is stabilizing in a probabilistic sense. Finally, numerical examples are used to validate our results.

Title: Physics-informed DeepCT: Sinogram Wavelet Decomposition Meets Masked Diffusion
Authors: Zekun Zhou, Tan Liu, Bing Yu, Yanru Gong, Liu Shi, Qiegen Liu
Abstract: Diffusion model shows remarkable potential on sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction. However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.

Title: A Novel Hybrid Precoder With Low-Resolution Phase Shifters and Fronthaul Capacity Limitation
Authors: Parisa Ramezani, Alva Kosasih, Emil Björnson
Abstract: In massive MIMO systems, fully digital precoding offers high performance but has significant implementation complexity and energy consumption, particularly at millimeter frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures provide a practical alternative by reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains while retaining performance in spatially sparse multipath scenarios. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which are impractical in real-world scenarios. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. To minimize the sum rate degradation caused by quantized analog and digital precoders, we propose novel designs inspired by the sphere decoding (SD) algorithm. We demonstrate numerically that our proposed designs outperform traditional methods, ensuring minimal sum rate loss in hybrid precoding systems with low-resolution phase shifters and limited fronthaul capacity.

Title: Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation
Authors: Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You
Abstract: The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.

Title: Noise Modulation over Wireless Energy Transfer: JEIH-Noise Mod
Authors: Erkin Yapici, Yusuf Islam Tek, Mehmet Ertug Pihtili, M. Cagri Ilter, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: This letter presents an innovative energy harvesting (EH) and communication scheme for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by utilizing the emerging noise modulation (Noise-Mod) technique. Our proposed approach embeds information into the mean value of real Gaussian noise samples, enabling simultaneous power transfer and data transmission. We analyze our system under the Rician fading channels with path loss and derive the bit error probability (BEP) expression. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional modulation schemes in terms of energy harvesting capability across various channel conditions. This scheme offers a novel solution by directly embedding data into the noise-modulated signal to enable information decoding through mean-based detection. Furthermore, it increases energy harvesting capability thanks to the utilized Gaussian waveform.

Title: Reducing Complexity of Data-Aided Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted Communications
Authors: Amarilton Lopes Magalhães, André Lima Férrer de Almeida, Gilderlan Tavares de Araújo
Abstract: We consider the data-aided channel estimation (CE) problem in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication system, where the channel and information symbols are estimated jointly during the CE phase, differently from pure pilot-aided methods. We propose a two-stage semi-blind receiver that jointly estimates the combined channel and the data symbols, followed by channel decoupling. To this end, we derive a new modeling framework whose first stage recasts the received signal to allow for the joint estimation of the combined channel and transmitted symbols. In the second stage, channel decoupling is easily achieved via Khatri-Rao factorization, yielding a refined channel estimate. Our solution yields accurate estimates of the cascaded channel at lower computational complexity. Simulation results reveal a similar performance of the proposed method to that of the competitor while providing a substantially reduced computational cost.

Title: Performance Modeling for Correlation-based Neural Decoding of Auditory Attention to Speech
Authors: Simon Geirnaert, Jonas Vanthornhout, Tom Francart, Alexander Bertrand
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.

Title: Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems
Authors: Katayoun Eshkofti, Matthieu Barreau
Abstract: In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.

Title: QualiSpeech: A Speech Quality Assessment Dataset with Natural Language Reasoning and Descriptions
Authors: Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Lu Lu, Yu Tsao, Junichi Yamagishi, Yuxuan Wang, Chao Zhang
Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at this https URL.

Title: Mixed Bernstein-Fourier Approximants for Optimal Trajectory Generation with Periodic Behavior
Authors: Liraz Mudrik, Sean Kragelund, Isaac Kaminer
Abstract: Efficient trajectory generation is critical for autonomous systems, yet current numerical methods often struggle to handle periodic behaviors effectively, especially when equidistant time nodes are required. This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.

Title: Improving Generalization in MRI-Based Deep Learning Models for Total Knee Replacement Prediction
Authors: Ehsan Karami, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Title: VIViT: Variable-Input Vision Transformer Framework for 3D MR Image Segmentation
Authors: Badhan Kumar Das, Ajay Singh, Gengyan Zhao, Han Liu, Thomas J. Re, Dorin Comaniciu, Eli Gibson, Andreas Maier
Abstract: Self-supervised pretrain techniques have been widely used to improve the downstream tasks' performance. However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR) studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study. With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain, and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively. These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.

Title: Leveraging AM and FM Rhythm Spectrograms for Dementia Classification and Assessment
Authors: Parismita Gogoi, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Seema Khadirnaikar, Soma Siddhartha, Sishir Kalita, Jagabandhu Mishra, Md Sahidullah, Priyankoo Sarmah, S. R. M. Prasanna
Abstract: This study explores the potential of Rhythm Formant Analysis (RFA) to capture long-term temporal modulations in dementia speech. Specifically, we introduce RFA-derived rhythm spectrograms as novel features for dementia classification and regression tasks. We propose two methodologies: (1) handcrafted features derived from rhythm spectrograms, and (2) a data-driven fusion approach, integrating proposed RFA-derived rhythm spectrograms with vision transformer (ViT) for acoustic representations along with BERT-based linguistic embeddings. We compare these with existing features. Notably, our handcrafted features outperform eGeMAPs with a relative improvement of $14.2\%$ in classification accuracy and comparable performance in the regression task. The fusion approach also shows improvement, with RFA spectrograms surpassing Mel spectrograms in classification by around a relative improvement of $13.1\%$ and a comparable regression score with the baselines.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of 74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows in clinical practice.

Title: Heart Rate Classification in ECG Signals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Authors: Thien Nhan Vo
Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception. Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Title: Real-Time High-Accuracy Digital Wireless Time, Frequency, and Phase Calibration For Coherent Distributed Antenna Arrays
Authors: Jason M. Merlo, Samuel Wagner, John Lancaster, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling radio frequency (RF) phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.

Title: Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook
Authors: Vivien van Veldhuizen, Vanessa Botha, Chunyao Lu, Melis Erdal Cesur, Kevin Groot Lipman, Edwin D. de Jong, Hugo Horlings, Clárisa I. Sanchez, Cees G. M. Snoek, Lodewyk Wessels, Ritse Mann, Eric Marcus, Jonas Teuwen
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

Title: Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration
Authors: George C. Alexandropoulos, Konstantinos D. Katsanos, Evangelos Vlachos
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.

Title: ADAgent: LLM Agent for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis with Collaborative Coordinator
Authors: Wenlong Hou, Guangqian Yang, Ye Du, Yeung Lau, Lihao Liu, Junjun He, Ling Long, Shujun Wang
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However, most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks, process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

Title: S2ST-Omni: An Efficient and Scalable Multilingual Speech-to-Speech Translation Framework via Seamlessly Speech-Text Alignment and Streaming Speech Decoder
Authors: Yu Pan, Yuguang Yang, Yanni Hu, Jianhao Ye, Xiang Zhang, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao
Abstract: Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert spoken utterances from multiple source languages into fluent and intelligible speech in a target language. Despite recent progress, several critical challenges persist: 1) achieving high-quality and low-latency S2ST remains a significant obstacle; 2) most existing S2ST methods rely heavily on large-scale parallel speech corpora, which are difficult and resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce S2ST-Omni, a novel, efficient, and scalable framework tailored for multilingual speech-to-speech translation. To enable high-quality S2TT while mitigating reliance on large-scale parallel speech corpora, we leverage powerful pretrained models: Whisper for robust audio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text comprehension. A lightweight speech adapter is introduced to bridge the modality gap between speech and text representations, facilitating effective utilization of pretrained multimodal knowledge. To ensure both translation accuracy and real-time responsiveness, we adopt a streaming speech decoder in the TTS stage, which generates the target speech in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments conducted on the CVSS benchmark demonstrate that S2ST-Omni consistently surpasses several state-of-the-art S2ST baselines in translation quality, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Title: Is Smaller Always Faster? Tradeoffs in Compressing Self-Supervised Speech Transformers
Authors: Tzu-Quan Lin, Tsung-Huan Yang, Chun-Yao Chang, Kuang-Ming Chen, Tzu-hsun Feng, Hung-yi Lee, Hao Tang
Abstract: Transformer-based self-supervised models have achieved remarkable success in speech processing, but their large size and high inference cost present significant challenges for real-world deployment. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed, inconsistent evaluation metrics make it difficult to compare their practical effectiveness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of four common compression methods, including weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers. We evaluate each method under three key metrics: parameter count, multiply-accumulate operations, and real-time factor. Results show that each method offers distinct advantages. In addition, we contextualize recent compression techniques, comparing DistilHuBERT, FitHuBERT, LightHuBERT, ARMHuBERT, and STaRHuBERT under the same framework, offering practical guidance on compression for deployment.

Title: Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions
Authors: Shimin Wang, Martin Guay, Denis Dochain
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.

Title: On the Degrees of Freedom and Eigenfunctions of Line-of-Sight Holographic MIMO Communications
Authors: Juan Carlos Ruiz-Sicilia, Marco Di Renzo, Marco Donald Migliore, Merouane Debbah, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: We consider a line-of-sight communication link between two holographic surfaces (HoloSs), and provide a closed-form expression for the effective degrees of freedom (eDoF), i.e., the number of orthogonal communication modes that can be established between them. The proposed framework can be applied to network deployments beyond the widely studied paraxial setting. This is obtained by partitioning the largest HoloS into sub-HoloSs, and proving that the supports of the Fourier transforms of the kernels of the obtained integral operators are limited and are almost disjoint in the wavenumber domain, provided that the sub-HoloSs are sufficiently small. Using the proposed approach, it is proved that (i) the eDoF correspond to an instance of Landau's second eigenvalue problem; (ii) the eigenvalues polarize asymptotically to multiple values; and (iii) the eDoF depend explicitly on the approximation accuracy according to Kolmogorov's n-width criterion. This result generalizes the analysis in the paraxial setting, in which it is known that the eigenvalues polarize asymptotically to two values. In addition, it is proved that the typical method of analysis utilized in the paraxial setting, which is based on a parabolic approximation of the wavefront in a local coordinates system, is equivalent to a quartic approximation of the wavefront in a general coordinates system. This facilitates the derivation of an explicit formula for the eDoF in terms of key system parameters, including the relative offset between the center-points of the HoloSs, and their relative rotation and tilt. We specialize the framework to canonical network deployments, and provide analytical expressions for the optimal, according to Kolmogorov's n-width criterion, basis functions (communication waveforms) for data encoding and decoding.

Title: Directional Source Separation for Robust Speech Recognition on Smart Glasses
Authors: Tiantian Feng, Ju Lin, Yiteng Huang, Weipeng He, Kaustubh Kalgaonkar, Niko Moritz, Li Wan, Xin Lei, Ming Sun, Frank Seide
Abstract: Modern smart glasses leverage advanced audio sensing and machine learning technologies to offer real-time transcribing and captioning services, considerably enriching human experiences in daily communications. However, such systems frequently encounter challenges related to environmental noises, resulting in degradation to speech recognition and speaker change detection. To improve voice quality, this work investigates directional source separation using the multi-microphone array. We first explore multiple beamformers to assist source separation modeling by strengthening the directional properties of speech signals. In addition to relying on predetermined beamformers, we investigate neural beamforming in multi-channel source separation, demonstrating that automatic learning directional characteristics effectively improves separation quality. We further compare the ASR performance leveraging separated outputs to noisy inputs. Our results show that directional source separation benefits ASR for the wearer but not for the conversation partner. Lastly, we perform the joint training of the directional source separation and ASR model, achieving the best overall ASR performance.

Title: Stochasticity-aware No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment
Authors: Songlin Fan, Wei Gao, Zhineng Chen, Ge Li, Guoqing Liu, Qicheng Wang
Abstract: The evolution of point cloud processing algorithms necessitates an accurate assessment for their quality. Previous works consistently regard point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) as a MOS regression problem and devise a deterministic mapping, ignoring the stochasticity in generating MOS from subjective tests. This work presents the first probabilistic architecture for no-reference PCQA, motivated by the labeling process of existing datasets. The proposed method can model the quality judging stochasticity of subjects through a tailored conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and produces multiple intermediate quality ratings. These intermediate ratings simulate the judgments from different subjects and are then integrated into an accurate quality prediction, mimicking the generation process of a ground truth MOS. Specifically, our method incorporates a Prior Module, a Posterior Module, and a Quality Rating Generator, where the former two modules are introduced to model the judging stochasticity in subjective tests, while the latter is developed to generate diverse quality ratings. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous cutting-edge methods by a large margin and exhibits gratifying cross-dataset robustness. Codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Two-Phase Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam Split
Authors: Xin Su, Ruisi He, Peng Zhang, Bo Ai, Yong Niu, Gongpu Wang
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a key technology to support ultra-high data rates in future sixth-generation networks. However, the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) in such systems is challenging due to the passive nature of RIS and the hybrid beamforming architecture typically employed in THz systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel low-complexity two-phase channel estimation scheme for RIS-assisted THz systems with beam split effect. In the proposed scheme, we first estimate the full CSI over a small subset of subcarriers, then extract angular information at both the base station and RIS. Subsequently, we recover the full CSI across remaining subcarriers by determining the corresponding spatial directions and angle-excluded coefficients. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square error while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to existing algorithms.

Title: Revisiting XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: When Dual-Wideband Effects Meet Near Field
Authors: Anzheng Tang, Jun-Bo Wang, Yijin Pan, Tuo Wu, Yijian Chen, Hongkang Yu, Maged Elkashlan
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and operation at higher frequency bands in wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduce significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. Combined with dual-wideband impacts, these effects fundamentally reshape the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, making existing sparsity-based channel estimation methods inadequate. To address these challenges, this paper revisits the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems, considering dual-wideband effects, spherical wavefront, and SnS properties. By leveraging the spatial-chirp property of near-field array responses, we quantitatively characterize the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, revealing global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. Building on this structured sparsity, we formulate the wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference task and propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model to effectively capture the sparsity characteristics. To enable efficient channel reconstruction, we develop an MMV-based variational message passing (MMV-VMP) algorithm, tailored to the complex factor graph induced by the hierarchical prior. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its convergence and superior performance compared to existing methods, thus establishing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation under complex near-field conditions.

Title: Fast Point Cloud Geometry Compression with Context-based Residual Coding and INR-based Refinement
Authors: Hao Xu, Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu
Abstract: Compressing a set of unordered points is far more challenging than compressing images/videos of regular sample grids, because of the difficulties in characterizing neighboring relations in an irregular layout of points. Many researchers resort to voxelization to introduce regularity, but this approach suffers from quantization loss. In this research, we use the KNN method to determine the neighborhoods of raw surface points. This gives us a means to determine the spatial context in which the latent features of 3D points are compressed by arithmetic coding. As such, the conditional probability model is adaptive to local geometry, leading to significant rate reduction. Additionally, we propose a dual-layer architecture where a non-learning base layer reconstructs the main structures of the point cloud at low complexity, while a learned refinement layer focuses on preserving fine details. This design leads to reductions in model complexity and coding latency by two orders of magnitude compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR) into the refinement layer, allowing the decoder to sample points on the underlying surface at arbitrary densities. This work is the first to effectively exploit content-aware local contexts for compressing irregular raw point clouds, achieving high rate-distortion performance, low complexity, and the ability to function as an arbitrary-scale upsampling network simultaneously.

Title: Melody predominates over harmony in the evolution of musical scales across 96 countries
Authors: John M McBride, Elizabeth Phillips, Patrick E Savage, Steven Brown, Tsvi Tlusty
Abstract: The standard theory of musical scales since antiquity has been based on harmony, rather than melody. While recent analyses provide mixed support for a role of melody as well as harmony, we lack a comparative analysis based on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding problem through a rigorous computational comparison of the main theories using 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for melodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts for the prevalence of certain simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for music-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their dominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony is a poor predictor of scales measured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia. Overall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that melody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.

Title: On the Feasibility of Fully AI-automated Vishing Attacks
Authors: João Figueiredo, Afonso Carvalho, Daniel Castro, Daniel Gonçalves, Nuno Santos
Abstract: A vishing attack is a form of social engineering where attackers use phone calls to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information, such as personal data, financial information, or security credentials. Attackers exploit the perceived urgency and authenticity of voice communication to manipulate victims, often posing as legitimate entities like banks or tech support. Vishing is a particularly serious threat as it bypasses security controls designed to protect information. In this work, we study the potential for vishing attacks to escalate with the advent of AI. In theory, AI-powered software bots may have the ability to automate these attacks by initiating conversations with potential victims via phone calls and deceiving them into disclosing sensitive information. To validate this thesis, we introduce ViKing, an AI-powered vishing system developed using publicly available AI technology. It relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core cognitive processor to steer conversations with victims, complemented by a pipeline of speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules that facilitate audio-text conversion in phone calls. Through a controlled social experiment involving 240 participants, we discovered that ViKing has successfully persuaded many participants to reveal sensitive information, even those who had been explicitly warned about the risk of vishing campaigns. Interactions with ViKing's bots were generally considered realistic. From these findings, we conclude that tools like ViKing may already be accessible to potential malicious actors, while also serving as an invaluable resource for cyber awareness programs.

Title: Generating Symbolic Music from Natural Language Prompts using an LLM-Enhanced Dataset
Authors: Weihan Xu, Julian McAuley, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Shlomo Dubnov, Hao-Wen Dong
Abstract: Recent years have seen many audio-domain text-to-music generation models that rely on large amounts of text-audio pairs for training. However, symbolic-domain controllable music generation has lagged behind partly due to the lack of a large-scale symbolic music dataset with extensive metadata and captions. In this work, we present MetaScore, a new dataset consisting of 963K musical scores paired with rich metadata, including free-form user-annotated tags, collected from an online music forum. To approach text-to-music generation, We employ a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate pseudo-natural language captions for music from its metadata tags. With the LLM-enhanced MetaScore, we train a text-conditioned music generation model that learns to generate symbolic music from the pseudo captions, allowing control of instruments, genre, composer, complexity and other free-form music descriptors. In addition, we train a tag-conditioned system that supports a predefined set of tags available in MetaScore. Our experimental results show that both the proposed text-to-music and tags-to-music models outperform a baseline text-to-music model in a listening test. While a concurrent work Text2MIDI also supports free-form text input, our models achieve comparable performance. Moreover, the text-to-music system offers a more natural interface than the tags-to-music model, as it allows users to provide free-form natural language prompts.

Title: Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Derek Fan, David A. Copp
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.

Title: Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Chemical Reaction Networks Using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
Authors: Adittya Pal, Rolf Fagerberg, Jakob Lykke Andersen, Christoph Flamm, Peter Dittrich, Daniel Merkle
Abstract: The search for pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.

Title: Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity
Authors: Tianqi Shen, Shaohua Liu, Jiaqi Feng, Ziye Ma, Ning An
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.

Title: A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling
Authors: Lintao Li, Wei Chen
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.

Title: Benchmarking Rotary Position Embeddings for Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Shucong Zhang, Titouan Parcollet, Rogier van Dalen, Sourav Bhattacharya
Abstract: Self-attention relies on positional embeddings to encode input order. Relative Position (RelPos) embeddings are widely used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, RelPos has quadratic time complexity to input length and is often incompatible with fast GPU implementations of attention. In contrast, Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) rotates each input vector based on its absolute position, taking linear time to sequence length, implicitly encoding relative distances through self-attention dot products. Thus, it is usually compatible with efficient attention. However, its use in ASR remains underexplored. This work evaluates RoPE across diverse ASR tasks with training data ranging from 100 to 50,000 hours, covering various speech types (read, spontaneous, clean, noisy) and different accents in both streaming and non-streaming settings. ASR error rates are similar or better than RelPos, while training time is reduced by up to 21%. Code is available via the SpeechBrain toolkit.

Title: Bounding the Settling Time of Finite-Time Stable Systems using Sum of Squares
Authors: Sengiyumva Kisole, Kunal Garg, Matthew Peet
Abstract: Finite-time stability (FTS) of a differential equation guarantees that solutions reach a given equilibrium point in finite time, where the time of convergence depends on the initial state of the system. For traditional stability notions such as exponential stability, the convex optimization framework of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) enables computation of polynomial Lyapunov functions to certify stability. However, finite-time stable systems are characterized by non-Lipschitz, non-polynomial vector fields, rendering standard SoS methods inapplicable. To this end, we show that computation of a non-polynomial Lyapunov function certifying finite-time stability can be reformulated as feasibility of a set of polynomial inequalities under a particular transformation. As a result, SoS can be utilized to verify FTS and obtain a bound on the settling time. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the conditions in both certifying finite-time stability and bounding the settling time.

Title: HSRMamba: Contextual Spatial-Spectral State Space Model for Single Image Hyperspectral Super-Resolution
Authors: Shi Chen, Lefei Zhang, Liangpei Zhang
Abstract: Mamba has demonstrated exceptional performance in visual tasks due to its powerful global modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, offering considerable potential in hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSISR). However, in HSISR, Mamba faces challenges as transforming images into 1D sequences neglects the spatial-spectral structural relationships between locally adjacent pixels, and its performance is highly sensitive to input order, which affects the restoration of both spatial and spectral details. In this paper, we propose HSRMamba, a contextual spatial-spectral modeling state space model for HSISR, to address these issues both locally and globally. Specifically, a local spatial-spectral partitioning mechanism is designed to establish patch-wise causal relationships among adjacent pixels in 3D features, mitigating the local forgetting issue. Furthermore, a global spectral reordering strategy based on spectral similarity is employed to enhance the causal representation of similar pixels across both spatial and spectral dimensions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate our HSRMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative quality and visual results. Code is available at: this https URL.

Title: MTLM: Incorporating Bidirectional Text Information to Enhance Language Model Training in Speech Recognition Systems
Authors: Qingliang Meng, Pengju Ren, Tian Li, Changsong Dai, Huizhi Liang
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems normally consist of an acoustic model (AM) and a language model (LM). The acoustic model estimates the probability distribution of text given the input speech, while the language model calibrates this distribution toward a specific knowledge domain to produce the final transcription. Traditional ASR-specific LMs are typically trained in a unidirectional (left-to-right) manner to align with autoregressive decoding. However, this restricts the model from leveraging the right-side context during training, limiting its representational capacity. In this work, we propose MTLM, a novel training paradigm that unifies unidirectional and bidirectional manners through 3 training objectives: ULM, BMLM, and UMLM. This approach enhances the LM's ability to capture richer linguistic patterns from both left and right contexts while preserving compatibility with standard ASR autoregressive decoding methods. As a result, the MTLM model not only enhances the ASR system's performance but also support multiple decoding strategies, including shallow fusion, unidirectional/bidirectional n-best rescoring. Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset show that MTLM consistently outperforms unidirectional training across multiple decoding strategies, highlighting its effectiveness and flexibility in ASR applications.

Title: Object State Estimation Through Robotic Active Interaction for Biological Autonomous Drilling
Authors: Xiaofeng Lin, Enduo Zhao, Saúl Alexis Heredia Pérez, Kanako Harada
Abstract: Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.

Title: CONQURE: A Co-Execution Environment for Quantum and Classical Resources
Authors: Atulya Mahesh, Swastik Mittal, Frank Mueller
Abstract: Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.

Title: Reliable Vertical Federated Learning in 5G Core Network Architecture
Authors: Mohamad Mestoukirdi, Mourad Khanfouci
Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

Title: Leveraging LLM and Self-Supervised Training Models for Speech Recognition in Chinese Dialects: A Comparative Analysis
Authors: Tianyi Xu, Hongjie Chen, Wang Qing, Lv Hang, Jian Kang, Li Jie, Zhennan Lin, Yongxiang Li, Xie Lei
Abstract: Large-scale training corpora have significantly improved the performance of ASR models. Unfortunately, due to the relative scarcity of data, Chinese accents and dialects remain a challenge for most ASR models. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning have shown that self-supervised pre-training, combined with large language models (LLM), can effectively enhance ASR performance in low-resource scenarios. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of this paradigm for Chinese dialects. Specifically, we pre-train a Data2vec2 model on 300,000 hours of unlabeled dialect and accented speech data and do alignment training on a supervised dataset of 40,000 hours. Then, we systematically examine the impact of various projectors and LLMs on Mandarin, dialect, and accented speech recognition performance under this paradigm. Our method achieved SOTA results on multiple dialect datasets, including Kespeech. We will open-source our work to promote reproducible research

Title: Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight Architecture DDPM
Authors: Xun Li, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

Title: Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control
Authors: Ruitao Chen, Mozhang Guo, Jinge Li
Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Title: LeVo: High-Quality Song Generation with Multi-Preference Alignment
Authors: Shun Lei, Yaoxun Xu, Zhiwei Lin, Huaicheng Zhang, Wei Tan, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Yixuan Zhang, Chenyu Yang, Haina Zhu, Shuai Wang, Zhiyong Wu, Dong Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs.

Title: Incorporating Linguistic Constraints from External Knowledge Source for Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction
Authors: Wenxuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.

Title: Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic
Authors: Zahra Shahrooei, Ali Baheri
Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Title: Enabling On-Device Medical AI Assistants via Input-Driven Saliency Adaptation
Authors: Uttej Kallakurik, Edward Humes, Rithvik Jonna, Xiaomin Lin, Tinoosh Mohsenin
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Title: A Self-Refining Framework for Enhancing ASR Using TTS-Synthesized Data
Authors: Cheng-Kang Chou, Chan-Jan Hsu, Ho-Lam Chung, Liang-Hsuan Tseng, Hsi-Chun Cheng, Yu-Kuan Fu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung-Yi Lee
Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings.
