Title: Exploring Image Transforms derived from Eye Gaze Variables for Progressive Autism Diagnosis
Authors: Abigail Copiaco, Christian Ritz, Yassine Himeur, Valsamma Eapen, Ammar Albanna, Wathiq Mansoor
Abstract: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has surged rapidly over the past decade, posing significant challenges in communication, behavior, and focus for affected individuals. Current diagnostic techniques, though effective, are time-intensive, leading to high social and economic costs. This work introduces an AI-powered assistive technology designed to streamline ASD diagnosis and management, enhancing convenience for individuals with ASD and efficiency for caregivers and therapists. The system integrates transfer learning with image transforms derived from eye gaze variables to diagnose ASD. This facilitates and opens opportunities for in-home periodical diagnosis, reducing stress for individuals and caregivers, while also preserving user privacy through the use of image transforms. The accessibility of the proposed method also offers opportunities for improved communication between guardians and therapists, ensuring regular updates on progress and evolving support needs. Overall, the approach proposed in this work ensures timely, accessible diagnosis while protecting the subjects' privacy, improving outcomes for individuals with ASD.

Title: Foundation Models in Medical Imaging -- A Review and Outlook
Authors: Vivien van Veldhuizen, Vanessa Botha, Chunyao Lu, Melis Erdal Cesur, Kevin Groot Lipman, Edwin D. de Jong, Hugo Horlings, Clárisa Sanchez, Cees Snoek, Ritse Mann, Eric Marcus, Jonas Teuwen
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

Title: Low-Rank Augmented Implicit Neural Representation for Unsupervised High-Dimensional Quantitative MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Haonan Zhang, Guoyan Lao, Yuyao Zhang, Hongjiang Wei
Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps. Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

Title: An Explainable Deep Learning Framework for Brain Stroke and Tumor Progression via MRI Interpretation
Authors: Rajan Das Gupta, Md Imrul Hasan Showmick, Mushfiqur Rahman Abir, Shanjida Akter, Md. Yeasin Rahat, Md. Jakir Hossen
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages. We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation. The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\% and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.

Abstract: The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Lumbar Degenerative Imaging Spine Classification (LumbarDISC) dataset is the largest publicly available dataset of adult MRI lumbar spine examinations annotated for degenerative changes. The dataset includes 2,697 patients with a total of 8,593 image series from 8 institutions across 6 countries and 5 continents. The dataset is available for free for non-commercial use via Kaggle and RSNA Medical Imaging Resource of AI (MIRA). The dataset was created for the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition where competitors developed deep learning models to grade degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. The degree of spinal canal, subarticular recess, and neural foraminal stenosis was graded at each intervertebral disc level in the lumbar spine. The images were annotated by expert volunteer neuroradiologists and musculoskeletal radiologists from the RSNA, American Society of Neuroradiology, and the American Society of Spine Radiology. This dataset aims to facilitate research and development in machine learning and lumbar spine imaging to lead to improved patient care and clinical efficiency.

Title: Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry
Authors: James R. Williamson, Andrew Alini, Brian A. Telfer, Adam W. Potter, Karl E. Friedl
Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Title: Optimal Task Offloading with Firm Deadlines for Mobile Edge Computing Systems
Authors: Khai Doan, Wesley Araujo, Evangelos Kranakis, Ioannis Lambadaris, Yannis Viniotis, Wonjae Shin
Abstract: Under a dramatic increase in mobile data traffic, a promising solution for edge computing systems to maintain their local service is the task migration that may be implemented by means of Autonomous mobile agents (AMA). In designing an optimal scheme for task offloading to AMA, we define a system cost as a minimization objective function that comprises two parts. First, an offloading cost which can be interpreted as the cost of using computational resources from the AMA. Second, a penalty cost due to potential task expiration. To minimize the expected (timeaverage) cost over a given time horizon, we formulate a Dynamic programming (DP). However, the DP Equation suffers from the well-known curse of dimensionality, which makes computations intractable, especially for infinite system state space. To reduce the computational burden, we identify three important properties of the optimal policy and show that it suffices to evaluate the DP Equation on a finite subset of the state space only. We then prove that the optimal task offloading decision at a state can be inferred from that at its adjacent states, further reducing the computational load. We present simulations to verify the theoretical results and to provide insights into the considered system.

Title: Energy efficiency of DMAs vs. conventional MIMO: a sensitivity analysis
Authors: Pablo Ramírez-Espinosa, David Morales-Jiménez, Beatriz Soret
Abstract: Motivated by the stringent and challenging need for `greener communications' in increasingly power-hungry 5G networks, this paper presents a detailed energy efficiency analysis for three different multi-antenna architectures, namely fully-digital arrays, hybrid arrays, and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). By leveraging a circuital model, which captures mutual coupling, insertion losses, propagation through the waveguides in DMAs and other electromagnetic phenomena, we design a transmit Wiener filter solution for the three systems. We then use these results to analyze the energy efficiency, considering different consumption models and supplied power, and with particular focus on the impact of the physical phenomena. DMAs emerge as an efficient alternative to classical arrays across diverse tested scenarios, most notably under low transmission power, strong coupling, and scalability requirements.

Title: Not all those who drift are lost: Drift correction and calibration scheduling for the IoT
Authors: Aaron Hurst, Andrey V. Kalinichev, Klaus Koren, Daniel E. Lucani
Abstract: Sensors provide a vital source of data that link digital systems with the physical world. However, as sensors age, the relationship between what they measure and what they output changes. This is known as sensor drift and poses a significant challenge that, combined with limited opportunity for re-calibration, can severely limit data quality over time. Previous approaches to drift correction typically require large volumes of ground truth data and do not consider measurement or prediction uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic sensor drift correction method that takes a fundamental approach to modelling the sensor response using Gaussian Process Regression. Tested using dissolved oxygen sensors, our method delivers mean squared error (MSE) reductions of up to 90% and more than 20% on average. We also propose a novel uncertainty-driven calibration schedule optimisation approach that builds on top of drift correction and further reduces MSE by up to 15.7%.

Title: A Data-driven Predictive Control Architecture for Train Thermal Energy Management
Authors: Ahmed Aboudonia, Johannes Estermann, Keith Moffat, Manfred Morari, John Lygeros
Abstract: We aim to improve the energy efficiency of train climate control architectures, with a focus on a specific class of regional trains operating throughout Switzerland, especially in Zurich and Geneva. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represent the second largest energy consumer in these trains after traction. The current architecture comprises a high-level rule-based controller and a low-level tracking controller. To improve train energy efficiency, we propose adding a middle data-driven predictive control layer aimed at minimizing HVAC energy consumption while maintaining passenger comfort. The scheme incorporates a multistep prediction model developed using real-world data collected from a limited number of train coaches. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we conduct multiple experiments on a separate set of train coaches; our results suggest energy savings between 10% and 35% with respect to the current architecture.

Title: Integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding and Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Emirhan Bilgiç, Neslihan Serap Şengör, Namık Berk Yalabık, Yavuz Selim İşler, Aykut Görkem Gelen, Rahmi Elibol
Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN, showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an encoding mechanism.

Title: Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic for Dual-Objective Control of Multi-UAV Swarms
Authors: Haoran Peng, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives: maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently, an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

Title: Near-Field Sensing Enabled Predictive Beamforming: Fundamentals, Framework, and Opportunities
Authors: Hao Jiang, Zhaolin Wang, Yue Liu, Hyundong Shin, Arumugam Nallanathan, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The article proposes a novel near-field predictive beamforming framework for high-mobility wireless networks. Specifically, due to the spherical waves and non-uniform Doppler frequencies brought by the near-field region, the new ability of full-dimensional location and velocity sensing is characterized. Building on this foundation, the near-field predictive beamforming framework is proposed to proactively design beamformers for mobility users following arbitrary trajectories. Compared to the conventional far-field counterpart, the near-field predictive beamforming stands out due to: i) Prior-Knowledge-Free Prediction, and ii) Low-Complexity and Generalizable System Design. To realize these advantages, the implementation methods are discussed, followed by a case study confirming the benefits of the proposed framework. Finally, the article highlights promising research opportunities inspired by the proposed framework.

Title: Enhancing Acoustic-to-Articulatory Speech Inversion by Incorporating Nasality
Authors: Saba Tabatabaee, Suzanne Boyce, Liran Oren, Mark Tiede, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Speech is produced through the coordination of vocal tract constricting organs: lips, tongue, velum, and glottis. Previous works developed Speech Inversion (SI) systems to recover acoustic-to-articulatory mappings for lip and tongue constrictions, called oral tract variables (TVs), which were later enhanced by including source information (periodic and aperiodic energies, and F0 frequency) as proxies for glottal control. Comparison of the nasometric measures with high-speed nasopharyngoscopy showed that nasalance can serve as ground truth, and that an SI system trained with it reliably recovers velum movement patterns for American English speakers. Here, two SI training approaches are compared: baseline models that estimate oral TVs and nasalance independently, and a synergistic model that combines oral TVs and source features with nasalance. The synergistic model shows relative improvements of 5% in oral TVs estimation and 9% in nasalance estimation compared to the baseline models.

Title: Development of a Photon-Counting Deadtime Noise Model that Extends Dynamic Range and Resolution in Atmospheric Lidar
Authors: Grant J. Kirchhoff, Matthew Hayman, Willem J. Marais, Jeffrey P. Thayer, Rory A. Barton-Grimley
Abstract: This work derives and validates a noise model that encapsulates deadtime of non-paralyzable detectors with random photon arrivals to enable advanced processing, like maximum-likelihood estimation, of high resolution atmospheric lidar profiles while accounting for deadtime bias. This estimator was validated across a wide dynamic range at high resolution (4 millimeters in range, 17 milliseconds in time). Experiments demonstrate that the noise model outperforms the current state-of-the-art for very short time-of-flight (2 nanoseconds) and extended targets (1 microsecond). The proposed noise model also produces accurate deadtime correction for very short integration times. This work sets the foundation for further study into accurate retrievals of high flux and dynamic atmospheric features, e.g., clouds and aerosol layers.

Title: AI-Driven SEEG Channel Ranking for Epileptogenic Zone Localization
Authors: Saeed Hashemi, Genchang Peng, Mehrdad Nourani, Omar Nofal, Jay Harvey
Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and explainability.

Title: Data-Driven Nonlinear Regulation: Gaussian Process Learning
Authors: Telema Harry, Martin Guay, Shimin Wang, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: This article addresses the output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems using a data-driven approach. An output feedback controller is proposed that integrates a traditional control component with a data-driven learning algorithm based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the nonlinear internal model. Specifically, a data-driven technique is employed to directly approximate the unknown internal model steady-state map from observed input-output data online. Our method does not rely on model-based observers utilized in previous studies, making it robust and suitable for systems with modelling errors and model uncertainties. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical examples and detailed stability analysis that, under suitable conditions, the closed-loop system remains bounded and converges to a compact set, with the size of this set decreasing as the accuracy of the data-driven model improves over time.

Title: An Interpretable Two-Stage Feature Decomposition Method for Deep Learning-based SAR ATR
Authors: Chenwei Wang, Renjie Xu, Congwen Wu, Cunyi Yin, Ziyun Liao, Deqing Mao, Sitong Zhang, Hong Yan
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR) has seen significant performance improvements with deep learning. However, the black-box nature of deep SAR ATR introduces low confidence and high risks in decision-critical SAR applications, hindering practical deployment. To address this issue, deep SAR ATR should provide an interpretable reasoning basis $r_b$ and logic $\lambda_w$, forming the reasoning logic $\sum_{i} {{r_b^i} \times {\lambda_w^i}} =pred$ behind the decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes a physics-based two-stage feature decomposition method for interpretable deep SAR ATR, which transforms uninterpretable deep features into attribute scattering center components (ASCC) with clear physical meanings. First, ASCCs are obtained through a clustering algorithm. To extract independent physical components from deep features, we propose a two-stage decomposition method. In the first stage, a feature decoupling and discrimination module separates deep features into approximate ASCCs with global discriminability. In the second stage, a multilayer orthogonal non-negative matrix tri-factorization (MLO-NMTF) further decomposes the ASCCs into independent components with distinct physical meanings. The MLO-NMTF elegantly aligns with the clustering algorithms to obtain ASCCs. Finally, this method ensures both an interpretable reasoning process and accurate recognition results. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets confirm its effectiveness, showcasing the method's interpretability, robust recognition performance, and strong generalization capability.

Title: Integer-Clustering Optimization of Hydrogen and Battery EV Fleets Considering DERs
Authors: Sijia Geng, Thomas Lee, Dharik Mallapragada, Audun Botterud
Abstract: Electrified transportation leads to a tighter integration between transportation and energy distribution systems. In this work, we develop scalable optimization models to co-design hydrogen and battery electric vehicle (EV) fleets, distributed energy resources, and fast-charging and hydrogen-fueling infrastructure to efficiently meet transportation demands. A novel integer-clustering formulation is used for optimizing fleet-level EV operation while maintaining accurate individual vehicle dispatch, which significantly improves the computation efficiency with guaranteed performance. We apply the optimization model to Boston's public transit bus network using real geospatial data and cost parameters. Realistic insights are provided into the future evolution of coupled electricity-transportation-hydrogen systems, including the effects of electricity price structure, hydrogen fuel cost, carbon emission constraint, temperature effects on EV range, and distribution system upgrade cost.

Title: Voltage-Controlled Oscillator and Memristor-Based Analog Computing for Solving Systems of Linear Equations
Authors: Hao Li, Rizwan S. Peerla, Frank Barrows, Francesco Caravelli, Bibhu Datta Sahoo
Abstract: Matrix computations have become increasingly significant in many data-driven applications. However, Moores law for digital computers has been gradually approaching its limit in recent years. Moreover, digital computers encounter substantial complexity when performing matrix computations and need a long time to finish the computations, and existing analog matrix computation schemes require a large chip area and power consumption. This paper proposes a linear algebra system of equations based on integrators, which features low power consumption, compact area, and fast computation time. Due to the simple structure of the ring oscillator, the ring oscillator-based integrator exhibits a compact area and low power consumption. Therefore, ring oscillator-based integrators are introduced into the linear algebra system of equations, and this system can be used to compute the linear algebra equations of the matrix with either positive or negative values. This paper provides a detailed analysis and verification of the proposed circuit structure. Compared to similar circuits, this work has significant advantages in terms of area, power consumption, and computation speed.

Title: Large-scale LH2 pipeline infrastructure concept for airports
Authors: H. A. Krog, Y. Jooss, H. Fyhn, P. Nekså, I. Hjorth
Abstract: Infrastructure and processes for handling of liquid hydrogen (LH2) is needed to enable large-scale decarbonization of aviation with hydrogen aircraft. At large airports, pipeline and hydrant systems will be important for a mature hydrogen-powered air travel market. As the vaporization of LH2 is a challenge in fuel handling, the pipeline infrastructure must be designed and operated such that the fuel is subcooled. Through modelling and simulation of aircraft tanks refuelling by a pipeline infrastructure concept, it is found that continuous recycling of LH2 within the system is needed to maintain subcooling, and the pump operation is important for preventing flashing. With the proposed concept, some hydrogen vapor is formed in the aircraft tank, but the vapor can be utilised by hydrogen-powered ground support equipment.

Title: Eigenvalue-Based Detection in MIMO Systems for Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Alex Obando, Saman Atapattu, Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa, Akram Hourani, Kandeepan Sithamparanathan
Abstract: This paper considers a MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system, where a base station simultaneously serves a MIMO communication user and a remote MIMO sensing receiver, without channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Existing MIMO ISAC literature often prioritizes communication rate or detection probability, typically under constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) assumptions, without jointly analyzing detection reliability and communication constraints. To address this gap, we adopt an eigenvalue-based detector for robust sensing and use a performance metric, the total detection error, that jointly captures false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities. We derive novel closed-form expressions for both probabilities under the eigenvalue detector, enabling rigorous sensing analysis. Using these expressions, we formulate and solve a joint power allocation and threshold optimization problem that minimizes total detection error while meeting a minimum communication rate requirement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design substantially outperforms conventional CFAR-based schemes, highlighting the benefits of power- and threshold-aware optimization in MIMO ISAC systems.

Title: A Survey on the Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in 6G-V2X Applications
Authors: Donglin Wang, Anjie Qiu, Qiuheng Zhou, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is transforming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), with 6G networks expected to provide ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity connectivity for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as key enablers in optimizing V2X communication by enhancing network management, predictive analytics, security, and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past two years. Notably, AI, especially GL, has shown remarkable progress and emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered V2X ecosystems in 6G communication.

Title: You Are What You Say: Exploiting Linguistic Content for VoicePrivacy Attacks
Authors: Ünal Ege Gaznepoglu, Anna Leschanowsky, Ahmad Aloradi, Prachi Singh, Daniel Tenbrinck, Emanuël A. P. Habets, Nils Peters
Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets, by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER) of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances, stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

Title: Adaptive event-triggered robust tracking control of soft robots
Authors: Renjie Ma, Ziyao Qu, Zhijian Hu, Dong Zhao, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

Title: A Study on Speech Assessment with Visual Cues
Authors: Shafique Ahmed, Ryandhimas E. Zezario, Nasir Saleem, Amir Hussain, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Non-intrusive assessment of speech quality and intelligibility is essential when clean reference signals are unavailable. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that integrates audio features and visual cues to predict PESQ and STOI scores. It employs a dual-branch architecture, where spectral features are extracted using STFT, and visual embeddings are obtained via a visual encoder. These features are then fused and processed by a CNN-BLSTM with attention, followed by multi-task learning to simultaneously predict PESQ and STOI. Evaluations on the LRS3-TED dataset, augmented with noise from the DEMAND corpus, show that our model outperforms the audio-only baseline. Under seen noise conditions, it improves LCC by 9.61% (0.8397->0.9205) for PESQ and 11.47% (0.7403->0.8253) for STOI. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating visual cues in enhancing the accuracy of non-intrusive speech assessment.

Title: Probability-One Optimization of Generalized Rayleigh Quotient Sum For Multi-Source Generalized Total Least-Squares
Authors: Dominik Friml, Pavel Václavek
Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While various methods have been proposed for this problem, they do not guarantee convergence to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a probability-one homotopy optimization method that, under certain conditions, guarantees convergence to the global maximizer. The proposed method is analyzed alongside state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, evaluating their performance in terms of convergence speed and ability to reach the global maximizer. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its applicability.

Title: Unmasking real-world audio deepfakes: A data-centric approach
Authors: David Combei, Adriana Stan, Dan Oneata, Nicolas Müller, Horia Cucu
Abstract: The growing prevalence of real-world deepfakes presents a critical challenge for existing detection systems, which are often evaluated on datasets collected just for scientific purposes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset of real-world audio deepfakes. Our analysis reveals that these real-world examples pose significant challenges, even for the most performant detection models. Rather than increasing model complexity or exhaustively search for a better alternative, in this work we focus on a data-centric paradigm, employing strategies like dataset curation, pruning, and augmentation to improve model robustness and generalization. Through these methods, we achieve a 55% relative reduction in EER on the In-the-Wild dataset, reaching an absolute EER of 1.7%, and a 63% reduction on our newly proposed real-world deepfakes dataset, AI4T. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-centric approaches in enhancing deepfake detection for real-world applications. Code and data available at: this https URL.

Title: Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula for an n-step staircase multiplier
Authors: Ankitha E Bangera ((1) Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai, Mumbai)
Abstract: Solid-state devices such as multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are analogues to the photomultiplier tubes and are considered as a cascade-amplifier. The major source of internal noise in these APDs is due to the randomness in their stepwise impact ionization. Recent literature on staircase APDs by research groups such as Campbell and co-workers have reported the theoretical estimates of total excess noise factors using Capasso's excess noise factor formula. This formula is based on Friis' total noise factor formula for cascade networks. This article proves that Capasso's formula for a staircase APD, erroneously considers the power gains in Friis' total noise factor formula as the gains.

Title: Recognizing Every Voice: Towards Inclusive ASR for Rural Bhojpuri Women
Authors: Sakshi Joshi, Eldho Ittan George, Tahir Javed, Kaushal Bhogale, Nikhil Narasimhan, Mitesh M. Khapra
Abstract: Digital inclusion remains a challenge for marginalized communities, especially rural women in low-resource language regions like Bhojpuri. Voice-based access to agricultural services, financial transactions, government schemes, and healthcare is vital for their empowerment, yet existing ASR systems for this group remain largely untested. To address this gap, we create SRUTI ,a benchmark consisting of rural Bhojpuri women speakers. Evaluation of current ASR models on SRUTI shows poor performance due to data scarcity, which is difficult to overcome due to social and cultural barriers that hinder large-scale data collection. To overcome this, we propose generating synthetic speech using just 25-30 seconds of audio per speaker from approximately 100 rural women. Augmenting existing datasets with this synthetic data achieves an improvement of 4.7 WER, providing a scalable, minimally intrusive solution to enhance ASR and promote digital inclusion in low-resource language.

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden, particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive, resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality and better patient outcomes worldwide.

Title: Bridging Continuous-time LQR and Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Flow of the Bellman Error
Authors: Armin Gießler, Albertus Johannes Malan, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for computing the optimal feedback gain of the infinite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem via an ordinary differential equation. We introduce a novel continuous-time Bellman error, derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which quantifies the suboptimality of stabilizing policies and is parametrized in terms of the feedback gain. We analyze its properties, including its effective domain, smoothness, coerciveness and show the existence of a unique stationary point within the stability region. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form gradient expression of the Bellman error that induces a gradient flow. This converges to the optimal feedback and generates a unique trajectory which exclusively comprises stabilizing feedback policies. Additionally, this work advances interesting connections between LQR theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) by redefining suboptimality of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) as a Bellman error, adapting a state-independent formulation, and leveraging Lyapunov equations to overcome the infinite-horizon challenge. We validate our method in a simulation and compare it to the state of the art.

Title: Fine-Tuning Large Audio-Language Models with LoRA for Precise Temporal Localization of Prolonged Exposure Therapy Elements
Authors: Suhas BN, Andrew M. Sherrill, Jyoti Alaparthi, Dominik Mattioli, Rosa I. Arriaga, Chris W. Wiese, Saeed Abdullah
Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Title: Don't be Afraid of Cell Complexes! An Introduction from an Applied Perspective
Authors: Josef Hoppe, Vincent P. Grande, Michael T. Schaub
Abstract: Cell complexes (CCs) are a higher-order network model deeply rooted in algebraic topology that has gained interest in signal processing and network science recently. However, while the processing of signals supported on CCs can be described in terms of easily-accessible algebraic or combinatorial notions, the commonly presented definition of CCs is grounded in abstract concepts from topology and remains disconnected from the signal processing methods developed for CCs. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a simplified definition of CCs that is accessible to a wider audience and can be used in practical applications. Specifically, we first introduce a simplified notion of abstract regular cell complexes (ARCCs). These ARCCs only rely on notions from algebra and can be shown to be equivalent to regular cell complexes for most practical applications. Second, using this new definition we provide an accessible introduction to (abstract) cell complexes from a perspective of network science and signal processing. Furthermore, as many practical applications work with CCs of dimension 2 and below, we provide an even simpler definition for this case that significantly simplifies understanding and working with CCs in practice.

Title: End-to-End Dynamic Metasurface Antenna Wireless System: Prototype, Opportunities, and Challenges
Authors: François Yven, Jean Tapie, Jérôme Sol, Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising hybrid analog/digital beamforming technology to realize next-generation wireless systems with low cost, footprint, and power consumption. The research on DMA-empowered wireless systems is still at an early stage, mostly limited to theoretical studies under simplifying assumptions on the one hand and a few antenna-level experiments on the other hand. Substantial knowledge gaps arise from the lack of complete end-to-end DMA-empowered wireless system prototypes. In addition, recently unveiled benefits of strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) in DMAs remain untapped. Here, we demonstrate a K-band prototype of an end-to-end wireless system based on a DMA with strong inter-element MC. To showcase the flexible control over the DMA's radiation pattern, we present an experimental case study of simultaneously steering a beam to a desired transmitter and a null to an undesired jammer, achieving up to 43~dB discrimination. Using software-defined radios, we transmit and receive QPSK OFDM waveforms to evaluate the bit error rate. We also discuss algorithmic and technological challenges associated with envisioned future evolutions of our end-to-end testbed and real-life DMA-based wireless systems.

Title: Cross-Channel Unlabeled Sensing over a Union of Signal Subspaces
Authors: Taulant Koka, Manolis C. Tsakiris, Benjamín Béjar Haro, Michael Muma
Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal reconstruction.

Title: Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Peter Vieting, Maximilian Kannen, Benedikt Hilmes, Ralf Schlüter, Hermann Ney
Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Title: Enhanced V2X Communication Using Game-Theory Based Adaptive MAC Protocols
Authors: Dhrumil Bhatt, Nirbhay Singhal
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system featuring adaptive Medium Access Control (MAC) using game theory. Our approach integrates dynamic transmission power control, dynamic beacon rates, contention window adaptation, and implicit acknowledgment mechanisms within a Manhattan-like grid-based mobility scenario. Simulations are conducted in a circular coverage area, incorporating refined signal propagation models and probabilistic vehicle mobility with boundary reflection. The results demonstrate effective beacon delivery with average delays under 0.35 s and packet loss rates less than 1% in high-density conditions specifically, with up to 80 vehicles operating within a 250 m radius. Key innovations include game theory-based environment-aware transmission parameter adaptation and a scalable design suited for interference-prone V2X deployments.

Title: Foundation Model-Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communication
Authors: Mohammad Ghassemi, Sara Farrag Mobarak, Han Zhang, Ali Afana, Akram Bin Sediq, Melike Erol-Kantarci
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication by dynamically controlling signal propagation in the environment. However, their efficient deployment relies on accurate channel state information (CSI), which leads to high channel estimation overhead due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements. In this work, we solve this challenge by proposing a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained open-source foundation model (FM) named large wireless model (LWM) to process wireless channels and generate versatile and contextualized channel embeddings. These embeddings are then used for the joint optimization of the BS beamforming and RIS configurations. To be more specific, for joint optimization, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to automatically select the BS beamforming vector and RIS phase-shift matrix, aiming to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). This work shows that a pre-trained FM for radio signal understanding can be fine-tuned and integrated with DRL for effective decision-making in wireless networks. It highlights the potential of modality-specific FMs in real-world network optimization. According to the simulation results, the proposed method outperforms the DRL-based approach and beam sweeping-based approach, achieving 9.89% and 43.66% higher SE, respectively.

Title: Corrections to Friis noise factor formulas for cascade networks
Authors: Ankitha E Bangera ((1) Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Powai, Mumbai, India)
Abstract: The signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage cascade network is often estimated using the well-known Friis' formulas for noise factors (or the noise figures in decibels). However, this article addresses the major errors in Friis' noise factor formulas for higher stages. Additionally, we re-derive the correct formulas to calculate the stage-wise noise factors for cascade networks from the basic definition of noise factors. We then present a comparison of our derived formulas with Friis' noise factor formulas. Contrary to Friis' formula, we define the total noise factor of an n-stage cascade network as the product of its stage-wise noise factors. We further validate our derived formulas for a cascade network by correlating them with the expressions for a staircase avalanche photodiode.

Title: Sampling Theory for Super-Resolution with Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Mahrokh Najaf, Gregory Ongie
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom images.

Title: Reconstructing Heterogeneous Biomolecules via Hierarchical Gaussian Mixtures and Part Discovery
Authors: Shayan Shekarforoush, David B. Lindell, Marcus A. Brubaker, David J. Fleet
Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for 4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle, providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM heterogeneity methods.

Title: On Polynomial Stochastic Barrier Functions: Bernstein Versus Sum-of-Squares
Authors: Peter Amorese, Morteza Lahijanian
Abstract: Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) certify the safety of stochastic systems by formulating a functional optimization problem, which state-of-the-art methods solve using Sum-of-Squares (SoS) polynomials. This work focuses on polynomial SBFs and introduces a new formulation based on Bernstein polynomials and provides a comparative analysis of its theoretical and empirical performance against SoS methods. We show that the Bernstein formulation leads to a linear program (LP), in contrast to the semi-definite program (SDP) required for SoS, and that its relaxations exhibit favorable theoretical convergence properties. However, our empirical results reveal that the Bernstein approach struggles to match SoS in practical performance, exposing an intriguing gap between theoretical advantages and real-world feasibility.

Title: PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation
Authors: Peidong Wang, Jian Xue, Rui Zhao, Junkun Chen, Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian, Jinyu Li
Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations. However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase recall.

Title: Fractional Fourier Sound Synthesis
Authors: Esteban Gutiérrez, Rodrigo Cádiz, Carlos Sing Long, Frederic Font, Xavier Serra
Abstract: This paper explores the innovative application of the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) in sound synthesis, highlighting its potential to redefine time-frequency analysis in audio processing. As an extension of the classical Fourier Transform, the FrFT introduces fractional order parameters, enabling a continuous interpolation between time and frequency domains and unlocking unprecedented flexibility in signal manipulation. Crucially, the FrFT also opens the possibility of directly synthesizing sounds in the alpha-domain, providing a unique framework for creating timbral and dynamic characteristics unattainable through conventional methods. This work delves into the mathematical principles of the FrFT, its historical evolution, and its capabilities for synthesizing complex audio textures. Through experimental analyses, we showcase novel sound design techniques, such as alpha-synthesis and alpha-filtering, which leverage the FrFT's time-frequency rotation properties to produce innovative sonic results. The findings affirm the FrFT's value as a transformative tool for composers, sound designers, and researchers seeking to push the boundaries of auditory creativity.

Title: SimClass: A Classroom Speech Dataset Generated via Game Engine Simulation For Automatic Speech Recognition Research
Authors: Ahmed Adel Attia, Jing Liu, Carl Espy-Wilson
Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the use of standard data augmentation techniques. In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions. Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

Title: A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs
Authors: Bruno Ferenc Šegedin
Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training. Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck: generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.

Title: CoLMbo: Speaker Language Model for Descriptive Profiling
Authors: Massa Baali, Shuo Han, Syed Abdul Hannan, Purusottam Samal, Karanveer Singh, Soham Deshmukh, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj
Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect, gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets, marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

Title: Bipedal Balance Control with Whole-body Musculoskeletal Standing and Falling Simulations
Authors: Chengtian Ma, Yunyue Wei, Chenhui Zuo, Chen Zhang, Yanan Sui
Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

Title: OWSM-Biasing: Contextualizing Open Whisper-Style Speech Models for Automatic Speech Recognition with Dynamic Vocabulary
Authors: Yui Sudo, Yusuke Fujita, Atsushi Kojima, Tomoya Mizumoto, Lianbo Liu
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models (OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs, even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9 point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by 7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean set.

Title: BemaGANv2: A Tutorial and Comparative Survey of GAN-based Vocoders for Long-Term Audio Generation
Authors: Taesoo Park, Mungwi Jeong, Mingyu Park, Narae Kim, Junyoung Kim, Mujung Kim, Jisang Yoo, Hoyun Lee, Sanghoon Kim, Soonchul Kwon
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD + MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM, PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility.

Title: Generalized Gaussian Entropy Model for Point Cloud Attribute Compression with Dynamic Likelihood Intervals
Authors: Changhao Peng, Yuqi Ye, Wei Gao
Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents. However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression tasks, such as image and video compression.

Title: Spectral Efficiency Maximization for DMA-enabled Multiuser MISO with Statistical CSI
Authors: Hao Xu, Boyu Ning, Chongjun Ouyang, Hongwen Yang
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) offer the potential to achieve large-scale antenna arrays with low power consumption and reduced hardware costs, making them a promising technology for future communication systems. This paper investigates the spectral efficiency (SE) of DMA-enabled multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems in both uplink and downlink transmissions, using only statistical channel state information (CSI) to maximize the ergodic sum rate of multiple users. For the uplink system, we consider two decoding rules: minimum mean square error (MMSE) with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). For both decoders, we derive closed-form surrogates to substitute the original expressions of ergodic sum rate and formulate tractable optimization problems for designing DMA weights. Then, a weighted MMSE (WMMSE)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the ergodic sum rate. For the downlink system, we derive an approximate expression for the ergodic sum rate and formulate a hybrid analog/digital beamforming optimization problem that jointly optimizes the digital precoder and DMA weights. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed by leveraging the fractional programming framework. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived surrogates and highlight the superiority of the proposed algorithms over baseline schemes. It is shown that these algorithms are effective across various DMA settings and are particularly well-suited for system design in fast time-varying channels.

Title: HopaDIFF: Holistic-Partial Aware Fourier Conditioned Diffusion for Referring Human Action Segmentation in Multi-Person Scenarios
Authors: Kunyu Peng, Junchao Huang, Xiangsheng Huang, Di Wen, Junwei Zheng, Yufan Chen, Kailun Yang, Jiamin Wu, Chongqing Hao, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Training-Free Voice Conversion with Factorized Optimal Transport
Authors: Alexander Lobashev, Assel Yermekova, Maria Larchenko
Abstract: This paper introduces Factorized MKL-VC, a training-free modification for kNN-VC pipeline. In contrast with original pipeline, our algorithm performs high quality any-to-any cross-lingual voice conversion with only 5 second of reference audio. MKL-VC replaces kNN regression with a factorized optimal transport map in WavLM embedding subspaces, derived from Monge-Kantorovich Linear solution. Factorization addresses non-uniform variance across dimensions, ensuring effective feature transformation. Experiments on LibriSpeech and FLEURS datasets show MKL-VC significantly improves content preservation and robustness with short reference audio, outperforming kNN-VC. MKL-VC achieves performance comparable to FACodec, especially in cross-lingual voice conversion domain.

Title: Vulnerability-Based Optimal Grid Defense Strategies for Enhancing Cyber-Physical Energy System Resilience
Authors: Eric Tönges, Philipp Härtel, Martin Braun
Abstract: An approach is proposed to identify optimal asset protection strategies based on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Traditional bilevel attacker-defender models emphasize worstcase scenarios but offer limited defensive guidance. In contrast, trilevel models introduce high computational complexity and rely on fixed network configurations. The proposed critical-components method leverages vulnerability assessment results to determine protection strategies, effectively outsourcing the upper-level defense decision. This enables adaptability to diverse network topologies, assessment techniques, and cyber-physical energy systems without the overhead of multi-level optimization. Case studies demonstrate the potential for improved system resilience across varying operational conditions.

Title: A Saddle Point Algorithm for Robust Data-Driven Factor Model Problems
Authors: Shabnam Khodakaramzadeh, Soroosh Shafiee, Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: We study the factor model problem, which aims to uncover low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional datasets. Adopting a robust data-driven approach, we formulate the problem as a saddle-point optimization. Our primary contribution is a general first-order algorithm that solves this reformulation by leveraging a linear minimization oracle (LMO). We further develop semi-closed form solutions (up to a scalar) for three specific LMOs, corresponding to the Frobenius norm, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Gelbrich (aka Wasserstein) distance. The analysis includes explicit quantification of these LMOs' regularity conditions, notably the Lipschitz constants of the dual function, whthich govern the algorithm's convergence performance. Numerical experiments confirm our meod's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings, outperforming standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.

Authors: Wenxuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.

Title: Physical Layer-Based Device Fingerprinting for Wireless Security: From Theory to Practice
Authors: Junqing Zhang, Francesco Ardizzon, Mattia Piana, Guanxiong Shen, Stefano Tomasin
Abstract: The identification of the devices from which a message is received is part of security mechanisms to ensure authentication in wireless communications. Conventional authentication approaches are cryptography-based, which, however, are usually computationally expensive and not adequate in the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices tend to be low-cost and with limited resources. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of physical layer-based device fingerprinting, which is an emerging device authentication for wireless security. In particular, this article focuses on hardware impairment-based identity authentication and channel features-based authentication. They are passive techniques that are readily applicable to legacy IoT devices. Their intrinsic hardware and channel features, algorithm design methodologies, application scenarios, and key research questions are extensively reviewed here. The remaining research challenges are discussed, and future work is suggested that can further enhance the physical layer-based device fingerprinting.

Title: UmbraTTS: Adapting Text-to-Speech to Environmental Contexts with Flow Matching
Authors: Neta Glazer, Aviv Navon, Yael Segal, Aviv Shamsian, Hilit Segev, Asaf Buchnick, Menachem Pirchi, Gil Hetz, Joseph Keshet
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural, high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

Title: Aucamp: An Underwater Camera-Based Multi-Robot Platform with Low-Cost, Distributed, and Robust Localization
Authors: Jisheng Xu, Ding Lin, Pangkit Fong, Chongrong Fang, Xiaoming Duan, Jianping He
Abstract: This paper introduces an underwater multi-robot platform, named Aucamp, characterized by cost-effective monocular-camera-based sensing, distributed protocol and robust orientation control for localization. We utilize the clarity feature to measure the distance, present the monocular imaging model, and estimate the position of the target object. We achieve global positioning in our platform by designing a distributed update protocol. The distributed algorithm enables the perception process to simultaneously cover a broader range, and greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of the positioning. Moreover, the explicit dynamics model of the robot in our platform is obtained, based on which, we propose a robust orientation control framework. The control system ensures that the platform maintains a balanced posture for each robot, thereby ensuring the stability of the localization system. The platform can swiftly recover from an forced unstable state to a stable horizontal posture. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments and application scenarios to evaluate the performance of our platform. The proposed new platform may provide support for extensive marine exploration by underwater sensor networks.

Title: Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling is Good for Single-Carrier ISAC: An Analytical Study
Authors: Shuangyang Li, Fan Liu, Yifeng Xiong, Weijie Yuan, Baoming Bai, Christos Masouros, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an analytical study of single-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new insights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol rate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse. Specifically, the communication spectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath channels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the spectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds corresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the presence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the symbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR variation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the maximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in terms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function. We show that FTN signals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance. More importantly, we prove that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the undesired peaks in the considered ambiguity function along the Doppler dimension, thereby reducing the ambiguities in velocity estimation. All these conclusions are explicitly verified by numerical results.

Title: Coil2Coil: Self-supervised MR image denoising using phased-array coil images
Authors: Juhyung Park, Dongwon Park, Sooyeon Ji, Hyeong-Geol Shin, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee
Abstract: Denoising of magnetic resonance images is beneficial in improving the quality of low signal-to-noise ratio images. Recently, denoising using deep neural networks has demonstrated promising results. Most of these networks, however, utilize supervised learning, which requires large training images of noise-corrupted and clean image pairs. Obtaining training images, particularly clean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as Noise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been developed to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study, we propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does not require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images for training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array coils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel coil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they are processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such that they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method inputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application of the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the best performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable outcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully denoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error maps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans for clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various clinical applications.

Title: On Embedding B-Splines in Recursive State Estimation
Authors: Kailai Li
Abstract: We present a principled study on establishing a recursive Bayesian estimation scheme using B-splines in Euclidean spaces. The use of recurrent control points as the state vector is first conceptualized in a recursive setting. This enables the embedding of B-splines into the state-space model as a continuous-time intermediate, bridging discrete-time state transition with asynchronous multisensor observations. Building on this spline-state-space model, we propose the spline-embedded recursive estimation scheme for general multisensor state estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations are conducted on motion tracking in sensor networks with time-difference-of-arrival and time-of-arrival-inertial settings using real-world and real-world-based synthetic datasets, respectively. Numerical results evidently demonstrate several advantages of spline embedding in recursive state estimation over classical discrete-time filtering approaches in terms of tracking accuracy, robustness, and memory efficiency.

Title: Plug-and-Play image restoration with Stochastic deNOising REgularization
Authors: Marien Renaud, Jean Prost, Arthur Leclaire, Nicolas Papadakis
Abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are a class of iterative algorithms that address image inverse problems by combining a physical model and a deep neural network for regularization. Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Title: Listen, Chat, and Remix: Text-Guided Soundscape Remixing for Enhanced Auditory Experience
Authors: Xilin Jiang, Cong Han, Yinghao Aaron Li, Nima Mesgarani
Abstract: In daily life, we encounter a variety of sounds, both desirable and undesirable, with limited control over their presence and volume. Our work introduces "Listen, Chat, and Remix" (LCR), a novel multimodal sound remixer that controls each sound source in a mixture based on user-provided text instructions. LCR distinguishes itself with a user-friendly text interface and its unique ability to remix multiple sound sources simultaneously within a mixture, without needing to separate them. Users input open-vocabulary text prompts, which are interpreted by a large language model to create a semantic filter for remixing the sound mixture. The system then decomposes the mixture into its components, applies the semantic filter, and reassembles filtered components back to the desired output. We developed a 160-hour dataset with over 100k mixtures, including speech and various audio sources, along with text prompts for diverse remixing tasks including extraction, removal, and volume control of single or multiple sources. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in signal quality across all remixing tasks and robust performance in zero-shot scenarios with varying numbers and types of sound sources.

Title: A Comparative Study of Conventional and Tripolar EEG for High-Performance Reach-to-Grasp BCI Systems
Authors: Ali Rabiee, Sima Ghafoori, Anna Cetera, Maryam Norouzi, Walter Besio, Reza Abiri
Abstract: This study aims to enhance BCI applications for individuals with motor impairments by comparing the effectiveness of tripolar EEG (tEEG) with conventional EEG. The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.

Title: PRoTECT: Parallelized Construction of Safety Barrier Certificates for Nonlinear Polynomial Systems
Authors: Ben Wooding, Viacheslav Horbanov, Abolfazl Lavaei
Abstract: We develop an open-source software tool, called PRoTECT, for the parallelized construction of safety barrier certificates (BCs) for nonlinear polynomial systems. This tool employs sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs to systematically search for polynomial-type BCs, while aiming to verify safety properties over four classes of dynamical systems: (i) discrete-time stochastic systems, (ii) discrete-time deterministic systems, (iii) continuous-time stochastic systems, and (iv) continuous-time deterministic systems. PRoTECT is implemented in Python as an application programming interface (API), offering users the flexibility to interact either through its user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) or via function calls from other Python programs. PRoTECT leverages parallelism across different barrier degrees to efficiently search for a feasible BC.

Title: Towards a Sampling Theory for Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Mahrokh Najaf, Gregory Ongie
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end, we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image from its low-pass Fourier coefficients by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a sufficient number of samples for which an image realized by a width-1 INR is exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem, and give a conjecture for the general width-$W$ case. To validate our theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the performance of INR on super-resolution recovery of more realistic continuous domain phantom images.

Title: Einstein from Noise: Statistical Analysis
Authors: Amnon Balanov, Wasim Huleihel, Tamir Bendory
Abstract: ``Einstein from noise" (EfN) is a prominent example of the model bias phenomenon: systematic errors in the statistical model that lead to spurious but consistent estimates. In the EfN experiment, one falsely believes that a set of observations contains noisy, shifted copies of a template signal (e.g., an Einstein image), whereas in reality, it contains only pure noise observations. To estimate the signal, the observations are first aligned with the template using cross-correlation, and then averaged. Although the observations contain nothing but noise, it was recognized early on that this process produces a signal that resembles the template signal! This pitfall was at the heart of a central scientific controversy about validation techniques in structural biology. This paper provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of the EfN phenomenon above. We show that the Fourier phases of the EfN estimator (namely, the average of the aligned noise observations) converge to the Fourier phases of the template signal, explaining the observed structural similarity. Additionally, we prove that the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the number of noise observations and, in the high-dimensional regime, to the Fourier magnitudes of the template signal. Moreover, in the high-dimensional regime, the Fourier magnitudes converge to a scaled version of the template signal's Fourier magnitudes. This work not only deepens the theoretical understanding of the EfN phenomenon but also highlights potential pitfalls in template matching techniques and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of noisy observations across disciplines in engineering, statistics, physics, and biology.

Title: TERIME: An improved RIME algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation for robust parameter extraction of photovoltaic models
Authors: Shi-Shun Chen, Yu-Tong Jiang, Wen-Bin Chen, Xiao-Yang Li
Abstract: Parameter extraction of photovoltaic (PV) models is crucial for the planning, optimization, and control of PV systems. Although some methods using meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to determine these parameters, the robustness of solutions obtained by these methods faces great challenges when the complexity of the PV model increases. The unstable results will affect the reliable operation and maintenance strategies of PV systems. In response to this challenge, an improved rime optimization algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation, termed TERIME, is proposed for robust and accurate parameter identification for various PV models. Specifically, the differential evolution mutation operator is integrated in the exploration phase to enhance the population diversity. Meanwhile, a new exploitation strategy incorporating randomization and neighborhood strategies simultaneously is developed to maintain the balance of exploitation width and depth. The TERIME algorithm is applied to estimate the optimal parameters of the single diode model, double diode model, and triple diode model combined with the Lambert-W function for three PV cell and module types including RTC France, Photo Watt-PWP 201 and S75. According to the statistical analysis in 100 runs, the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate and robust parameter estimations than other techniques to various PV models in varying environmental conditions.

Title: Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent
Authors: Sunbochen Tang, Haoyuan Sun, Navid Azizan
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.

Title: UKAN-EP: Enhancing U-KAN with Efficient Attention and Pyramid Aggregation for 3D Multi-Modal MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Yanbing Chen, Tianze Tang, Taehyo Kim, Hai Shu
Abstract: Gliomas are among the most common malignant brain tumors and are characterized by considerable heterogeneity, which complicates accurate detection and segmentation. Multi-modal MRI is the clinical standard for glioma imaging, but variability across modalities and high computational complexity hinder effective automated segmentation. In this paper, we propose UKAN-EP, a novel 3D extension of the original 2D U-KAN model for multi-modal MRI brain tumor segmentation. While U-KAN integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into a U-Net backbone, UKAN-EP further incorporates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Pyramid Feature Aggregation (PFA) modules to enhance inter-modality feature fusion and multi-scale feature representation. We also introduce a dynamic loss weighting strategy that adaptively balances the Cross-Entropy and Dice losses during training. We evaluate UKAN-EP on the 2024 BraTS-GLI dataset and compare it against strong baselines including U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Swin UNETR. Results show that UKAN-EP achieves superior segmentation performance while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. An extensive ablation study further demonstrates the effectiveness of ECA and PFA, as well as the limited utility of self-attention and spatial attention alternatives.

Title: NeRF-CA: Dynamic Reconstruction of X-ray Coronary Angiography with Extremely Sparse-views
Authors: Kirsten W.H. Maas, Danny Ruijters, Anna Vilanova, Nicola Pezzotti
Abstract: Dynamic three-dimensional (4D) reconstruction from two-dimensional X-ray coronary angiography (CA) remains a significant clinical problem. Existing CA reconstruction methods often require extensive user interaction or large training datasets. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has successfully reconstructed high-fidelity scenes in natural and medical contexts without these requirements. However, challenges such as sparse-views, intra-scan motion, and complex vessel morphology hinder its direct application to CA data. We introduce NeRF-CA, a first step toward a fully automatic 4D CA reconstruction that achieves reconstructions from sparse coronary angiograms. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the challenges of sparse-views and cardiac motion by decoupling the scene into the moving coronary artery and the static background, effectively translating the problem of motion into a strength. NeRF-CA serves as a first stepping stone for solving the 4D CA reconstruction problem, achieving adequate 4D reconstructions from as few as four angiograms, as required by clinical practice, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art sparse-view X-ray NeRF. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively using representative 4D phantom datasets and ablation studies. To accelerate research in this domain, we made our codebase public: this https URL.

Title: Channel Adaptation for Speaker Verification Using Optimal Transport with Pseudo Label
Authors: Wenhao Yang, Jianguo Wei, Wenhuan Lu, Lei Li, Xugang Lu
Abstract: Domain gap often degrades the performance of speaker verification (SV) systems when the statistical distributions of training data and real-world test speech are mismatched. Channel variation, a primary factor causing this gap, is less addressed than other issues (e.g., noise). Although various domain adaptation algorithms could be applied to handle this domain gap problem, most algorithms could not take the complex distribution structure in domain alignment with discriminative learning. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, i.e., Joint Partial Optimal Transport with Pseudo Label (JPOT-PL), to alleviate the channel mismatch problem. Leveraging the geometric-aware distance metric of optimal transport in distribution alignment, we further design a pseudo label-based discriminative learning where the pseudo label can be regarded as a new type of soft speaker label derived from the optimal coupling. With the JPOT-PL, we carry out experiments on the SV channel adaptation task with VoxCeleb as the basis corpus. Experiments show our method reduces EER by over 10% compared with several state-of-the-art channel adaptation algorithms.

Title: UAV-Enabled Data Collection for IoT Networks via Rainbow Learning
Authors: Yingchao Jiao, Xuhui Zhang, Wenchao Liu, Yinyu Wu, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Bo Yang, Xinping Guan
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled Internet of things (IoT) systems have become an important part of future wireless communications. To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. In this paper, a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume from the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the variables are highly coupled, it is hard to be solved using traditional methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, called rainbow learning based algorithm (RLA), and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Specifically, the outer-loop of the RLA utilizes a fusion deep Q-network to optimize the UAV trajectory, GN scheduling, and power allocation, while the inner-loop optimizes receive beamforming by successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes, energy efficiency, and fairness.

Title: ERVQ: Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization with Intra-and-Inter-Codebook Optimization for Neural Audio Codecs
Authors: Rui-Chen Zheng, Hui-Peng Du, Xiao-Hang Jiang, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Current neural audio codecs typically use residual vector quantization (RVQ) to discretize speech signals. However, they often experience codebook collapse, which reduces the effective codebook size and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce ERVQ, Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization, a novel enhancement strategy for the RVQ framework in neural audio codecs. ERVQ mitigates codebook collapse and boosts codec performance through both intra- and inter-codebook optimization. Intra-codebook optimization incorporates an online clustering strategy and a code balancing loss to ensure balanced and efficient codebook utilization. Inter-codebook optimization improves the diversity of quantized features by minimizing the similarity between successive quantizations. Our experiments show that ERVQ significantly enhances audio codec performance across different models, sampling rates, and bitrates, achieving superior quality and generalization capabilities. It also achieves 100% codebook utilization on one of the most advanced neural audio codecs. Further experiments indicate that audio codecs improved by the ERVQ strategy can improve unified speech-and-text large language models (LLMs). Specifically, there is a notable improvement in the naturalness of generated speech in downstream zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Audio samples are available here.

Title: Phonology-Guided Speech-to-Speech Translation for African Languages
Authors: Peter Ochieng, Dennis Kaburu
Abstract: We present a prosody-guided framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that aligns and translates speech \emph{without} transcripts by leveraging cross-linguistic pause synchrony. Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.

Title: Model Attribution and Detection of Synthetic Speech via Vocoder Fingerprints
Authors: Matías Pizarro, Mike Laszkiewicz, Shawkat Hesso, Dorothea Kolossa, Asja Fischer
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, so do the potential threats of misusing synthetic speech signals. This work tackles three tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting corresponding to the task of identifying whether synthetic speech signals originate from a specific vocoder (which requires only target vocoder data), (2) model attribution in a closed-world setting that corresponds to selecting the specific model that generated a sample from a given set of models, and (3) distinguishing synthetic from real speech. We show that standardized average residuals between audio signals and their low-pass or EnCodec filtered versions serve as powerful vocoder fingerprints that can be leveraged for all tasks achieving an average AUROC of over 99% on LJSpeech and JSUT in most settings. The accompanying robustness study shows that it is also resilient to noise levels up to a certain degree.

Title: A Novel Comprehensive Multiport Network Model for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) Characterization and Optimization
Authors: Andrea Abrardo, Giulio Bartoli, Alberto Toccafondi
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent transformative technologies for next-generation wireless communications, offering advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation. While RIS have been extensively studied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept to multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization challenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing an optimization framework for SIM that, unlike previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive model without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for broader applicability of the results. We first present a model based on multi-port network theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative object (ECO) and derive a framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the SIM as an ECO with a specific architecture, offering insights into SIM optimization for various configurations and discussing the complexities associated with each case. Finally, we demonstrate that the comprehensive model considered in this work simplifies to the model traditionally used in the literature when the assumption of unilateral propagation between the levels of the SIM is made, and mutual coupling between the SIM elements is neglected. To assess the applicability of these assumptions, a case study focused on the realization of a 2D DFT was undertaken. In this context, we highlight that these assumptions introduce a significant mismatch between the SIM model and its behavior as described by the complete model, making these approximations inadequate for optimizing the SIM. Conversely, we show that employing the complete model proposed in this paper can yield excellent performance.

Title: The Expected Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of White Gaussian Noise in Sampled I/Q Data
Authors: Adam Wunderlich, Aric Sanders
Abstract: One of the fundamental endeavors in radio frequency (RF) metrology is to measure the power of signals, where a common aim is to estimate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which quantifies the ratio of the maximum (peak) to the mean value. For a finite number of discrete-time samples of baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) white Gaussian noise (WGN) that are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, we derive a closed-form, exact formula for mean PAPR that is well-approximated by the natural logarithm of the number of samples plus Euler's constant. Additionally, we give related theoretical results for the mean crest factor (CF). After comparing our main result to previously published approximate formulas, we examine how violations of the WGN assumptions in sampled I/Q data result in deviations from the expected value of PAPR. Finally, utilizing a measured RF I/Q acquisition, we illustrate how our formula for mean PAPR can be applied to spectral analysis with spectrograms to verify when measured RF emissions are WGN in a given frequency band.

Title: System Identification Under Bounded Noise: Optimal Rates Beyond Least Squares
Authors: Xiong Zeng, Jing Yu, Necmiye Ozay
Abstract: System identification is a fundamental problem in control and learning, particularly in high-stakes applications where data efficiency is critical. Classical approaches, such as the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate under Gaussian noise assumptions, where $T$ is the number of samples. This rate has been shown to match the lower bound. However, in many practical scenarios, noise is known to be bounded, opening the possibility of improving sample complexity. In this work, we establish the minimax lower bound for system identification under bounded noise, proving that the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate is indeed optimal. We further demonstrate that OLS remains limited to an $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, making it fundamentally suboptimal in the presence of bounded noise. Finally, we instantiate two natural variations of OLS that obtain the optimal sample complexity.

Title: The trajectoRIR Database: Room Acoustic Recordings Along a Trajectory of Moving Microphones
Authors: Stefano Damiano, Kathleen MacWilliam, Valerio Lorenzoni, Thomas Dietzen, Toon van Waterschoot
Abstract: Data availability is essential to develop acoustic signal processing algorithms, especially when it comes to data-driven approaches that demand large and diverse training datasets. For this reason, an increasing number of databases have been published in recent years, including either room impulse responses (RIRs) or audio recordings during motion. In this paper we introduce the trajectoRIR database, an extensive, multi-array collection of both dynamic and stationary acoustic recordings along a controlled trajectory in a room. Specifically, the database features recordings using moving microphones and stationary RIRs spatially sampling the room acoustics along an L-shaped trajectory. This combination makes trajectoRIR unique and applicable in various tasks ranging from sound source localization and tracking to spatially dynamic sound field reconstruction, auralization and system identification. The recording room has a reverberation time of 0.5 seconds, and the three different microphone configurations employed include a dummy head, with additional reference microphones located next to the ears, 3 first-order Ambisonics microphones, two circular arrays of 16 and 4 channels, and a 12-channel linear array. The motion of the microphones was achieved using a robotic cart traversing a 4.62 meter-long rail at three speeds: [0.2, 0.4, 0.8] m/s. Audio signals were reproduced using two stationary loudspeakers. The collected database features 8648 stationary RIRs, as well as perfect sweeps, speech, music, and stationary noise recorded during motion. Python functions are included to access the recorded audio as well as to retrieve geometrical information.

Title: SpikeSift: A Computationally Efficient and Drift-Resilient Spike Sorting Algorithm
Authors: Vasileios Georgiadis, Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis
Abstract: Objective: Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analysing extracellular recordings, enabling the isolation of single-neuron activity. However, it remains a challenging problem because extracellular traces mix overlapping spikes from neighbouring cells and are marred by recording instabilities such as electrode drift. Numerous algorithms have been proposed, yet many struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting their practicality for todays large-scale datasets. Approach: In response, we introduce SpikeSift, a spike-sorting algorithm expressly designed to mitigate drift while running on standard CPUs. SpikeSift (i) partitions long recordings into shorter, relatively stationary segments, (ii) carries out spike detection and clustering simultaneously through an iterative detect-and-subtract scheme within each segment, and (iii) preserves neuronal identity across segments via a fast template alignment stage that dispenses with continuous trajectory estimation. Main results: Extensive validation on paired intracellularly validated datasets and on biophysically realistic MEArec simulations covering elevated noise, diverse drift profiles, ultra short recordings and bursting activity, demonstrates that SpikeSift matches or exceeds the accuracy of state of the art methods while completing sorting an order of magnitude faster on a single desktop core. Significance: The combination of high fidelity, drift resilience, and modest computational demand renders SpikeSift broadly accessible while preserving data quality for downstream neurophysiological analysis

Title: UAV-Assisted 5G Networks: Mobility-Aware 3D Trajectory Optimization and Resource Allocation for Dynamic Environments
Authors: Asad Mahmood, Thang X. Vu, Wali Ullah Khan, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten
Abstract: This work proposes a framework for the robust design of UAV-assisted wireless networks that combine 3D trajectory optimization with user mobility prediction to address dynamic resource allocation challenges. We proposed a sparse second-order prediction model for real-time user tracking coupled with heuristic user clustering to balance service quality and computational complexity. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum rate. It is then decomposed into user association, 3D trajectory design, and resource allocation subproblems, which are solved iteratively via successive convex approximation (SCA). Extensive simulations demonstrate: (1) near-optimal performance with $\epsilon \approx 0.67\%$ deviation from upper-bound solutions, (2) $16\%$ higher minimum rates for distant users compared to non-predictive 3D designs, and (3) $10-30\%$ faster outage mitigation than time-division benchmarks. The framework's adaptive speed control enables precise mobile user tracking while maintaining energy efficiency under constrained flight time. Results demonstrate superior robustness in edge-coverage scenarios, making it particularly suitable for $5G/6G$ networks.

Title: The Efficacy of Semantics-Preserving Transformations in Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Ultrasound
Authors: Blake VanBerlo, Alexander Wong, Jesse Hoey, Robert Arntfield
Abstract: Data augmentation is a central component of joint embedding self-supervised learning (SSL). Approaches that work for natural images may not always be effective in medical imaging tasks. This study systematically investigated the impact of data augmentation and preprocessing strategies in SSL for lung ultrasound. Three data augmentation pipelines were assessed: (1) a baseline pipeline commonly used across imaging domains, (2) a novel semantic-preserving pipeline designed for ultrasound, and (3) a distilled set of the most effective transformations from both pipelines. Pretrained models were evaluated on multiple classification tasks: B-line detection, pleural effusion detection, and COVID-19 classification. Experiments revealed that semantics-preserving data augmentation resulted in the greatest performance for COVID-19 classification - a diagnostic task requiring global image context. Cropping-based methods yielded the greatest performance on the B-line and pleural effusion object classification tasks, which require strong local pattern recognition. Lastly, semantics-preserving ultrasound image preprocessing resulted in increased downstream performance for multiple tasks. Guidance regarding data augmentation and preprocessing strategies was synthesized for practitioners working with SSL in ultrasound.

Title: A brain-inspired generative model for EEG-based cognitive state identification
Authors: Bin Hu, Zhi-Hong Guan
Abstract: This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: EEG classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets with different sampling rates demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern. Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has shown great promise in helping ecologists understand the health of animal populations and ecosystems. However, extracting insights from millions of hours of audio recordings requires the development of specialized recognizers. This is typically a challenging task, necessitating large amounts of training data and machine learning expertise. In this work, we introduce a general, scalable and data-efficient system for developing recognizers for novel bioacoustic problems in under an hour. Our system consists of several key components that tackle problems in previous bioacoustic workflows: 1) highly generalizable acoustic embeddings pre-trained for birdsong classification minimize data hunger; 2) indexed audio search allows the efficient creation of classifier training datasets, and 3) precomputation of embeddings enables an efficient active learning loop, improving classifier quality iteratively with minimal wait time. Ecologists employed our system in three novel case studies: analyzing coral reef health through unidentified sounds; identifying juvenile Hawaiian bird calls to quantify breeding success and improve endangered species monitoring; and Christmas Island bird occupancy modeling. We augment the case studies with simulated experiments which explore the range of design decisions in a structured way and help establish best practices. Altogether these experiments showcase our system's scalability, efficiency, and generalizability, enabling scientists to quickly address new bioacoustic challenges.

Title: DeepMultiConnectome: Deep Multi-Task Prediction of Structural Connectomes Directly from Diffusion MRI Tractography
Authors: Marcus J. Vroemen, Yuqian Chen, Yui Lo, Tengfei Xue, Weidong Cai, Fan Zhang, Josien P.W. Pluim, Lauren J. O'Donnell
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Title: Occlusion-Aware Ground Target Tracking by a Dubins Vehicle using Visibility Volumes
Authors: Collin Hague, Artur Wolek
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of tracking a point of interest (POI) moving along a known trajectory on the ground with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) modeled as a Dubins vehicle using a line-of-sight (LOS) sensor through an urban environment that may occlude the POI. A visibility volume (VV) encodes a time-varying, three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular POI position. A constant-altitude, translating, and radially time-varying circular standoff orbit is then inscribed within the dynamically changing VV centered at the POI position. The time-varying VV is approximated by placing static VVs along the POI's trajectory using an adaptive metric that restricts the volume change of consecutive VVs to below a specified rate. The time-varying circular standoff orbit is proven to be feasible for a Dubins vehicle and approximated with a piecewise set of linearly interpolated circular orbits inside the static VVs. A steering controller is derived that drives the UAV to the time-varying standoff orbit. Numerical simulations and a flight test illustrate the proposed approach.

Title: TADA: Training-free Attribution and Out-of-Domain Detection of Audio Deepfakes
Authors: Adriana Stan, David Combei, Dan Oneata, Horia Cucu
Abstract: Deepfake detection has gained significant attention across audio, text, and image modalities, with high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake. However, identifying the exact source--such as the system or model behind a deepfake--remains a less studied problem. In this paper, we take a significant step forward in audio deepfake model attribution or source tracing by proposing a training-free, green AI approach based entirely on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Leveraging a pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) model, we show that grouping samples from the same generator is straightforward--we obtain an 0.93 F1-score across five deepfake datasets. The method also demonstrates strong out-of-domain (OOD) detection, effectively identifying samples from unseen models at an F1-score of 0.84. We further analyse these results in a multi-dimensional approach and provide additional insights. All code and data protocols used in this work are available in our open repository: this https URL.

Title: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for RIS-aided Fair Communications
Authors: Alex Pierron, Michel Barbeau, Luca De Cicco, Jose Rubio-Hernan, Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.

Title: Multi-Distillation from Speech and Music Representation Models
Authors: Jui-Chiang Wei, Yi-Cheng Lin, Fabian Ritter-Gutierrez, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Real-world audio often mixes speech and music, yet models typically handle only one domain. This paper introduces a multi-teacher distillation framework that unifies speech and music models into a single one while significantly reducing model size. Our approach leverages the strengths of domain-specific teacher models, such as HuBERT for speech and MERT for music, and explores various strategies to balance both domains. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that our model matches the performance of domain-specific models, showing the effectiveness of cross-domain distillation. Additionally, we conduct few-shot learning experiments, highlighting the need for general models in real-world scenarios where labeled data is limited. Our results show that our model not only performs on par with specialized models but also outperforms them in few-shot scenarios, proving that a cross-domain approach is essential and effective for diverse tasks with limited data.

Title: Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of AoA Estimation in Single-Anchor 5G Uplink Positioning
Authors: Thodoris Spanos, Fran Fabra, José A. López-Salcedo, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Nikos Kanistras, Ivan Lapin, Vassilis Paliouras
Abstract: As we move towards 6G, the demand for high-precision, cost-effective positioning solutions becomes increasingly critical. Single-anchor positioning offers a promising alternative to traditional multi-anchor approaches, particularly in complex propagation environments where infrastructure costs and deployment constraints present significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of key algorithmic choices in the development of a single-anchor 5G uplink positioning testbed. Our developed testbed uses angle of arrival (AoA) estimation combined with range measurements from an ultra-wideband pair, to derive the position. The simulations conducted assess the impact of the selected algorithms on channel order and AoA estimation, while the influence of antenna calibration errors on AoA estimation is also examined. Finally, we compare simulations and results obtained from our developed platform.

Title: Feasibility Study of CNNs and MLPs for Radiation Heat Transfer in 2-D Furnaces with Spectrally Participative Gases
Authors: Axel TahmasebiMoradi, Vincent Ren, Benjamin Le-Creurer, Chetra Mang, Mouadh Yagoubi
Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy. Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures. Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the model behavior.

Title: Toward Low-Altitude Airspace Management and UAV Operations: Requirements, Architecture and Enabling Technologies
Authors: Guiyang Luo, Jinglin Li, Qixun Zhang, Zhiyong Feng, Quan Yuan, Yijing Lin, Hui Zhang, Nan Cheng, Ping Zhang
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly advancing toward intelligence, connectivity, and coordination, bringing new challenges in dynamic airspace management, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation, and security management. Existing systems remain fragmented and lack effective coordination. To bridge these gaps, we propose UTICN (Ubiquitous and Trusted Intelligent Cellular-native Network) for LAE, a unified cellular-native architecture that integrates multi-domain sensing, high-precision positioning, intelligent aircraft-to-everything communication, dynamic airspace management, and UAV operational services. UTICN introduces key technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), passive and active positioning, intelligent machine communication, swarm coordination, and control-data decoupled management frameworks. We demonstrate UTICN's feasibility through two use cases, i.e., a city-level LAE management platform and a multi-frequency collaborative ISAC system. This work provides a fundamental reference for building a unified operational foundation and airspace management architecture for the LAE.

Title: Efficient Uncertainty Propagation with Guarantees in Wasserstein Distance
Authors: Eduardo Figueiredo, Steven Adams, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani, Luca Laurenti
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of propagating an uncertain distribution by a possibly non-linear function and quantifying the resulting uncertainty. We measure the uncertainty using the Wasserstein distance, and for a given input set of distributions close in the Wasserstein distance, we compute a set of distributions centered at a discrete distribution that is guaranteed to contain the pushforward of any distribution in the input set. Our approach is based on approximating a nominal distribution from the input set to a discrete support distribution for which the exact computation of the pushforward distribution is tractable, thus guaranteeing computational efficiency to our approach. Then, we rely on results from semi-discrete optimal transport and distributional robust optimization to show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ the error introduced by our approach can be made smaller than $\epsilon$. Critically, in the context of dynamical systems, we show how our results allow one to efficiently approximate the distribution of a stochastic dynamical system with a discrete support distribution for a possibly infinite horizon while bounding the resulting approximation error. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our framework on various benchmarks, including a 10-D non-linear system, showing the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying uncertainty in linear and non-linear stochastic systems.

Title: Minimal Order Recovery through Rank-adaptive Identification
Authors: Frédéric Zheng, Yassir Jedra, Alexandre Proutière
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying linear systems from noisy input-output trajectories. We introduce Thresholded Ho-Kalman, an algorithm that leverages a rank-adaptive procedure to estimate a Hankel-like matrix associated with the system. This approach optimally balances the trade-off between accurately inferring key singular values and minimizing approximation errors for the rest. We establish finite-sample Frobenius norm error bounds for the estimated Hankel matrix. Our algorithm further recovers both the system order and its Markov parameters, and we provide upper bounds for the sample complexity required to identify the system order and finite-time error bounds for estimating the Markov parameters. Interestingly, these bounds match those achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms that assume prior knowledge of the system order.

Title: The envelope of a complex Gaussian random variable
Authors: Sattwik Ghosal, Ranjan Maitra
Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.

Title: Speech Synthesis By Unrolling Diffusion Process using Neural Network Layers
Authors: Peter Ochieng
Abstract: This work introduces UDPNet, a novel architecture designed to accelerate the reverse diffusion process in speech synthesis. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on timestep embeddings and shared network parameters, UDPNet unrolls the reverse diffusion process directly into the network architecture, with successive layers corresponding to equally spaced steps in the diffusion schedule. Each layer progressively refines the noisy input, culminating in a high-fidelity estimation of the original data, \(x_0\). Additionally, we redefine the learning target by predicting latent variables instead of the conventional \(x_0\) or noise \(\epsilon_0\). This shift addresses the common issue of large prediction errors in early denoising stages, effectively reducing speech distortion. Extensive evaluations on single- and multi-speaker datasets demonstrate that UDPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency, while generalizing effectively to unseen speech. These results position UDPNet as a robust solution for real-time speech synthesis applications. Sample audio is available at this https URL.

Title: Byzantine-Resilient Decentralized Multi-Armed Bandits
Authors: Jingxuan Zhu, Alec Koppel, Alvaro Velasquez, Ji Liu
Abstract: In decentralized cooperative multi-armed bandits (MAB), each agent observes a distinct stream of rewards, and seeks to exchange information with others to select a sequence of arms so as to minimize its regret. Agents in the cooperative setting can outperform a single agent running a MAB method such as Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) independently. In this work, we study how to recover such salient behavior when an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, that is, communicate arbitrarily wrong information in the form of reward mean-estimates or confidence sets. This framework can be used to model attackers in computer networks, instigators of offensive content into recommender systems, or manipulators of financial markets. Our key contribution is the development of a fully decentralized resilient upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that fuses an information mixing step among agents with a truncation of inconsistent and extreme values. This truncation step enables us to establish that the performance of each normal agent is no worse than the classic single-agent UCB1 algorithm in terms of regret, and more importantly, the cumulative regret of all normal agents is strictly better than the non-cooperative case, provided that each agent has at least 3f+1 neighbors where f is the maximum possible Byzantine agents in each agent's neighborhood. Extensions to time-varying neighbor graphs, and minimax lower bounds are further established on the achievable regret. Experiments corroborate the merits of this framework in practice.

Title: Electroencephalogram Emotion Recognition via AUC Maximization
Authors: Minheng Xiao
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges in areas including neuroscience, cognitive science, and medical diagnostics, where accurately detecting minority classes is essential for robust model performance. This study addresses the issue of class imbalance, using the `Liking' label in the DEAP dataset as an example. Such imbalances are often overlooked by prior research, which typically focuses on the more balanced arousal and valence labels and predominantly uses accuracy metrics to measure model performance. To tackle this issue, we adopt numerical optimization techniques aimed at maximizing the area under the curve (AUC), thus enhancing the detection of underrepresented classes. Our approach, which begins with a linear classifier, is compared against traditional linear classifiers, including logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Our method significantly outperforms these models, increasing recall from 41.6\% to 79.7\% and improving the F1-score from 0.506 to 0.632. These results highlight the efficacy of AUC maximization via numerical optimization in managing imbalanced datasets, providing an effective solution for enhancing predictive accuracy in detecting minority but crucial classes in out-of-sample datasets.

Title: Annotation-Free MIDI-to-Audio Synthesis via Concatenative Synthesis and Generative Refinement
Authors: Osamu Take, Taketo Akama
Abstract: Recent MIDI-to-audio synthesis methods using deep neural networks have successfully generated high-quality, expressive instrumental tracks. However, these methods require MIDI annotations for supervised training, limiting the diversity of instrument timbres and expression styles in the output. We propose CoSaRef, a MIDI-to-audio synthesis method that does not require MIDI-audio paired datasets. CoSaRef first generates a synthetic audio track using concatenative synthesis based on MIDI input, then refines it with a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on datasets without MIDI annotations. This approach improves the diversity of timbres and expression styles. Additionally, it allows detailed control over timbres and expression through audio sample selection and extra MIDI design, similar to traditional functions in digital audio workstations. Experiments showed that CoSaRef could generate realistic tracks while preserving fine-grained timbre control via one-shot samples. Moreover, despite not being supervised on MIDI annotation, CoSaRef outperformed the state-of-the-art timbre-controllable method based on MIDI supervision in both objective and subjective evaluation.

Title: Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers
Authors: Julian Heinovski, Doğanalp Ergenç, Kirsten Thommes, Falko Dressler
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback
Authors: Namhyun Kim, Juntaek Han, Jinseok Choi, Ahmed Alkhateeb, Chan-Byoung Chae, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To obtain the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed DL CSI, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. Leveraging this, to mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) aided precoder optimization method. This method jointly updates the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.

Title: Neuromorphic Optical Tracking and Imaging of Randomly Moving Targets through Strongly Scattering Media
Authors: Ning Zhang, Timothy Shea, Arto Nurmikko
Abstract: Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.

Title: AAD-LLM: Neural Attention-Driven Auditory Scene Understanding
Authors: Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Vishal Choudhari, Stephan Bickel, Ashesh Mehta, Guy M McKhann, Daniel Friedman, Adeen Flinker, Nima Mesgarani
Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

Title: Weakly Supervised Multiple Instance Learning for Whale Call Detection and Temporal Localization in Long-Duration Passive Acoustic Monitoring
Authors: Ragib Amin Nihal, Benjamin Yen, Runwu Shi, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: Marine ecosystem monitoring via Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) generates vast data, but deep learning often requires precise annotations and short segments. We introduce DSMIL-LocNet, a Multiple Instance Learning framework for whale call detection and localization using only bag-level labels. Our dual-stream model processes 2-30 minute audio segments, leveraging spectral and temporal features with attention-based instance selection. Tests on Antarctic whale data show longer contexts improve classification (F1: 0.8-0.9) while medium instances ensure localization precision (0.65-0.70). This suggests MIL can enhance scalable marine monitoring. Code: this https URL

Title: SACA: A Scenario-Aware Collision Avoidance Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Integrating LLMs-Driven Reasoning
Authors: Shiyue Zhao, Junzhi Zhang, Neda Masoud, Heye Huang, Xiaohui Hou, Chengkun He
Abstract: Reliable collision avoidance under extreme situations remains a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, their application in safety-critical evasive maneuvers is limited by latency and robustness issues. Even so, LLMs stand out for their ability to weigh emotional, legal, and ethical factors, enabling socially responsible and context-aware collision avoidance. This paper proposes a scenario-aware collision avoidance (SACA) framework for extreme situations by integrating predictive scenario evaluation, data-driven reasoning, and scenario-preview-based deployment to improve collision avoidance decision-making. SACA consists of three key components. First, a predictive scenario analysis module utilizes obstacle reachability analysis and motion intention prediction to construct a comprehensive situational prompt. Second, an online reasoning module refines decision-making by leveraging prior collision avoidance knowledge and fine-tuning with scenario data. Third, an offline evaluation module assesses performance and stores scenarios in a memory bank. Additionally, A precomputed policy method improves deployability by previewing scenarios and retrieving or reasoning policies based on similarity and confidence levels. Real-vehicle tests show that, compared with baseline methods, SACA effectively reduces collision losses in extreme high-risk scenarios and lowers false triggering under complex conditions.

Title: Design and Validation of an Intention-Aware Probabilistic Framework for Trajectory Prediction: Integrating COLREGS, Grounding Hazards, and Planned Routes
Authors: Dhanika Mahipala, Trym Tengesdal, Børge Rokseth, Tor Arne Johansen
Abstract: Collision avoidance capability is an essential component in an autonomous vessel navigation system. To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

Authors: Cihan Xiao, Ruixing Liang, Xiangyu Zhang, Mehmet Emre Tiryaki, Veronica Bae, Lavanya Shankar, Rong Yang, Ethan Poon, Emmanuel Dupoux, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Leibny Paola Garcia Perera
Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our dataset with 100+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.

Title: LID Models are Actually Accent Classifiers: Implications and Solutions for LID on Accented Speech
Authors: Niyati Bafna, Matthew Wiesner
Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking. (iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

Title: NTPP: Generative Speech Language Modeling for Dual-Channel Spoken Dialogue via Next-Token-Pair Prediction
Authors: Qichao Wang, Ziqiao Meng, Wenqian Cui, Yifei Zhang, Pengcheng Wu, Bingzhe Wu, Irwin King, Liang Chen, Peilin Zhao
Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

Title: Fourier-Modulated Implicit Neural Representation for Multispectral Satellite Image Compression
Authors: Woojin Cho, Steve Andreas Immanuel, Junhyuk Heo, Darongsae Kwon
Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.

Title: Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight Architecture DDPM
Authors: Xun Li, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

Title: An introduction to pitch strength in contemporary popular music analysis and production
Authors: Emmanuel Deruty
Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production. Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a perspective of perceptual richness.

Title: Towards Energy-Efficient and Low-Latency Voice-Controlled Smart Homes: A Proposal for Offline Speech Recognition and IoT Integration
Authors: Peng Huang, Imdad Ullah, Xiaotong Wei, Tariq Ahamed Ahanger, Najm Hassan, Zawar Hussain Shah
Abstract: The smart home systems, based on AI speech recognition and IoT technology, enable people to control devices through verbal commands and make people's lives more efficient. However, existing AI speech recognition services are primarily deployed on cloud platforms on the Internet. When users issue a command, speech recognition devices like ``Amazon Echo'' will post a recording through numerous network nodes, reach multiple servers, and then receive responses through the Internet. This mechanism presents several issues, including unnecessary energy consumption, communication latency, and the risk of a single-point failure. In this position paper, we propose a smart home concept based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology: 1) integrating offline keyword spotting (KWS) technologies into household appliances with limited resource hardware to enable them to understand user voice commands; 2) designing a local IoT network with decentralized architecture to manage and connect various devices, enhancing the robustness and scalability of the system. This proposal of a smart home based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology will allow users to use low-latency voice control anywhere in the home without depending on the Internet and provide better scalability and energy sustainability.

Title: Versatile Loco-Manipulation through Flexible Interlimb Coordination
Authors: Xinghao Zhu, Yuxin Chen, Lingfeng Sun, Farzad Niroui, Simon Le Cleac'h, Jiuguang Wang, Kuan Fang
Abstract: The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential for enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or predetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement Learning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile loco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving a success rate of 78.9% on average.

Title: Teaching Physical Awareness to LLMs through Sounds
Authors: Weiguo Wang, Andy Nie, Wenrui Zhou, Yi Kai, Chengchen Hu
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound, focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

Title: Auto-Regressive vs Flow-Matching: a Comparative Study of Modeling Paradigms for Text-to-Music Generation
Authors: Or Tal, Felix Kreuk, Yossi Adi
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.
