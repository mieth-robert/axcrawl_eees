Title: DiffPace: Diffusion-based Plug-and-play Augmented Channel Estimation in mmWave and Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Zhengdong Hu, Chong Han, Wolfgang Gerstacker, Robert Schober
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures, leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach, it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method. Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance, attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced computational efficiency.

Title: Affordable EEG, Actionable Insights: An Open Dataset and Evaluation Framework for Epilepsy Patient Stratification
Authors: HM Shadman Tabib, Md. Hasnaen Adil, Ayesha Rahman, Ahmmad Nur Swapnil, Maoyejatun Hasana, Ahmed Hossain Chowdhury, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam
Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel, consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy, inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer interaction, and machine learning, advancing the goal of affordable and actionable EEG-based epilepsy care.

Title: Gas Fire Power Plant Management Through Numerical Approximation of Spark Spread Options
Authors: Babacar Seck, Anas Abdullah
Abstract: Cross-commodity valuation approaches to value gas fire power plants are well studied in the literature. Hence, the value of the gas fire power plant is identical to the value of a spark spread option wherein the underlying are electricity and gas with a strike price assimilated to operating and maintenance costs. Power and fuels spot prices account for uncertain futures cash-flows for power-plant generator owners. For instance, for gas-fired turbine plant, spot prices of electricity and gas determine the random cash-flows of the power-plant. Other than the spot prices, the valuation of such plant involves among other deterministic cost the plant heat rate and operating costs. Recently, the cost of emissions is considered into the valuation to tackle environmental issues. Given some simplifications in the plant cash-flow modelling, the value of such plant can either be expressed as the price of i) a cross-commodity option or ii) the price of a real option. Here, we focus on cross-commodity option valuation approach where the value of the power plant is approached as the value of a spark spread option. When spot prices of the underlying commodities are log-normal, closed formulae or approximations can be obtained using Kirk's approximation. Naturally, the spot price of electricity and gas present spikes due to seasonality among other factors. However, in that case it is not possible to get a closed formula for the spark spread option. In this paper we explore possibilities to approximate spark spread options when spot prices fall into a class of jump diffusion processes.

Title: Design of an M-ary Chaos Shift Keying System Using Combined Chaotic Systems
Authors: Tingting Huang, Jundong Chen, Huanqiang Zeng, Guofa Cai, Haoyu Zhou
Abstract: In traditional chaos shift keying (CSK) communication systems, implementing chaotic synchronization techniques is costly but practically unattainable in a noisy environment. This paper proposes a combined chaotic sequences-based $M$-ary CSK (CCS-$M$-CSK) system that eliminates the need for chaotic synchronization. At the transmitter, the chaotic sequence is constructed by combining two chaotic segments of different lengths, where each is generated from distinct chaotic systems and only one kind of chaotic segment modulates the information signal. At the receiver, a deep learning unit with binary classification is meticulously designed to recover information symbols. The symbol error rate (SER) performance of the proposed system is evaluated over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Specifically, the impact of varying misalignment lengths on the SER performance of the system is analyzed when the received sequence is misaligned. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrates significant performance advantages over existing CSK-based systems in multipath Rayleigh fading channels. These features establish CCS-$M$-CSK as a promising candidate for various applications, including Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).

Title: Autonomous Vehicle front steering control computation saving
Authors: Julián Salt Llobregat, Julián Salt Ducajú
Abstract: For autonomous vehicles lane keeping purposes it is crucial to control the vehicle yaw rate. As it is known a vehicle yaw rate control can be achieved handling the steering angle. One option is to consider a robust controller and depending of the requirements the synthesis can drive to a high order controller. Nowadays this kind of vehicles needs a networked based control (IVN -Intelligent Vehicle Network-)with a considerable amount of control loops for different vehicle components. Therefore, in this environment the controllers computation saving could be a good option for unload the network and digital processors. That is the main target of this contribution; in order to accomplish this goal a interlacing implementation technique is considered. Results in a real path tracking illustrates viability of this procedure.

Title: A Comparison of Road Grade Preview Signals from Lidar and Maps
Authors: Logan Schexnaydre, Aman Poovalappil, Darrell Robinette, Jeremy Bos
Abstract: Road grade can impact the energy efficiency, safety, and comfort associated with automated vehicle control systems. Currently, control systems that attempt to compensate for road grade are designed with one of two assumptions. Either the grade is only known once the vehicle is driving over the road segment through proprioception, or complete knowledge of the oncoming road grade is known from a pre-made map. Both assumptions limit the performance of a control system, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation, whereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to missing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the oncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use point returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint along a path. The estimated grade is defined as the difference in height between the front and rear wheelbase at a given waypoint. Kalman filtering techniques are used to mitigate the effects of odometry and motion uncertainty on the grade estimates. This estimator's performance is compared to the measurements of a map created with a GNSS/INS system via a field experiment. When compared to the map-based system, the lidar-based estimator produces an unbiased error with a standard deviation of 0.6 degrees at an average range of 52.7 meters. By having similar precision to map-based systems, automotive lidar-based grade estimation systems are shown to be a valid approach for measuring road grade when a map is unavailable or inaccurate. In using lidar as an input signal for grade-based control system tasks, autonomous vehicles achieve higher redundancy and independence in contrast to existing methods.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-flow Routing in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks
Authors: Brian Kim, Justin H. Kong, Terrence J. Moore, Fikadu T. Dagefu
Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), where devices with diverse communication technologies coexist, there is increasing demand for efficient and adaptive multi-hop routing with multiple data flows. Traditional routing methods, designed for homogeneous environments, fail to address the complexity introduced by links consisting of multiple technologies, frequency-dependent fading, and dynamic topology changes. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing framework using deep Q-networks (DQN) to establish routes between multiple source-destination pairs in HWNs by enabling each node to jointly select a communication technology, a subband, and a next hop relay that maximizes the rate of the route. Our approach incorporates channel and interference-aware neighbor selection approaches to improve decision-making beyond conventional distance-based heuristics. We further evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method under varying network dynamics, including node mobility, changes in node density, and the number of data flows. Simulation results demonstrate that our DRL-based routing framework significantly enhances scalability, adaptability, and end-to-end throughput in complex HWN scenarios.

Title: Opto-Electronic Convolutional Neural Network Design Via Direct Kernel Optimization
Authors: Ali Almuallem, Harshana Weligampola, Abhiram Gnanasambandam, Wei Xu, Dilshan Godaliyadda, Hamid R. Sheikh, Stanley H. Chan, Qi Guo
Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs): first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage design achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training under the same training time and resource constraints.

Title: Neural Network based Distance Estimation for Branched Molecular Communication Systems
Authors: Martín Schottlender, Maximilian Schäfer, Ricardo A. Veiga
Abstract: Molecular Communications (MC) is an emerging research paradigm that utilizes molecules to transmit information, with promising applications in biomedicine such as targeted drug delivery or tumor detection. It is also envisioned as a key enabler of the Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). In this paper, we propose algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the estimation of communication channel parameters in MC systems. We focus on a simple branched topology, simulating the molecule movement with a macroscopic MC simulator. The Deep Learning architectures proposed for distance estimation demonstrate strong performance within these branched environments, highlighting their potential for future MC applications.

Title: Recurrence Plot and Change Quantile-based Deep Supervised and Semi-supervised Protection for Transmission Lines Connected to Photovoltaic Plants
Authors: Pallav Kumar Bera, Samita Rani Pani
Abstract: Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines (TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program (PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system, with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise, series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT) saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the approach is effective in handling different system configurations and conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.

Title: Second-Order Policy Gradient Methods for the Linear Quadratic Regulator
Authors: Amirreza Valaei, Arash Bahari Kordabad, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: Policy gradient methods are a powerful family of reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous control that optimize a policy directly. However, standard first-order methods often converge slowly. Second-order methods can accelerate learning by using curvature information, but they are typically expensive to compute. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a practical setting in which key quantities, such as the policy gradient, admit closed-form expressions. In this work, we develop second-order policy gradient algorithms for LQR by deriving explicit formulas for both the approximate and exact Hessians used in Gauss--Newton and Newton methods, respectively. Numerical experiments show a faster convergence rate for the proposed second-order approach over the standard first-order policy gradient baseline.

Title: Toward Objective and Interpretable Prosody Evaluation in Text-to-Speech: A Linguistically Motivated Approach
Authors: Cedric Chan, Jianjing Kuang
Abstract: Prosody is essential for speech technology, shaping comprehension, naturalness, and expressiveness. However, current text-to-speech (TTS) systems still struggle to accurately capture human-like prosodic variation, in part because existing evaluation methods for prosody remain limited. Traditional metrics like Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and offer little insight into why a system sounds unnatural. This study introduces a linguistically informed, semi-automatic framework for evaluating TTS prosody through a two-tier architecture that mirrors human prosodic organization. The method uses quantitative linguistic criteria to evaluate synthesized speech against human speech corpora across multiple acoustic dimensions. By integrating discrete and continuous prosodic measures, it provides objective and interpretable metrics of both event placement and cue realization, while accounting for the natural variability observed across speakers and prosodic cues. Results show strong correlations with perceptual MOS ratings while revealing model-specific weaknesses that traditional perceptual tests alone cannot capture. This approach provides a principled path toward diagnosing, benchmarking, and ultimately improving the prosodic naturalness of next-generation TTS systems.

Title: CNN-Based Detection of Mixed-Molecule Concentrations in Molecular Communication
Authors: Vivien Walter, Dadi Bi, Daniel L. Ruiz Blanco, Yansha Deng
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a promising paradigm for applications where traditional electromagnetic communications are impractical. However, decoding chemical signals, especially in multi-transmitter systems, remains a key challenge due to interference and complex propagation dynamics. In this paper, we develop a one-dimensional fractal convolutional neural network (fCNN) to detect the concentrations of multiple types of molecules based on the absorbance spectra measured at a receiver. Our model is trained by both experimental and simulated datasets, with the latter enhanced by noise modeling to mimic real-world measurements. We demonstrate that a noiseaugmented simulated dataset can effectively be a substitute for experimental data, achieving similar decoding accuracy. Our approach successfully detects bit sequences in both binary and quadruple concentration shift keying (BCSK and QCSK) scenarios, even when transmitters are desynchronized, highlighting the potential of machine learning for robust MC signal detection.

Title: Hopfield Neural Networks for Online Constrained Parameter Estimation with Time-Varying Dynamics and Disturbances
Authors: Miguel Pedro Silva
Abstract: This paper proposes two projector-based Hopfield neural network (HNN) estimators for online, constrained parameter estimation under time-varying data, additive disturbances, and slowly drifting physical parameters. The first is a constraint-aware HNN that enforces linear equalities and inequalities (via slack neurons) and continuously tracks the constrained least-squares target. The second augments the state with compensation neurons and a concatenated regressor to absorb bias-like disturbance components within the same energy function. For both estimators we establish global uniform ultimate boundedness with explicit convergence rate and ultimate bound, and we derive practical tuning rules that link the three design gains to closed-loop bandwidth and steady-state accuracy. We also introduce an online identifiability monitor that adapts the constraint weight and time step, and, when needed, projects updates onto identifiable subspaces to prevent drift in poorly excited directions...

Title: Model Predictive Control with Multiple Constraint Horizons
Authors: Allan Andre do Nascimento, Han Wang, Antonis Papachristodoulou, Kostas Margellos
Abstract: In this work we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation that splits constraints in two different types. Motivated by safety considerations, the first type of constraint enforces a control-invariant set, while the second type could represent a less restrictive constraint on the system state. This distinction enables closed-loop sub- optimality results for nonlinear MPC with heterogeneous state constraints (distinct constraints across open loop predicted states), and no terminal elements. Removing the non-invariant constraint recovers the partially constrained case. Beyond its theoretical interest, heterogeneous constrained MPC shows how constraint choices shape the system's closed loop. In the partially constrained case, adjusting the constraint horizon (how many predicted- state constraints are enforced) trades estimation accuracy for computational cost. Our analysis yields first, a sub- optimality upper-bound accounting for distinct constraint sets, their horizons and decay rates, that is tighter for short horizons than prior work. Second, to our knowledge, we give the first lower bound (beyond open-loop cost) on closed-loop sub-optimality. Together these bounds provide a powerful analysis framework, allowing designers to evaluate the effect of horizons in MPC sub-optimality. We demonstrate our results via simulations on nonlinear and linear safety-critical systems.

Title: Online Distributed Zeroth-Order Optimization With Non-Zero-Mean Adverse Noises
Authors: Yanfu Qin, Kaihong Lu
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of online distributed zeroth-order optimization subject to a set constraint is studied via a multi-agent network, where each agent can communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. Different from the existing works on online distributed zeroth- order optimization, we consider the case where the estimate on the gradients are influenced by some non-zero-mean adverse noises. To handle this problem, we propose a new online dis- tributed zeroth-order mirror descent algorithm involving a kernel function-based estimator and a clipped strategy. Particularly, in the estimator, the kernel function-based strategy is provided to deal with the adverse noises, and eliminate the low-order terms in the Taylor expansions of the objective functions. Furthermore, the performance of the presented algorithm is measured by employing the dynamic regrets, where the offline benchmarks are to find the optimal point at each time. Under the mild assumptions on the graph and the objective functions, we prove that if the variation in the optimal point sequence grows at a certain rate, then the high probability bound of the dynamic regrets increases sublinearly. Finally, a simulation experiment is worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Title: A Reliability-Cost Optimization Framework for EV and DER Integration in Standard and Reconfigurable Distribution Network Topologies
Authors: Rida Fatima, Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption poses operational and economic challenges for power distribution systems, including increased line loading levels and network congestions. This may require potential infrastructure reinforcement and expansion. As a fast inexpensive alternative solution, network topology reconfiguration (NTR) offers a practical means to redistribute power flows, reduce operational costs, and defer infrastructure upgrades. This paper presents a linear programming framework to evaluate the impact of varying EV penetration on operational costs under four configurations: standard distribution network (SDN), SDN with NTR (SDNTR), SDN with distributed energy resources (SDN-DER), and SDNTR with DERs (SDNTR-DER). Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus system. The analysis demonstrates that integrating DERs reduces operational costs, while NTR further enhances system flexibility, enabling higher EV penetration levels without compromising feasibility. The combined SDNTR-DER approach offers the most cost-effective and reliable pathway for accommodating future EV growth while mitigating the need for immediate infrastructure upgrades.

Title: From the perspective of perceptual speech quality: The robustness of frequency bands to noise
Authors: Junyi Fan, Donald S. Williamson
Abstract: Speech quality is one of the main foci of speech-related research, where it is frequently studied with speech intelligibility, another essential measurement. Band-level perceptual speech intelligibility, however, has been studied frequently, whereas speech quality has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this paper, a Multiple Stimuli With Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) inspired approach was proposed to study the individual robustness of frequency bands to noise with perceptual speech quality as the measure. Speech signals were filtered into thirty-two frequency bands with compromising real-world noise employed at different signal-to-noise ratios. Robustness to noise indices of individual frequency bands was calculated based on the human-rated perceptual quality scores assigned to the reconstructed noisy speech signals. Trends in the results suggest the mid-frequency region appeared less robust to noise in terms of perceptual speech quality. These findings suggest future research aiming at improving speech quality should pay more attention to the mid-frequency region of the speech signals accordingly.

Title: DL-Based Beam Management for mmWave Vehicular Networks Exploring Temporal Correlation
Authors: Ailton Oliveira, Amir Khatibi, Daniel Suzuki, Ilan Correa, José Rezende, Aldebaro Klautau
Abstract: Millimeter wave communications are essential for modern wireless networks. It supports high data rates but suffers from severe path loss, which requires precise beam alignment to maintain reliable links. This beam management is particularly challenging in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicle-to-infrastructure, and several methods have been presented. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based beam tracking framework that combines a position-aware beam pre-selection strategy with sequential prediction using recurrent neural networks. The proposed architecture can support deep learning models trained for both classification and regression. In contrast to many existing studies that evaluate beam tracking under predominantly line-of-sight (LOS) conditions, our work explicitly includes highly challenging non-LOS scenarios - with up to 50% non-LOS incidence in certain datasets - to rigorously assess model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high top-K accuracy, even under adverse conditions, while reducing the beam measurement overhead by up to 50%.

Title: Augmenting Open-Vocabulary Dysarthric Speech Assessment with Human Perceptual Supervision
Authors: Kaimeng Jia, Minzhu Tu, Zengrui Jin, Siyin Wang, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Dysarthria is a speech disorder characterized by impaired intelligibility and reduced communicative effectiveness. Automatic dysarthria assessment provides a scalable, cost-effective approach for supporting the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. This study investigates leveraging human perceptual annotations from speech synthesis assessment as reliable out-of-domain knowledge for dysarthric speech assessment. Experimental results suggest that such supervision can yield consistent and substantial performance improvements in self-supervised learning pre-trained models. These findings suggest that perceptual ratings aligned with human judgments from speech synthesis evaluations represent valuable resources for dysarthric speech modeling, enabling effective cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Title: Multiplexing Neural Audio Watermarks
Authors: Zheqi Yuan, Yucheng Huang, Guangzhi Sun, Zengrui Jin, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Audio watermarking is a promising tool to ensure authenticity of speech content. However, existing watermarking methods remain vulnerable to more advanced dilution attacks such as lossy compression and neural reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to multiplex neural audio watermarking techniques to leverage their complementarity under different types of attacks. Specifically, five different multiplexing designs are investigated, including parallel, sequential, frequency-division, time-division and perceptual adaptive time-frequency multiplexing (PA-TFM). We evaluate our multiplexing technique on LibriSpeech data with 11 different attack methods, including 2 new neural reconstruction attacks featuring recent advancements in speech processing. As a result, the proposed PA-TFM as a training-free multiplexing method achieves better performance than single watermarking baselines by clear margins, showcasing a more robust way of using watermarks for audio.

Title: Performance Analysis of NOMA-Assisted Optical OFDM ISAC Systems with Clipping Distortion
Authors: Nam N. Luong, Chuyen T. Nguyen, Thanh V. Pham
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Due to their inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM waveforms are clipped to fit the limited dynamic range of the optical transmitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), resulting in clipping distortion. To alleviate the impact of the distortion, we propose a novel transmitter architecture where the clipping processes are performed before NOMA superposition coding. We then analyze the performance of the proposed optical ISAC systems considering the effects of power allocation and clipping distortion. For the communication subsystem, we analyze the effect of NOMA on the achievable sum rate and bit error rate (BER). For the sensing subsystem, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of estimating the transmission distance accuracy are obtained. Simulation results reveal that allocating more power to the strong user yields a higher sum rate, lower BER, and better sensing performance, whereas a more balanced power allocation among users results in degraded BER and sensing performance.

Title: Constrained Performance Boosting Control for Nonlinear Systems via ADMM
Authors: Gianluca Giacomelli, Danilo Saccani, Siep Weiland, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate, Valentina Breschi
Abstract: We present the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Performance Boosting (ADMM-PB), an approach to design performance boosting controllers for stable or pre-stabilized nonlinear systems, while explicitly seeking input and state constraint satisfaction. Rooted on a recently proposed approach for designing neural-network controllers that guarantees closed-loop stability by design while minimizing generic cost functions, our strategy integrates it within an alternating direction method of multipliers routine to seek constraint handling without modifying the controller structure of the aforementioned seminal strategy. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over a baseline penalizing constraint violation through barrier-like terms in the cost, indicating that ADMM-PB can lead to considerably lower constraint violations at the price of inducing slightly more cautious closed-loop behaviors.

Title: MammoClean: Toward Reproducible and Bias-Aware AI in Mammography through Dataset Harmonization
Authors: Yalda Zafari, Hongyi Pan, Gorkem Durak, Ulas Bagci, Essam A. Rashed, Mohamed Mabrok
Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is publicly available from: this https URL.

Title: LLM4PG: Adapting Large Language Model for Pathloss Map Generation via Synesthesia of Machines
Authors: Mingran Sun, Lu Bai, Xiang Cheng, Jianjun Wu
Abstract: In this paper, a novel large language model (LLM)-based pathloss map generation model, termed LLM4PG, is proposed for sixth-generation (6G) AI-native communication systems via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore the mapping mechanism between sensing images and pathloss maps, a new synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset, SynthSoM-U2G, is constructed, covering multiple scenarios, frequency bands, and flight altitudes. By adapting the LLM for cross-modal pathloss map generation for the first time, LLM4PG establishes an effective cross-domain alignment between the multi-modal sensing-communication and natural language domains. A task-specific fine-tuning strategy with a tailored layer selection and activation scheme is designed to meet the demands of massive-scale, high-quality generation. Compared with conventional deep learning artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) models, LLM4PG achieves more accurate pathloss map generation and stronger generalization across diverse conditions. Results show that LLM4PG attains an NMSE of 0.0454, outperforming the conventional AIGC model by over 2.90 dB, while its cross-condition generalization achieves an NMSE of 0.0492, exceeding the baseline by 4.52 dB.

Title: A Kullback-Leibler divergence method for input-system-state identification
Authors: Marios Impraimakis
Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

Title: Explicit MPC for the constrained zonotope case with low-rank matrix updates
Authors: Stefan S. Mihai, Florin Stoican, Martin Monnigmann, Bogdan D. Ciubotaru
Abstract: Solving the explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem requires enumerating all critical regions and their associated feedback laws, a task that scales exponentially with the system dimension and the prediction horizon, as well. When the problem's constraints are boxes or zonotopes, the feasible domain admits a compact constrained-zonotope representation. Building on this insight, we exploit the geometric properties of the equivalent constrained-zonotope reformulation to accelerate the computation of the explicit solution. Specifically, we formulate the multi-parametric problem in the lifted generator space and solve it using second-order optimality conditions, employ low-rank matrix updates to reduce computation time, and introduce an analytic enumeration of candidate active sets that yields the explicit solution in tree form.

Title: Decentralized Voltage Control of AC Microgrids with Constant Power Loads using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Grigoris Michos, George C. Konstantopoulos
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of constant power loads. Perceiving the load demand as an unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, i.e. uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. The latter captures the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories, for which we prove boundedness via a suitable control barrier function. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law also enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated in a simulation scenario, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.

Title: Adaptive Compressed Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine
Authors: Vered Karp, Aseel Omar, Alejandro Cohen
Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine (IF-TEM) is a power-efficient asynchronous sampler that converts analog signals into non-uniform time-domain samples. Adaptive IF-TEM (AIF-TEM) improves this machine by adapting its process to the characteristics of the input signal, thereby reducing the sampling rate. Compressed IF-TEM (CIF-TEM) reduces bit usage by performing analog compression before quantization. In this paper, we introduce a combined Adaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) -- a new sampler that leverages the two machines, AIF-TEM and CIF-TEM, where each reinforces the effectiveness of the other.

Title: Investigating Brain Connectivity and Information Flow in Mental Workload Using EEG and fNIRS Integration
Authors: Mohaddese Qaremohammadlou, Mohammad Bagher Shamsollahi
Abstract: This study investigates brain connectivity and information flow during mental workload (MWL) by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. Utilizing the N-back task to induce varying levels of MWL in 26 participants, we analyzed both functional and effective connectivity across 25 cortical regions derived from combined EEG and fNIRS signals. Functional connectivity was assessed using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Phase Locking Value (PLV), and Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC), while effective connectivity was evaluated using directed Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) and generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Our findings reveal increased functional connectivity in frontal regions during higher MWL conditions (3-back compared to 0-back). Furthermore, effective connectivity analysis demonstrates a significant directional information flow from EEG to fNIRS, indicating a dominant influence of neural activity on hemodynamic responses. Statistical tests confirm significant differences in connectivity patterns between low and high MWL states. These results underscore the utility of EEG-fNIRS integration for characterizing brain network dynamics under varying cognitive demands and provide insights into neurovascular coupling mechanisms during mental workload.

Title: Generalized Swing Control Framework for Inverter-based Resources
Authors: Rodrigo Bernal, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control framework designed for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), denoted as Generalized Swing Control (GSC). The proposed GSC framework generalizes the definition of Grid-Forming (GFM) control schemes and exploits the coupling between active and reactive power dynamics. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct extensive time-domain simulations and small-signal analysis using a modified version of the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus dynamic model of the all-island Irish transmission system. The case studies focus on evaluating the dynamic performance of the proposed framework under different configurations, including Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM), coupled-VSM and dual-VSM schemes. To address the nonlinear nature of power system dynamics, sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo methods are employed to improve parameter tuning and assess the stability of GSC configurations in the studied systems.

Title: Using ensemble learning with hybrid graph neural networks and transformers to predict traffic in cities
Authors: Ismail Zrigui, Samira Khoulji, Mohamed Larbi Kerkeb
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) still have a hard time accurately predicting traffic in cities, especially in big, multimodal settings with complicated spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.

Title: Coherency among Power System Devices
Authors: Ignacio Ponce, Rodrigo Bernal, Federico Milano
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel general definition of coherency among power system devices of any type. The proposed approach is thus not limited to synchronous machines. With this aim, the paper shows that coherency can be formally based on the difference in the complex frequency of the current injections of any two devices electrically connected to the same grid. The proposed definition is model-agnostic, making it general and suitable for modern power systems composed of a heterogeneous mix of technologies. The paper also provides a systematic analytical procedure to study the properties that specific device models must satisfy to be coherent. Time-domain simulations are conducted in three case studies whose results illustrate the ability of our definition to evaluate coherency among any type of device.

Title: Decentralized Approach to Detect and Eliminate Flapping Phenomena due to Flexible Resources
Authors: Angel Vaca, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized methodology for detecting and mitigating flapping phenomena in power systems, primarily caused by the operation of discrete devices. The proposed approach applies moving-window autocorrelation to local measurements, enabling each device to autonomously identify sustained oscillations. Upon detection, a probabilistic, device-specific mitigation strategy is executed. Flexible demand resources (DFRs), under-load tap changers (ULTCs), and automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) are utilised to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach to both discrete and continuous-operation devices. Results show that the proposed method is robust and properly distinguishes damped oscillations from persistent flapping, allowing devices to independently recognize problematic operating scenarios and implement corrective actions accordingly.

Title: Many-vs-Many Missile Guidance via Virtual Targets
Authors: Marc Schneider, Walter Fichter
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using virtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory predictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets through conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a centralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing probabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is guided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse flight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal interception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as many-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by distributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than pursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across various target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors) demonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line prediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to 5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable effective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing interception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.

Title: Reliability entails input-selective contraction and regulation in excitable networks
Authors: Michelangelo Bin, Alessandro Cecconi, Lorenzo Marconi
Abstract: The animal nervous system offers a model of computation combining digital reliability and analog efficiency. Understanding how this sweet spot can be realized is a core question of neuromorphic engineering. To this aim, this paper explores the connection between reliability, contraction, and regulation in excitable systems. Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable behavior as a proof-of-concept, it is shown that neuronal reliability can be formalized as an average trajectory contraction property induced by the input. In excitable networks, reliability is shown to enable regulation of the network to a robustly stable steady state. It is thus posited that regulation provides a notion of dynamical analog computation, and that stability makes such a computation model robust.

Title: RIS-Assisted 3D Spherical Splatting for Object Composition Visualization using Detection Transformers
Authors: Anastasios T. Sotiropoulos, Stavros Tsimpoukis, Dimitrios Tyrovolas, Sotiris Ioannidis, George K. Karagiannidis, Christos K. Liaskos
Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Title: Analytical Framework for Assessing Effective Regional Inertia
Authors: Bruno Pinheiro, Joe H. Chow, Federico Milano, Daniel Dotta
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formulation of effective regional inertia that explicitly accounts for both system topology and the spatial distribution of inertia. Unlike traditional approaches that model a region as an aggregated machine with an equivalent inertia, the proposed metric provides a topology-aware representation. The methodology builds on an analytical framework that extends classical slow coherency theory to address network partitioning and regional frequency stability. Based on these partitions, we develop a systematic procedure to evaluate the effective inertia of each region, enabling a more accurate interpretation of local inertial contributions, including those from virtual inertia provided by inverter-based resources (IBRs). Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus systems demonstrate that the integration of inertial devices does not uniformly improve system frequency response, underscoring the importance of the proposed metric for effective regional inertia assessment.

Title: Resource-efficient Automatic Refinement of Segmentations via Weak Supervision from Light Feedback
Authors: Alix de Langlais, Benjamin Billot, Théo Aguilar Vidal, Marc-Olivier Gauci, Hervé Delingette
Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis. Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently, a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation time.

Title: ISAC Empowered Air-Sea Collaborative System: A UAV-USV Joint Inspection Framework
Authors: Rui Zhang, Fuwang Dong, Wei Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an air-sea collaborative system framework based on the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) techniques, where the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) jointly inspect targets of interest while keeping communication with each other simultaneously. First, we demonstrate the unique challenges encountered in this collaborative system, i.e., the coupling and heterogeneity of the UAV/USV's trajectories. Then, we formulate a total energy consumption minimization problem to jointly optimize the trajectories, flying and hovering times, target scheduling, and beamformers under the constraints of water currents, collision avoidance, and Sensing and Communication (S\&C) requirements. To address the strong coupling of the variables, we divide the original problem into two subproblems, namely, the hover point selection and the joint trajectory planning and beamforming design. In the first subproblem, we propose a three-step hierarchical method including: (1) a virtual base station coverage (VBSC) and clustering algorithm to obtain the target scheduling and rough position of hover points; (2) a Bi-traveling salesman problem with neighborhood (Bi-TSPN)-based algorithm to determine the visiting order sequence of the hover points; (3) a hover point refinement and time allocation algorithm to further optimize the time allocation. In the latter subproblem, we complete the remaining trajectory planning and beamforming design in each flying and hovering stage by developing a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing sequential access and leader-follower strategies.

Title: RL-Aided Cognitive ISAC: Robust Detection and Sensing-Communication Trade-offs
Authors: Adam Umra, Aya M. Ahmed, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Short Blocks, Fast Sensing: Finite Blocklength Tradeoffs in RIS-Assisted ISAC
Authors: Adam Umra, Kevin Weinberger, Aymen Khaleel, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance, achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.

Title: Eye Movement Analysis in Simulated Driving Scenarios
Authors: Smilja Stokanović, Jaka Sodnik, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: This study investigates eye movement behaviour during three conditions: Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated drive under reduced visibility). Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31 parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the analysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between Baseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or Fog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of 13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index (GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the BCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye movement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other parameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of saccades: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and standard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring the influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these findings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability, while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying visibility conditions.

Title: Policy Gradient Methods for Information-Theoretic Opacity in Markov Decision Processes
Authors: Chongyang Shi, Sumukha Udupa, Michael R. Dorothy, Shuo Han, Jie Fu
Abstract: Opacity, or non-interference, is a property ensuring that an external observer cannot infer confidential information (the "secret") from system observations. We introduce an information-theoretic measure of opacity, which quantifies information leakage using the conditional entropy of the secret given the observer's partial observations in a system modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our objective is to find a control policy that maximizes opacity while satisfying task performance constraints, assuming that an informed observer is aware of the control policy and system dynamics. Specifically, we consider a class of opacity called state-based opacity, where the secret is a propositional formula about the past or current state of the system, and a special case of state-based opacity called language-based opacity, where the secret is defined by a temporal logic formula (LTL) or a regular language recognized by a finite-state automaton. First, we prove that finite-memory policies can outperform Markov policies in optimizing information-theoretic opacity. Second, we develop an algorithm to compute a maximally opaque Markov policy using a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm, and prove its convergence. Since opacity cannot be expressed as a cumulative cost, we develop a novel method to compute the gradient of conditional entropy with respect to policy parameters using observable operators in hidden Markov models. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and optimality of our proposed methods.

Title: An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation
Authors: Marios Impraimakis, Andrew W. Smyth
Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input. Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters, and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

Title: A Non-Uniform Quantization Framework for Time-Encoding Machines
Authors: Kaluguri Yashaswini, Anshu Arora, Satish Mulleti
Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution. Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.

Title: Diffusion Models are Robust Pretrainers
Authors: Mika Yagoda, Shady Abu-Hussein, Raja Giryes
Abstract: Diffusion models have gained significant attention for high-fidelity image generation. Our work investigates the potential of exploiting diffusion models for adversarial robustness in image classification and object detection. Adversarial attacks challenge standard models in these tasks by perturbing inputs to force incorrect predictions. To address this issue, many approaches use training schemes for forcing the robustness of the models, which increase training costs. In this work, we study models built on top of off-the-shelf diffusion models and demonstrate their practical significance: they provide a low-cost path to robust representations, allowing lightweight heads to be trained on frozen features without full adversarial training. Our empirical evaluations on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and PASCAL VOC show that diffusion-based classifiers and detectors achieve meaningful adversarial robustness with minimal compute. While clean and adversarial accuracies remain below state-of-the-art adversarially trained CNNs or ViTs, diffusion pretraining offers a favorable tradeoff between efficiency and robustness. This work opens a promising avenue for integrating diffusion models into resource-constrained robust deployments.

Title: Condition-Invariant fMRI Decoding of Speech Intelligibility with Deep State Space Model
Authors: Ching-Chih Sung, Shuntaro Suzuki, Francis Pingfan Chien, Komei Sugiura, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.

Title: A Calibration Method for Indirect Time-of-Flight Cameras to Eliminate Internal Scattering Interference
Authors: Yansong Du, Jingtong Yao, Yuting Zhou, Feiyu Jiao, Zhaoxiang Jiang, Xun Guan
Abstract: In-camera light scattering is a typical form of non-systematic interference in indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) cameras, primarily caused by multiple reflections and optical path variations within the camera body. This effect can significantly reduce the accuracy of background depth measurements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a calibration-based model derived from real measurement data, introducing three physically interpretable calibration parameters: a normal-exposure amplitude influence coefficient, an overexposure amplitude influence coefficient, and a scattering phase shift coefficient. These parameters are used to describe the effects of foreground size, exposure conditions, and optical path differences on scattering interference. Experimental results show that the depth values calculated using the calibrated parameters can effectively compensate for scattering-induced errors, significantly improving background depth recovery in scenarios with complex foreground geometries and varying illumination conditions. This approach provides a practical, low-cost solution for iToF systems, requiring no complex hardware modifications, and can substantially enhance measurement accuracy and robustness across a wide range of real-world applications.

Title: Nonlinear Instabilities in Computer Network Dynamics
Authors: Priya Ranjan
Abstract: This work studies two types of computer networking models. The primary focus is to understand the different dynamical phenomena observed in practice due to the presence of severe nonlinearities, delays and widely varying operating conditions. The first models considered are of senders running TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and traffic passing through RED (Random Early Detection) gateways. Building on earlier work, a first order nonlinear discrete-time model is developed for the interaction scenario between transport protocols like TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and Active Queuing Management schemes like RED. It is shown that the dynamics resulting from the interaction with TCP is consistent with various dynamical behaviors and parameter sensitivities observed in practice. Using bifurcation-theoretic ideas it is shown that TCP-RED type networks may lose their stability through a period doubling bifurcation followed by border collision bifurcations. The nonlinear dependence of the throughput function of TCP-type flows on drop probability is found to be responsible for the period doubling bifurcation, whereas limited buffer space and lack of sufficient damping results in border collision bifurcations. A second class of models studied in this work deals with optimal rate control in networks and are based on the rate-control framework proposed by Kelly. Using the results on delay-differential equation stability, the stability and its lack thereof is studied through an underlying map which arises naturally in time delay systems. An invariance property of this map is used to prove delay-independent stability and to compute bounds on periodic oscillations.

Title: Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound
Authors: Edoardo Conti, Riccardo Rosati, Lorenzo Federici, Adriano Mancini, Maria Chiara Fiorentin
Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar (TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical challenge for reliable biometric assessment. Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols, including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization from natural-image DINOv3 weights. Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate planes such as TV. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Title: Interpretable Heart Disease Prediction via a Weighted Ensemble Model: A Large-Scale Study with SHAP and Surrogate Decision Trees
Authors: Md Abrar Hasnat, Md Jobayer, Md. Mehedi Hasan Shawon, Md. Golam Rabiul Alam
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern, demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of 80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Title: Reliability Assessment Framework Based on Feature Separability for Pathological Cell Image Classification under Prior Bias
Authors: Takaaki Tachibana, Toru Nagasaka, Yukari Adachi, Hiroki Kagiyama, Ryota Ito, Mitsugu Fujita, Kimihiro Yamashita, Yoshihiro Kakeji
Abstract: \textbf{Background and objective:} Prior probability shift between training and deployment datasets challenges deep learning--based medical image classification. Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. \textbf{Methods:} We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185{,}432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1--20$\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity--based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. \textbf{Results:} Feature separability dominated performance ($\beta = 1.650$, $p < 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($\beta = 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $>0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $<0.3$ consistently required adjustment. \textbf{Conclusion:} Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.

Title: ABIDES-MARL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Environment for Endogenous Price Formation and Execution in a Limit Order Book
Authors: Patrick Cheridito, Jean-Loup Dupret, Zhexin Wu
Abstract: We present ABIDES-MARL, a framework that combines a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology with a new realistic limit-order-book (LOB) simulation system to study equilibrium behavior in complex financial market games. The system extends ABIDES-Gym by decoupling state collection from kernel interruption, enabling synchronized learning and decision-making for multiple adaptive agents while maintaining compatibility with standard RL libraries. It preserves key market features such as price-time priority and discrete tick sizes. Methodologically, we use MARL to approximate equilibrium-like behavior in multi-period trading games with a finite number of heterogeneous agents-an informed trader, a liquidity trader, noise traders, and competing market makers-all with individual price impacts. This setting bridges optimal execution and market microstructure by embedding the liquidity trader's optimization problem within a strategic trading environment. We validate the approach by solving an extended Kyle model within the simulation system, recovering the gradual price discovery phenomenon. We then extend the analysis to a liquidity trader's problem where market liquidity arises endogenously and show that, at equilibrium, execution strategies shape market-maker behavior and price dynamics. ABIDES-MARL provides a reproducible foundation for analyzing equilibrium and strategic adaptation in realistic markets and contributes toward building economically interpretable agentic AI systems for finance.

Title: Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming
Authors: Tyler M. Paine, Anastasia Bizyaeva, Michael R. Benjamin
Abstract: Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario, and a competitive game of capture the flag.

Title: Near Optimal Convergence to Coarse Correlated Equilibrium in General-Sum Markov Games
Authors: Asrin Efe Yorulmaz, Tamer Başar
Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper $\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games, and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.

Authors: Minje Kim, Hongjae Nam, Beomsoo Ko, Hyeongjun Park, Hwanjin Kim, Dong-Hyun Jung, Junil Choi
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology for inter-satellite links (ISLs) due to its high data rate, low power consumption, and reduced interference. However, the performance of inter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While pointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness of PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment hardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and misalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation with a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis more practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo simulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite FSO systems in practice.

Title: Estimation of Segmental Longitudinal Strain in Transesophageal Echocardiography by Deep Learning
Authors: Anders Austlid Taskén, Thierry Judge, Erik Andreas Rye Berg, Jinyang Yu, Bjørnar Grenne, Frank Lindseth, Svend Aakhus, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Nicolas Duchateau, Olivier Bernard, Gabriel Kiss
Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning (DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions. As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset. Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%). Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Title: High-Resolution Magnetic Particle Imaging System Matrix Recovery Using a Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network
Authors: Abuobaida M.Khair, Wenjing Jiang, Yousuf Babiker M. Osman, Wenjun Xia, Xiaopeng Ma
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960), outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo applications.

Title: Downlink Channel Estimation for mmWave Systems with Impulsive Interference
Authors: Kwonyeol Park, Gyoseung Lee, Hyeongtaek Lee, Hwanjin Kim, Junil Choi
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a channel estimation problem in a downlink millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which suffers from impulsive interference caused by hardware non-idealities or external disruptions. Specifically, impulsive interference presents a significant challenge to channel estimation due to its sporadic, unpredictable, and high-power nature. To tackle this issue, we develop a Bayesian channel estimation technique based on variational inference (VI) that leverages the sparsity of the mmWave channel in the angular domain and the intermittent nature of impulsive interference to minimize channel estimation errors. The proposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior inference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms baselines in terms of channel estimation accuracy.

Title: Anomaly Detection-Based UE-Centric Inter-Cell Interference Suppression
Authors: Kwonyeol Park, Hyuckjin Choi, Beomsoo Ko, Minje Kim, Gyoseung Lee, Daecheol Kwon, Hyunjae Park, Byungseung Kim, Min-Ho Shin, Junil Choi
Abstract: The increasing spectral reuse can cause significant performance degradation due to interference from neighboring cells. In such scenarios, developing effective interference suppression schemes is necessary to improve overall system performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel user equipment-centric interference suppression scheme, which effectively detects inter-cell interference (ICI) and subsequently applies interference whitening to mitigate ICI. The proposed scheme, named Z-refined deep support vector data description, exploits a one-class classification-based anomaly detection technique. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms various baselines in terms of interference detection performance with limited time or frequency resources for training and is comparable to the performance based on an ideal genie-aided interference suppression scheme. Furthermore, we demonstrate through test equipment experiments using a commercial fifth-generation modem chipset that the proposed scheme shows performance improvements across various 3rd generation partnership project standard channel environments, including tapped delay line-A, -B, and -C models.

Title: A new class of Markov random fields enabling lightweight sampling
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Courbot, Hugo Gangloff, Bruno Colicchio
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of efficient sampling of Markov random fields (MRF). The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs sampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how to circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random fields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we introduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting new class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the new model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of computational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling using at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties close to classical MRFs.

Title: H-Infinity Filter Enhanced CNN-LSTM for Arrhythmia Detection from Heart Sound Recordings
Authors: Rohith Shinoj Kumar, Rushdeep Dinda, Aditya Tyagi, Annappa B., Naveen Kumar M. R
Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization. Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Title: Accounting for Underspecification in Statistical Claims of Model Superiority
Authors: Thomas Sanchez, Pedro M. Gordaliza, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to be false positives. However, these analyses do not take \emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Title: Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning
Authors: Tiziano Balaconi, Aldo Glielmo, Marco Taboga
Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.

Title: Stochastic Redistribution of Indistinguishable Items in Shared Habitation: A Multi-Agent Simulation Framework
Authors: Syed Haseeb Shah
Abstract: This paper presents a discrete-event stochastic model for the redistribution of indistinguishable personal items, exemplified by socks, among multiple cohabitants sharing a communal laundry system. Drawing on concepts from ecological population dynamics, diffusion processes, and stochastic exchange theory, the model captures the probabilistic mechanisms underlying item mixing, recovery, and loss. Each cohabitant is represented as an autonomous agent whose belongings interact through iterative cycles of collective washing, sorting, and partial correction. The system's evolution is characterized by random mixing events, selective recollection, and attrition over time. Implemented using the SimPy discrete-event simulation framework, the model demonstrates that even minimal exchange probabilities can generate emergent asymmetries, quasi-equilibrium distributions, and long-term disorder. The findings illustrate how stochastic processes inherent to shared domestic systems can produce persistent imbalances, offering a quantitative perspective on an everyday social phenomenon.

Title: Feedback dynamics in Politics: The interplay between sentiment and engagement
Authors: Simone Formentin
Abstract: We investigate feedback mechanisms in political communication by testing whether politicians adapt the sentiment of their messages in response to public engagement. Using over 1.5 million tweets from Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Greece during 2021, we identify sentiment dynamics through a simple yet interpretable linear model. The analysis reveals a closed-loop behavior: engagement with positive and negative messages influences the sentiment of subsequent posts. Moreover, the learned coefficients highlight systematic differences across political roles: opposition members are more reactive to negative engagement, whereas government officials respond more to positive signals. These results provide a quantitative, control-oriented view of behavioral adaptation in online politics, showing how feedback principles can explain the self-reinforcing dynamics that emerge in social media discourse.

Title: Adjustable Low-Cost Highly Sensitive Microwave Oscillator Sensor for Liquid Level Detection
Authors: Mojtaba Joodaki, Mehrdad Jafarian
Abstract: This paper explores the implementation of a low-cost high-precision microwave oscillator sensor with an adjustable input resistance to enhance its limit of detection (LoD). To achieve this, we introduce a \textit{Z$_{2}$} branch in the input network, comprising a transmission line, a capacitor (\textit{C$_{B}$}) and a resistor (\textit{R$_{V}$}). The sensor is tested with eight different liquids with different dielectric constants, including water, IV fluid, milk, ethanol, acetone, petrol, olive oil, and Vaseline. By fine-tuning the \textit{Z$_{2}$} branch, a clear relationship is found between $\varepsilon_{r}$ of materials and R$_{V}$.Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding characteristics, including remarkable linearity (nonlinearity < 2.44\%), high accuracy with an average sensitivity of 21 kHz/$\mu$m, and an excellent limit of detection (LoD < 0.05 mm). The sensor also exhibits good stability across a range of liquid temperatures and shows robust and repeatable behavior. Considering the strong absorption of microwave energy in liquids with high dielectric constants, this oscillator sensor is a superior choice over capacitive sensors for such applications. We validate the performance of the oscillator sensor using water as a representative liquid. Additionally, we substantiate the sensor's improvement through both experimental results and theoretical analysis. Its advantages, including affordability, compatibility with CMOS and MEMS technologies, and ease of fabrication, make it an excellent choice for small-scale liquid detection applications.

Title: LLM-Supported Formal Knowledge Representation for Enhancing Control Engineering Content with an Interactive Semantic Layer
Authors: Julius Fiedler (1), Carsten Knoll (2), Klaus Röbenack (1) ((1) Institute of Control Theory at TU Dresden, (2) Chair of Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering at TU Dresden)
Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an ``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for the control engineering domain.

Title: VecComp: Vector Computing via MIMO Digital Over-the-Air Computation
Authors: Saeed Razavikia, José Mairton Barros Da Silva Junior, Carlo Fischione
Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such, VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Title: Optimal Source Coding of Markov Chains for Real-Time Remote Estimation
Authors: Ismail Cosandal, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol determines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability of the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the average transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal source coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission duration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov decision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission duration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark policies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We observe that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy decreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The performance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process.

Title: Machine Learning-assisted Dynamics-Constrained Day-Ahead Energy Scheduling
Authors: Mingjian Tuo, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Abstract: TThe rapid expansion of inverter-based resources, such as wind and solar power plants, will significantly diminish the presence of conventional synchronous generators in fu-ture power grids with rich renewable energy sources. This transition introduces in-creased complexity and reduces dynamic stability in system operation and control, with low inertia being a widely recognized challenge. However, the literature has not thoroughly explored grid dynamic performance associated with energy scheduling so-lutions that traditionally only consider grid steady-state constraints. This paper will bridge the gap by enforcing grid dynamic constraints when conducting optimal energy scheduling; particularly, this paper explores locational post-contingency rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) requirements to accommodate substantial inertia reductions. This paper introduces a machine learning-assisted RoCoF-constrained unit commit-ment (ML-RCUC) model designed to ensure RoCoF stability after the most severe generator outage while maintaining operational efficiency. A graph-informed NN (GINN)-based RoCoF predictor is first trained on a high-fidelity simulation dataset to track the highest locational RoCoF, which is then reformulated as mixed-integer linear programming constraints that are integrated into the unit commitment model. Case studies, by solving the optimization problem ML-RCUC and validating its solutions with time-domain simulations, demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure loca-tional RoCoF stability with minimum conservativeness.

Title: Guided Bayesian Optimization: Data-Efficient Controller Tuning with Digital Twin
Authors: Mahdi Nobar, Jürg Keller, Alisa Rupenyan, Mohammad Khosravi, John Lygeros
Abstract: This article presents the guided Bayesian optimization algorithm as an efficient data-driven method for iteratively tuning closed-loop controller parameters using an event-triggered digital twin of the system based on available closed-loop data. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to identify and progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by data-driven criteria related to the digital twin's uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters.

Title: Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics
Authors: Xiaofei Wang, Xingxu Huang, Stephen J. Price, Chao Li
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.

Title: Waveforms for Computing Over the Air
Authors: Ana Pérez-Neira, Marc Martinez-Gost, Alphan Şahin, Saeed Razavikia, Carlo Fischione, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the signal-superposition characteristic of wireless multiple access channels to perform mathematical computations. Initially introduced to enhance communication reliability in interference channels and wireless sensor networks, AirComp has more recently found applications in task-oriented communications, like wireless distributed learning and in wireless control systems. Its adoption aims to address latency challenges arising from an increased number of edge devices or Internet of Things (IoT) devices accessing the constrained wireless spectrum. This paper is the first one to focus on the physical layer of these systems. We present a unified framework, specifically on the waveform and the signal processing aspects at the transmitter and receiver to meet the challenges that AirComp presents within the different contexts and use cases.

Title: Real World Federated Learning with a Knowledge Distilled Transformer for Cardiac CT Imaging
Authors: Malte Tölle, Philipp Garthe, Clemens Scherer, Jan Moritz Seliger, Andreas Leha, Nina Krüger, Stefan Simm, Simon Martin, Sebastian Eble, Halvar Kelm, Moritz Bednorz, Florian André, Peter Bannas, Gerhard Diller, Norbert Frey, Stefan Groß, Anja Hennemuth, Lars Kaderali, Alexander Meyer, Eike Nagel, Stefan Orwat, Moritz Seiffert, Tim Friede, Tim Seidler, Sandy Engelhardt
Abstract: Federated learning is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often face challenges like partially labeled datasets, where only a few locations have certain expert annotations, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. Leveraging these could enhance transformer architectures ability in regimes with small and diversely annotated sets. We conduct the largest federated cardiac CT analysis to date (n=8,104) in a real-world setting across eight hospitals. Our two-step semi-supervised strategy distills knowledge from task-specific CNNs into a transformer. First, CNNs predict on unlabeled data per label type and then the transformer learns from these predictions with label-specific heads. This improves predictive accuracy and enables simultaneous learning of all partial labels across the federation, and outperforms UNet-based models in generalizability on downstream tasks. Code and model weights are made openly available for leveraging future cardiac CT analysis.

Title: Desynchronization Index: a New Connectivity Approach for Exploring Epileptogenic Networks
Authors: Federico Mason, Lorenzo Ferri, Lidia Di Vito, Lara Alvisi, Luca Zanuttini, Matteo Martinoni, Roberto Mai, Francesco Cardinale, Paolo Tinuper, Roberto Michelucci, Elena Pasini, Francesca Bisulli
Abstract: Objective: This work presents a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the goal of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods and procedures: We consider the Phase Transfer Entropy (PTE) to estimate the effective connectivity between SEEG channels, and design a novel algorithm, named the Desynchronization Index (DI), that identifies the EZ as the group of channels showing independent behavior with respect to the rest of the network during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. Results: We test the proposed DI algorithm against the Epileptogenicity Index (EI) on a clinical dataset of 20 patients, considering the channels that were thermocoagulated at the end of SEEG monitoring as the detection target. Our results indicate that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.85 vs. AUC=0.83), while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). Conclusion: The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy in the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. Clinical impact: The integration of connectivity- and energy-based features can lead to the definition of a new biomarker of epileptogenic channels, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving the understanding of the dynamics behind the generation of seizures.

Title: On the Number of Control Nodes in Boolean Networks with Degree Constraints
Authors: Liangjie Sun, Wai-Ki Ching, Tatsuya Akutsu
Abstract: This paper studies the minimum control node set problem for Boolean networks (BNs) with degree constraints. The main contribution is to derive the nontrivial lower and upper bounds on the size of the minimum control node set through combinatorial analysis of four types of BNs (i.e., $k$-$k$-XOR-BNs, simple $k$-$k$-AND-BNs, $k$-$k$-AND-BNs with negation and $k$-$k$-NC-BNs, where the $k$-$k$-AND-BN with negation is an extension of the simple $k$-$k$-AND-BN that considers the occurrence of negation and NC means nested canalyzing). More specifically, four bounds for the size of the minimum control node set: general lower bound, best case upper bound, worst case lower bound, and general upper bound are studied. By dividing nodes into three disjoint sets, extending the time to reach the target state, and utilizing necessary conditions for controllability, these bounds are obtained, and further meaningful results and phenomena are discovered. Notably, all of the above results involving the AND function also apply to the OR function.

Title: A Block-Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm with Dictionary Parameter Estimation for Multi-Sensor Data Fusion
Authors: Jakob Möderl, Anders Malte Westerkam, Alexander Venus, Erik Leitinger
Abstract: We propose an sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method that leverages group sparsity and multiple parameterized dictionaries to detect the relevant dictionary entries and estimate their continuous parameters by combining data from multiple independent sensors. In a MIMO multi-radar setup, we demonstrate its effectiveness in jointly detecting and localizing multiple objects, while also emphasizing its broader applicability to various signal processing tasks. A key benefit of the proposed SBL-based method is its ability to resolve correlated dictionary entries-such as closely spaced objects-resulting in uncorrelated estimates that improve subsequent estimation stages. Through numerical simulations, we show that our method outperforms the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm when two objects cross paths using a single radar. Furthermore, we illustrate how fusing measurements from multiple independent radars leads to enhanced detection and localization performance.

Title: Chance-Constrained Neural MPC under Uncontrollable Agents via Sequential Convex Programming
Authors: Shuqi Wang, Mingyang Feng, Yu Chen, Yue Gao, Xiang Yin
Abstract: This work investigates the challenge of ensuring safety guarantees under uncontrollable agents whose behaviors are stochastic and depend on both their own and the system's states. We present a neural model predictive control (MPC) framework that predicts the trajectory of the uncontrollable agent using a predictor learned from offline data. To provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction errors, we employ split conformal prediction to construct region-specific, time-dependent uncertainty bounds, which are integrated into the MPC formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex, discontinuous optimization problem, we propose a two-loop iterative sequential convex programming algorithm. The inner loop solves convexified subproblems with fixed error bounds, while the outer loop refines these bounds based on updated control sequences. We establish convergence guarantees under mild regularity conditions and demonstrate the optimality of the algorithm. We illustrate our method with an autonomous driving scenario involving interactive pedestrians. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods, with success rates exceeding 99.5\% while maintaining higher average speeds in multi-pedestrian scenarios.

Title: A moving horizon estimator for aquifer thermal energy storages
Authors: Johannes van Randenborgh, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) represent groundwater saturated aquifers that store thermal energy in the form of heated or cooled groundwater. Combining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat) and winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES throughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC technology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control (MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach for ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial temperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater temperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation of the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the borehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based observers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since the model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of the hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator based on a quadratic program.

Title: NMCSE: Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation Method via Optimal Transport for Cardiovascular Disease Detection
Authors: Peihong Zhang, Zhixin Li, Rui Sang, Yuxuan Liu, Yiqiang Cai, Yizhou Tan, Shengchen Li
Abstract: The coupling signal refers to a latent physiological signal that characterizes the transformation from cardiac electrical excitation, captured by the electrocardiogram (ECG), to mechanical contraction, recorded by the phonocardiogram (PCG). By encoding the temporal and functional interplay between electrophysiological and hemodynamic events, it serves as an intrinsic link between modalities and offers a unified representation of cardiac function, with strong potential to enhance multi-modal cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection. However, existing coupling signal estimation methods remain highly vulnerable to noise, particularly in real-world clinical and physiological settings, which undermines their robustness and limits practical value. In this study, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates coupling signal estimation as a distribution matching problem solved via optimal transport. By jointly aligning amplitude and timing, NMCSE avoids noise amplification and enables stable signal estimation. When integrated into a Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction (TSFE) network, the estimated coupling signal effectively enhances multi-modal fusion for more accurate CVD detection. To evaluate robustness under real-world conditions, we design two complementary experiments targeting distinct sources of noise. The first uses the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with simulated hospital noise to assess the resilience of NMCSE to clinical interference. The second leverages the EPHNOGRAM dataset with motion-induced physiological noise to evaluate intra-state estimation stability across activity levels. Experimental results show that NMCSE consistently outperforms existing methods under both clinical and physiological noise, highlighting it as a noise-robust estimation approach that enables reliable multi-modal cardiac detection in real-world conditions.

Title: Joint Scheduling of DER under Demand Charges: Structure and Approximation
Authors: Ruixiao Yang, Gulai Shen, Ahmed S. Alahmed, Chuchu Fan
Abstract: We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering tariffs with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based structure. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to a theoretical upper bound.

Authors: Chunxi Wang, Maoshen Jia, Wenyu Jin
Abstract: Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) accurately characterize acoustic properties of indoor environments and play a crucial role in applications such as speech enhancement, speech recognition, and audio rendering in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Existing blind estimation methods struggle to achieve practical accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose the dynamic audio-room acoustic synthesis (DARAS) model, a novel deep learning framework that is explicitly designed for blind RIR estimation from monaural reverberant speech signals. First, a dedicated deep audio encoder effectively extracts relevant nonlinear latent space features. Second, the Mamba-based self-supervised blind room parameter estimation (MASS-BRPE) module, utilizing the efficient Mamba state space model (SSM), accurately estimates key room acoustic parameters and features. Third, the system incorporates a hybrid-path cross-attention feature fusion module, enhancing deep integration between audio and room acoustic features. Finally, our proposed dynamic acoustic tuning (DAT) decoder adaptively segments early reflections and late reverberation to improve the realism of synthesized RIRs. Experimental results, including a MUSHRA-based subjective listening study, demonstrate that DARAS substantially outperforms existing baseline models, providing a robust and effective solution for practical blind RIR estimation in real-world acoustic environments.

Title: Joint Lossless Compression and Steganography for Medical Images via Large Language Models
Authors: Pengcheng Zheng, Xiaorong Pu, Kecheng Chen, Jiaxin Huang, Meng Yang, Bai Feng, Yazhou Ren, Jianan Jiang, Chaoning Zhang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promising progress in lossless image compression. However, directly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suffers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based compressors often overlook the security of the compression process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this insight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first devised to partition the entire image into two segments, providing global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we innovatively propose a segmented message steganography algorithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatomical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of compression ratios, efficiency, and security. The source code will be made publicly available.

Title: Phoenix-VAD: Streaming Semantic Endpoint Detection for Full-Duplex Speech Interaction
Authors: Weijie Wu, Wenhao Guan, Kaidi Wang, Peijie Chen, Zhuanling Zha, Junbo Li, Jun Fang, Lin Li, Qingyang Hong
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet they lack a plug-and-play full-duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix-VAD, an LLM-based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix-VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix-VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full-duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next-generation human-computer interaction.

Title: SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion
Authors: Yufei Tong, Guanjie Cheng, Peihan Wu, Yicheng Zhu, Kexu Lu, Feiyi Chen, Meng Xi, Junqin Huang, Xueqiang Yan, Junfan Wang, Shuiguang Deng
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Title: Invited Paper: BitMedViT: Ternary-Quantized Vision Transformer for Medical AI Assistants on the Edge
Authors: Mikolaj Walczak, Uttej Kallakuri, Edward Humes, Xiaomin Lin, Tinoosh Mohsenin
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in interpreting complex medical imaging data. However, their significant computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices used in clinical environments. We introduce, BiTMedViT, a new class of Edge ViTs serving as medical AI assistants that perform structured analysis of medical images directly on the edge. BiTMedViT utilizes ternary- quantized linear layers tailored for medical imaging and com- bines a training procedure with multi-query attention, preserving stability under ternary weights with low-precision activations. Furthermore, BiTMedViT employs task-aware distillation from a high-capacity teacher to recover accuracy lost due to extreme quantization. Lastly, we also present a pipeline that maps the ternarized ViTs to a custom CUDA kernel for efficient memory bandwidth utilization and latency reduction on the Jetson Orin Nano. Finally, BiTMedViT achieves 86% diagnostic accuracy (89% SOTA) on MedMNIST across 12 datasets, while reducing model size by 43x, memory traffic by 39x, and enabling 16.8 ms inference at an energy efficiency up to 41x that of SOTA models at 183.62 GOPs/J on the Orin Nano. Our results demonstrate a practical and scientifically grounded route for extreme-precision medical imaging ViTs deployable on the edge, narrowing the gap between algorithmic advances and deployable clinical tools.

Title: PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering
Authors: John-Joseph Brady, Benjamin Cox, Yunpeng Li, Víctor Elvira
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.

Title: Estimation of aboveground biomass in a tropical dry forest: An intercomparison of airborne, unmanned, and space laser scanning
Authors: Nelson Mattié, Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa, Pablo Crespo-Peremarch, Juan-Ygnacio López-Hernández
Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elevminimum, ElevL3, levMADmode, Elevmode, ElevMADmedian, and Elevskewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha. The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.

Title: Constrained computational hybrid controller for Input Affine Hybrid Dynamical Systems
Authors: Ali Taghavian, Ali Safi, Esmaeel Khanmirza
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are viewed as the most complicated systems with continuous and event-based behaviors. Since traditional controllers cannot handle these systems, some newly-developed controllers have been published in recent decades to deal with them. This paper presents a novel implementable constrained final-state controller based on partitioning the system's state-space, computational simulations, and graph theory. Experimental results and a comparison with Model Predictive Controller on the three tank benchmark and swing-up control of a pendulum show the effectiveness of the proposed Computational Hybrid Controller(CHC).

Title: Stacked Flexible Intelligent Metasurface Design for Multi-User Wireless Communications
Authors: Ahmed Magbool, Vaibhav Kumar, Marco Di Renzo, Mark F. Flanagan
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as an effective solution for next-generation wireless networks. A SIM comprises multiple metasurface layers that enable signal processing directly in the wave domain. Moreover, recent advances in flexible metamaterials have highlighted the potential of flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs), which can be physically morphed to enhance communication performance. In this paper, we propose a stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM)-based communication system for the first time, where each metasurface layer is deformable to improve the system's performance. We first present the system model, including the transmit and receive signal models as well as the channel model, and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system sum rate under constraints on the transmit power budget, morphing distance, and the unit-modulus condition of the meta-atom responses. To solve this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SFIM-based system achieves significant performance gains compared to its rigid SIM counterpart.

Title: Deep Generative Models for Enhanced Vitreous OCT Imaging
Authors: Simone Sarrocco, Philippe C. Cattin, Peter M. Maloca, Paul Friedrich, Philippe Valmaggia
Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate deep learning (DL) models for enhancing vitreous optical coherence tomography (OCT) image quality and reducing acquisition time. Methods: Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPMs), Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (BBDMs), U-Net, Pix2Pix, and Vector-Quantised Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN) were used to generate high-quality spectral-domain (SD) vitreous OCT images. Inputs were SD ART10 images, and outputs were compared to pseudoART100 images obtained by averaging ten ART10 images per eye location. Model performance was assessed using image quality metrics and Visual Turing Tests, where ophthalmologists ranked generated images and evaluated anatomical fidelity. The best model's performance was further tested within the manually segmented vitreous on newly acquired data. Results: U-Net achieved the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 30.230) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.820), followed by cDDPM. For Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Pix2Pix (0.697) and cDDPM (0.753) performed best. In the first Visual Turing Test, cDDPM ranked highest (3.07); in the second (best model only), cDDPM achieved a 32.9% fool rate and 85.7% anatomical preservation. On newly acquired data, cDDPM generated vitreous regions more similar in PSNR to the ART100 reference than true ART1 or ART10 B-scans and achieved higher PSNR on whole images when conditioned on ART1 than ART10. Conclusions: Results reveal discrepancies between quantitative metrics and clinical evaluation, highlighting the need for combined assessment. cDDPM showed strong potential for generating clinically meaningful vitreous OCT images while reducing acquisition time fourfold. Translational Relevance: cDDPMs show promise for clinical integration, supporting faster, higher-quality vitreous imaging. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.

Title: MM-2FSK: Multimodal Frequency Shift Keying for Ultra-Efficient and Robust High-Resolution MIMO Radar Imaging
Authors: Vanessa Wirth, Johanna Bräunig, Martin Vossiek, Tim Weyrich, Marc Stamminger
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of static and rapidly moving targets demands three-dimensional imaging solutions with high temporal and spatial resolution. Radar sensors are a promising sensing modality because of their fast capture rates and their independence from lighting conditions. To achieve high spatial resolution, MIMO radars with large apertures are required. Yet, they are infrequently used for dynamic scenarios due to significant limitations in signal processing algorithms. These limitations impose substantial hardware constraints due to their computational intensity and reliance on large signal bandwidths, ultimately restricting the sensor's capture rate. One solution of previous work is to use few frequencies only, which enables faster capture and requires less computation; however, this requires coarse knowledge of the target's position and works in a limited depth range only. To address these challenges, we extend previous work into the multimodal domain with MM-2FSK, which leverages an assistive optical depth sensing modality to obtain a depth prior, enabling high framerate capture with only few frequencies. We evaluate our method using various target objects with known ground truth geometry that is spatially registered to real millimeter-wave MIMO radar measurements. Our method demonstrates superior performance in terms of depth quality, being able to compete with the time- and resource-intensive measurements with many frequencies.

Title: Expertise and confidence explain how social influence evolves along intellective tasks
Authors: Omid Askarisichani, Elizabeth Y. Huang, Abed K. Musaffar, Noah E. Friedkin, Francesco Bullo, Ambuj K. Singh
Abstract: Discovering the antecedents of individuals' influence in collaborative environments is an important, practical, and challenging problem. In this paper, we study interpersonal influence in small groups of individuals who collectively execute a sequence of intellective tasks. We observe that along an issue sequence with feedback, individuals with higher expertise and social confidence are accorded higher interpersonal influence. We also observe that low-performing individuals tend to underestimate their high-performing teammate's expertise. Based on these observations, we introduce three hypotheses and present empirical and theoretical support for their validity. We report empirical evidence on longstanding theories of transactive memory systems, social comparison, and confidence heuristics on the origins of social influence. We propose a cognitive dynamical model inspired by these theories to describe the process by which individuals adjust interpersonal influences over time. We demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting individuals' influence and provide analytical results on its asymptotic behavior for the case with identically performing individuals. Lastly, we propose a novel approach using deep neural networks on a pre-trained text embedding model for predicting the influence of individuals. Using message contents, message times, and individual correctness collected during tasks, we are able to accurately predict individuals' self-reported influence over time. Extensive experiments verify the accuracy of the proposed models compared to baselines such as structural balance and reflected appraisal model. While the neural networks model is the most accurate, the dynamical model is the most interpretable for influence prediction.

Title: RASPNet: A Benchmark Dataset for Radar Adaptive Signal Processing Applications
Authors: Shyam Venkatasubramanian, Bosung Kang, Ali Pezeshki, Muralidhar Rangaswamy, Vahid Tarokh
Abstract: We present a large-scale dataset called RASPNet for radar adaptive signal processing (RASP) applications to support the development of data-driven models within the adaptive radar community. RASPNet exceeds 16 TB in size and comprises 100 realistic scenarios compiled over a variety of topographies and land types across the contiguous United States. For each scenario, RASPNet comprises 10,000 clutter realizations from an airborne radar setting, which can be used to benchmark radar and complex-valued learning algorithms. RASPNet intends to fill a prominent gap in the availability of a large-scale, realistic dataset that standardizes the evaluation of RASP techniques and complex-valued neural networks. We outline its construction, organization, and several applications, including a transfer learning example to demonstrate how RASPNet can be used for real-world adaptive radar scenarios.

Title: Feature compression is the root cause of adversarial fragility in neural network classifiers
Authors: Jingchao Gao, Ziqing Lu, Raghu Mudumbai, Xiaodong Wu, Jirong Yi, Myung Cho, Catherine Xu, Hui Xie, Weiyu Xu
Abstract: In this paper, we uniquely study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (NN) for classification tasks against that of optimal classifiers. We look at the smallest magnitude of possible additive perturbations that can change a classifier's output. We provide a matrix-theoretic explanation of the adversarial fragility of deep neural networks for classification. In particular, our theoretical results show that a neural network's adversarial robustness can degrade as the input dimension $d$ increases. Analytically, we show that neural networks' adversarial robustness can be only $1/\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible adversarial robustness of optimal classifiers. Our theories match remarkably well with numerical experiments of practically trained NN, including NN for ImageNet images. The matrix-theoretic explanation is consistent with an earlier information-theoretic feature-compression-based explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural networks.

Title: Prevailing Research Areas for Music AI in the Era of Foundation Models
Authors: Megan Wei, Mateusz Modrzejewski, Aswin Sivaraman, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: Parallel to rapid advancements in foundation model research, the past few years have witnessed a surge in music AI applications. As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.

Title: Constrained Optimal Fuel Consumption of HEVs under Observational Noise
Authors: Shuchang Yan, Haoran Sun
Abstract: In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.

Title: Detection Augmented Bandit Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach
Authors: Yu-Han Huang, Argyrios Gerogiannis, Subhonmesh Bose, Venugopal V. Veeravalli
Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being non-stationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such Detection Augmented Bandit (DAB) procedures. To this end, we first provide novel, improved performance lower bounds for PS-MABs. Then, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a DAB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of DAB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that the regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular DAB procedures that are order-optimal. Finally, we showcase the practical effectiveness of our modular DAB approach in our experiments, studying its regret performance compared to other methods and investigating its detection capabilities.

Title: Multi-Objective Planning with Contextual Lexicographic Reward Preferences
Authors: Pulkit Rustagi, Yashwanthi Anand, Sandhya Saisubramanian
Abstract: Autonomous agents are often required to plan under multiple objectives whose preference ordering varies based on context. The agent may encounter multiple contexts during its course of operation, each imposing a distinct lexicographic ordering over the objectives, with potentially different reward functions associated with each context. Existing approaches to multi-objective planning typically consider a single preference ordering over the objectives, across the state space, and do not support planning under multiple objective orderings within an environment. We present Contextual Lexicographic Markov Decision Process (CLMDP), a framework that enables planning under varying lexicographic objective orderings, depending on the context. In a CLMDP, both the objective ordering at a state and the associated reward functions are determined by the context. We employ a Bayesian approach to infer a state-context mapping from expert trajectories. Our algorithm to solve a CLMDP first computes a policy for each objective ordering and then combines them into a single context-aware policy that is valid and cycle-free. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot.

Title: Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment
Authors: Zhihao Zhan, Wang Pang, Xiang Zhu, Yechao Bai
Abstract: In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.

Title: Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets
Authors: Marc Schneider, Renato Loureiro, Torbjørn Cunis, Walter Fichter
Abstract: Trajectory prediction of aerial vehicles is a key requirement in applications ranging from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. While most prediction methods assume deterministic target motion, real-world targets often exhibit stochastic behaviors such as evasive maneuvers or random gliding patterns. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework based on Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to model and predict such stochastic dynamics directly from trajectory data. The learned model generates probability distributions of future target positions conditioned on initial states and dynamic parameters, enabling efficient sampling and exact density evaluation. To provide deterministic surrogates compatible with existing guidance and planning algorithms, sampled trajectories are clustered using a time series k-means approach, yielding a set of representative "virtual target" trajectories. The method is target-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only trajectory data for training, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement for deterministic predictors. Simulated scenarios with maneuvering and ballistic targets demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between deterministic assumptions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.

Title: Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering with Model Predictive Control Enables Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface
Authors: Yimou Wu, Mingyang Liang, Chongfeng Liu, Zhongzhong Cao, Huihuan Qian
Abstract: Recovering a drone on a disturbed water surface remains a significant challenge in maritime robotics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for robot-assisted drone recovery on a wavy surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using KalmanNet Plus Plus (KalmanNet++), a Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering we proposed. Secondly, effective motion planning using the desired position we got for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control (RHMPC). Specifically, we compared multiple prediction methods and proposed KalmanNet Plus Plus to predict the position of the UAV, thereby obtaining the desired position. The KalmanNet++ predicts the drone's future position 0.1\,s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited constraints such as torque constraints and joint constraints. For the system design, we provide a collaborative system, comprising a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem, enables drone lifting and drone recovery. Simulation and real-world experiments using wave-disturbed motion data demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95\% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10\% in efficiency and 20\% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.

Title: The Difference between the Left and Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter
Authors: Yixiao Ge, Giulio Delama, Martin Scheiber, Alessandro Fornasier, Pieter van Goor, Stephan Weiss, Robert Mahony
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right- IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of the two filters.

Title: Action Chunking and Exploratory Data Collection Yield Exponential Improvements in Behavior Cloning for Continuous Control
Authors: Thomas T. Zhang, Daniel Pfrommer, Chaoyi Pan, Nikolai Matni, Max Simchowitz
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.

Title: Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models
Authors: Brennen A. Hill, Mant Koh En Wei, Thangavel Jishnuanandh
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Title: Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Shu Wu, Chenxing Li, Wenfu Wang, Hao Zhang, Hualei Wang, Meng Yu, Dong Yu
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Title: Drift Plus Optimistic Penalty: A Learning Framework for Stochastic Network Optimization with Improved Regret Bounds
Authors: Sathwik Chadaga, Eytan Modiano
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks, where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off, however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its regret is indeed sub-linear.

Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.

Title: Electromagnetic Investigation of Crosstalk in Bent Microstrip Lines with Partial and Apertured Shielding: Simulations and Measurements
Authors: Mohammad Eskandari, Mojtaba Joodaki
Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory, and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different problem cases.

Title: Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers
Authors: Henry Pritchard, Rahul Parhi
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.

Title: Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding
Authors: Jungyeon Koh, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.
