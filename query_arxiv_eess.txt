Title: Joint single-shot ToA and DoA estimation for VAA-based BLE ranging with phase ambiguity: A deep learning-based approach
Authors: Jincheng Xie, Yili Deng, Jiguang He, Pengyu Wang, Miaomiao Dong, Rui Tang, Zhongyi Huang
Abstract: Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.

Title: Super-résolution non supervisée d'images hyperspectrales de télédétection utilisant un entraînement entièrement synthétique
Authors: Xinxin Xu, Yann Gousseau, Christophe Kervazo, Saïd Ladjal
Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving the rich spectral information of hyperspectral images. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with high-resolution ground truth data, which is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on synthetic abundance data. The hyperspectral image is first decomposed into endmembers and abundance maps through hyperspectral unmixing. A neural network is then trained to super-resolve these maps using data generated with the dead leaves model, which replicates the statistical properties of real abundances. The final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by recombining the super-resolved abundance maps with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the relevance of synthetic data for training.

Title: EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography
Authors: Alif Munim, Adibvafa Fallahpour, Teodora Szasz, Ahmadreza Attarpour, River Jiang, Brana Sooriyakanthan, Maala Sooriyakanthan, Heather Whitney, Jeremy Slivnick, Barry Rubin, Wendy Tsang, Bo Wang
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography promise to reduce annotation burden and improve diagnostic consistency by learning generalizable representations from large unlabeled video archives. However, current approaches fail to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts that dominate ultrasound imagery. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model for echocardiography trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. We also introduce a novel multi-view probing framework with factorized stream embeddings that standardizes evaluation under frozen backbones. Compared to prior methods, EchoJEPA reduces left ventricular ejection fraction estimation error by 19% and achieves 87.4% view classification accuracy. EchoJEPA exhibits strong sample efficiency, reaching 78.6% accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42.1% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Under acoustic perturbations, EchoJEPA degrades by only 2.3% compared to 16.8% for the next best model, and transfers zero-shot to pediatric patients with 15% lower error than the next best model, outperforming all fine-tuned baselines. These results establish latent prediction as a superior paradigm for ultrasound foundation models.

Title: Pilots and Other Predictable Elements of the Starlink Ku-Band Downlink
Authors: Wenkai Qin, Mark L. Psiaki, John R. Bowman, Todd E. Humphreys
Abstract: We identify and characterize dedicated pilot symbols and other predictable elements embedded within the Starlink Ku-band downlink waveform. Exploitation of these predictable elements enables precise opportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing using compact, low-gain receivers by maximizing the signal processing gain available for signal acquisition and time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation. We develop an acquisition and demodulation framework to decode Starlink frames and disclose the explicit sequences of the edge pilots -- bands of 4QAM symbols located at both edges of each Starlink channel that apparently repeat identically across all frames, beams, channels, and satellites. We further reveal that the great majority of QPSK-modulated symbols do not carry high-entropy user data but instead follow a regular tessellated structure superimposed on a constant reference template. We demonstrate that exploiting frame-level predictable elements yields a processing gain of approximately 48 dB, thereby enabling low-cost, compact receivers to extract precise TOA measurements even from low-SNR Starlink side beams.

Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at this https URL under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.

Title: Physics-based generation of multilayer corneal OCT data via Gaussian modeling and MCML for AI-driven diagnostic and surgical guidance applications
Authors: Jinglun Yu, Yaning Wang, Rosalinda Xiong, Ziyi Huang, Kristina Irsch, Jin U. Kang
Abstract: Training deep learning models for corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is limited by the availability of large, well-annotated datasets. We present a configurable Monte Carlo simulation framework that generates synthetic corneal B-scan optical OCT images with pixel-level five-layer segmentation labels derived directly from the simulation geometry. A five-layer corneal model with Gaussian surfaces captures curvature and thickness variability in healthy and keratoconic eyes. Each layer is assigned optical properties from the literature and light transport is simulated using Monte Carlo modeling of light transport in multi-layered tissues (MCML), while incorporating system features such as the confocal PSF and sensitivity roll-off. This approach produces over 10,000 high-resolution (1024x1024) image-label pairs and supports customization of geometry, photon count, noise, and system parameters. The resulting dataset enables systematic training, validation, and benchmarking of AI models under controlled, ground-truth conditions, providing a reproducible and scalable resource to support the development of diagnostic and surgical guidance applications in image-guided ophthalmology.

Title: Wide-field high-resolution microscopy via high-speed galvo scanning and real-time mosaicking
Authors: Ziyi Huang, Rosalinda Xiong, Yaning Wang, Jinglun Yu, Jin U. Kang
Abstract: Wide-field high-resolution microscopy requires fast scanning and accurate image mosaicking to cover large fields of view without compromising image quality. However, conventional galvanometric scanning, particularly under sinusoidal driving, can introduce nonuniform spatial sampling, leading to geometric inconsistencies and brightness variations across the scanned field. To address these challenges, we present an image mosaicking framework for wide-field microscopic imaging that is applicable to both linear and sinusoidal galvanometric scanning strategies. The proposed approach combines a translation-based geometric mosaicking model with region-of-interest (ROI) based brightness correction and seam-aware feathering to improve radiometric consistency across large fields of view. The method relies on calibrated scan parameters and synchronized scan--camera control, without requiring image-content-based registration. Using the proposed framework, wide-field mosaicked images were successfully reconstructed under both linear and sinusoidal scanning strategies, achieving a field of view of up to $2.5 \times 2.5~\mathrm{cm}^2$ with a total acquisition time of approximately $6~\mathrm{s}$ per dataset. Quantitative evaluation shows that both scanning strategies demonstrate improved image quality, including enhanced brightness uniformity, increased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and reduced seam-related artifacts after image processing, while preserving a lateral resolution of $7.81~\mu\mathrm{m}$. Overall, the presented framework provides a practical and efficient solution for scan-based wide-field microscopic mosaicking.

Title: Super-Resolution and Denoising of Corneal B-Scan OCT Imaging Using Diffusion Model Plug-and-Play Priors
Authors: Yaning Wang, Jinglun Yu, Wenhan Guo, Ziyi Huang, Rosalinda Xiong, Yu Sun, Jin U. Kang
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is pivotal in corneal imaging for both surgical planning and diagnosis. However, high-speed acquisitions often degrade spatial resolution and increase speckle noise, posing challenges for accurate interpretation. We propose an advanced super-resolution framework leveraging diffusion model plug-and-play (PnP) priors to achieve 4x spatial resolution enhancement alongside effective denoising of OCT Bscan images. Our approach formulates reconstruction as a principled Bayesian inverse problem, combining Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling with pretrained generative priors to enforce anatomical consistency. We comprehensively validate the framework using \emph{in vivo} fisheye corneal datasets, to assess robustness and scalability under diverse clinical settings. Comparative experiments against bicubic interpolation, conventional supervised U-Net baselines, and alternative diffusion priors demonstrate that our method consistently yields more precise anatomical structures, improved delineation of corneal layers, and superior noise suppression. Quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and perceptual metrics. This work highlights the potential of diffusion-driven plug-and-play reconstruction to deliver high-fidelity, high-resolution OCT imaging, supporting more reliable clinical assessments and enabling advanced image-guided interventions. Our findings suggest the approach can be extended to other biomedical imaging modalities requiring robust super-resolution and denoising.

Title: Real-time topology-aware M-mode OCT segmentation for robotic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) guidance
Authors: Rosalinda Xiong, Jinglun Yu, Yaning Wang, Ziyi Huang, Jin U. Kang
Abstract: Robotic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) requires accurate real time depth feedback to approach Descemet's membrane (DM) without perforation. M-mode intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high temporal resolution depth traces, but speckle noise, attenuation, and instrument induced shadowing often result in discontinuous or ambiguous layer interfaces that challenge anatomically consistent segmentation at deployment frame rates. We present a lightweight, topology aware M-mode segmentation pipeline based on UNeXt that incorporates anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed system achieves end to end throughput exceeding 80 Hz measured over the complete preprocessing inference overlay pipeline on a single GPU, demonstrating practical real time guidance beyond model only timing. This operating margin provides temporal headroom to reject low quality or dropout frames while maintaining a stable effective depth update rate. Evaluation on a standard rabbit eye M-mode dataset using an established baseline protocol shows improved qualitative boundary stability compared with topology agnostic controls, while preserving deployable real time performance.

Title: Estimation of Cell-to-Cell Variation and State of Health for Battery Modules with Parallel-Connected Cells
Authors: Qinan Zhou, Jing Sun
Abstract: Estimating cell-to-cell variation (CtCV) and state of health (SoH) for battery modules with parallel-connected cells is challenging when only module-level signals are measurable and individual cell behaviors remain unobserved. Although progress has been made in SoH estimation, CtCV estimation remains unresolved in the literature. This paper proposes a unified framework that accurately estimates both CtCV and SoH for modules using only module-level information extracted from incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA). With the proposed framework, CtCV and SoH estimations can be decoupled into two separate tasks, allowing each to be solved with dedicated algorithms without mutual interference and providing greater design flexibility. The framework also exhibits strong versatility in accommodating different CtCV metrics, highlighting its general-purpose nature. Experimental validation on modules with three parallel-connected cells demonstrates that the proposed framework can systematically select optimal module-level features for CtCV and SoH estimations, deliver accurate CtCV and SoH estimates with high confidence and low computational complexity, remain effective across different C-rates, and be suitable for onboard implementation.

Title: STAR-RIS-Assisted Full-Space Angle Estimation via Finite Rate of Innovation
Authors: Ziming Liu, Tao Chen, Muran Guo, Francesco Verde
Abstract: Conventional sensor architectures typically restrict angle estimation to the half-space. By enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can support full-space angle detection. This paper develops a fullspace angle estimation framework by leveraging a finite rate of innovation (FRI) model enabled by STAR-RIS. We distinguish two practical STAR-RIS configurations: (i) an element-wise uniform setting, where all metasurface elements share identical energy-splitting (ES) coefficients and phase differences, and (ii) a nonuniform ES setting, where the phase difference is common across elements while the ES coefficients vary element-wise to increase design flexibility. For each regime, we formulate the corresponding FRI-based signal model and derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) for angle estimation. To recover the underlying FRI sampling structure, we develop a proximal-gradient algorithm implemented via alternating projections in matrix space and establish its convergence. Exploiting the recovered FRI structure, we construct an annihilating filter whose zeros encode user angles, enabling gridless estimation via polynomial root finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods operate reliably across both configuration regimes and achieve improved angle estimation performance with low overhead.

Title: Hybrid-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems: Dictionary-based Sparse Signal Recovery
Authors: David William Marques Guerra, Taufik Abrao
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are a key technology for future wireless networks, but the large array aperture naturally creates a hybrid-field (HF) propagation regime in which far-field (FF) planar-wave and near-field (NF) spherical-wave components coexist. This work considers the problem of HF channel estimation (CE) and introduces a unified model that superimposes FF and NF contributions according to the Rayleigh distance boundary. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the channel in the angular and polar domains, we formulate the estimation task as a sparse recovery problem. Unlike conventional approaches that require prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, the proposed method operates without requiring knowledge of the sparsity level L and the NF/FF ratio {\gamma}, which are used only for synthetic channel generation in simulations. The channel estimator determines the number of paths adaptively through a residual-based stopping rule. A combined FF/NF dictionary is employed to initialize the support, and each selected atom undergoes continuous parameter refinement to mitigate grid mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves accurate HF channel reconstruction under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for XL-MIMO systems.

Title: WST-X Series: Wavelet Scattering Transform for Interpretable Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Xi Xuan, Davide Carbone, Ruchi Pandey, Wenxin Zhang, Tomi H. Kinnunen
Abstract: Designing front-ends for speech deepfake detectors primarily focuses on two categories. Hand-crafted filterbank features are transparent but are limited in capturing high-level semantic details, often resulting in performance gaps compared to self-supervised (SSL) features. SSL features, in turn, lack interpretability and may overlook fine-grained spectral anomalies. We propose the WST-X series, a novel family of feature extractors that combines the best of both worlds via the wavelet scattering transform (WST), integrating wavelets with nonlinearities analogous to deep convolutional networks. We investigate 1D and 2D WSTs to extract acoustic details and higher-order structural anomalies, respectively. Experimental results on the recent and challenging Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset indicate that WST-X outperforms existing front-ends by a wide margin. Our analysis reveals that a small averaging scale ($J$), combined with high-frequency and directional resolutions ($Q, L$), is critical for capturing subtle artifacts. This underscores the value of translation-invariant and deformation-stable features for robust and interpretable speech deepfake detection.

Title: Tri-Hybrid Holographic Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Shupei Zhang, Shuhao Zeng, Boya Di, Lingyang Song
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can perform both communication and sensing tasks using the same frequency band and hardware, making it a key technology for 6G. As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs.

Title: Fast Diffusion with Physics-Correction for ACOPF
Authors: Shashank Shekhar, Abhinav Karn, Kris Keshav, Shivam Bansal, Parikshit Pareek
Abstract: Generating large-scale, physically consistent AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) datasets is essential for modern data-driven power system applications. The central challenge lies in balancing solution accuracy with computational efficiency. Recent diffusion-based generative models produce high-quality samples; however, their slow sampling procedures limit practical scalability. In this work, we argue that exact physical feasibility is ultimately enforced by power flow solvers or projection steps, and therefore the generative model only needs to produce good initializations rather than perfectly feasible solutions. Based on this insight, we propose a fast diffusion framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) combined with physics-guided corrections during sampling. The proposed method replaces slow stochastic refinement with a small number of deterministic steps and explicit constraint guidance. Experiments on IEEE 6-, 24-, and 118-bus systems show that our approach achieves up to 20 times faster sampling than standard diffusion models while maintaining comparable statistical accuracy and physical consistency. This makes the method well suited for scalable OPF dataset generation and practical power system learning tasks. We release the implementation code at this https URL.

Title: Stationarity and Spectral Characterization of Random Signals on Simplicial Complexes
Authors: Madeline Navarro, Andrei Buciulea, Santiago Segarra, Antonio Marques
Abstract: It is increasingly common for data to possess intricate structure, necessitating new models and analytical tools. Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations.

Title: ProOPF: Benchmarking and Improving LLMs for Professional-Grade Power Systems Optimization Modeling
Authors: Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Xu Wan, Zhenghao Yang, Yifan Zhang, Wengi Huang, Jie Song, Zongyan Zhang, Mingyang Sun
Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.

Title: Mići Princ -- A Little Boy Teaching Speech Technologies the Chakavian Dialect
Authors: Nikola Ljubešić, Peter Rupnik, Tea Perinčić
Abstract: This paper documents our efforts in releasing the printed and audio book of the translation of the famous novel The Little Prince into the Chakavian dialect, as a computer-readable, AI-ready dataset, with the textual and the audio components of the two releases now aligned on the level of each written and spoken word. Our motivation for working on this release is multiple. The first one is our wish to preserve the highly valuable and specific content beyond the small editions of the printed and the audio book. With the dataset published in the this http URL repository, this content is from now on at the fingertips of any interested individual. The second motivation is to make the data available for various artificial-intelligence-related usage scenarios, such as the one we follow upon inside this paper already -- adapting the Whisper-large-v3 open automatic speech recognition model, with decent performance on standard Croatian, to Chakavian dialectal speech. We can happily report that with adapting the model, the word error rate on the selected test data has being reduced to a half, while we managed to remove up to two thirds of the error on character level. We envision many more usages of this dataset beyond the set of experiments we have already performed, both on tasks of artificial intelligence research and application, as well as dialectal research. The third motivation for this release is our hope that this, now highly structured dataset, will be transformed into a digital online edition of this work, allowing individuals beyond the research and technology communities to enjoy the beauty of the message of the little boy in the desert, told through the spectacular prism of the Chakavian dialect.

Title: Impact of Physics-Informed Features on Neural Network Complexity for Li-ion Battery Voltage Prediction in Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircrafts
Authors: Eymen Ipek, Assoc. Mario Hirz
Abstract: The electrification of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft demands high-fidelity battery management systems capable of predicting voltage response under aggressive power dynamics. While data-driven models offer high accuracy, they often require complex architectures and extensive training data. Conversely, equivalent circuit models (ECMs), such as the second-order model, offer physical interpretability but struggle with high C-rate non-linearities. This paper investigates the impact of integrating physics-based information into data-driven surrogate models. Specifically, we evaluate whether physics-informed features allow for the simplification of neural network architectures without compromising accuracy. Using the open-source electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) battery dataset, we compare pure data-driven models against physics-informed data models. Results demonstrate that physics-informed models achieve comparable accuracy to complex pure data-driven models while using up to 75% fewer trainable parameters, significantly reducing computational overhead for potential on-board deployment.

Title: Power Reserve Procurement Considering Dependent Random Variables with PCE
Authors: Nicola Ramseyer, Matthieu Jacobs, Mario Paolone
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for the modelling of dependent random variables using generalised polynomial chaos. This allows to write chance-constrained optimization problems with respect to a joint distribution modelling dependencies between different stochastic inputs. Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution. The paper exploits the problem structure and develops suitable transformations to ensure tractability. The proposed method is applied to a probabilistic power reserve procurement problem. The effectiveness of the method to capture dependencies is shown by comparing the approach with a standard approach considering independent random variables.

Title: Dynamics of Implicit Time-Invariant Max-Min-Plus-Scaling Discrete-Event Systems
Authors: Sreeshma Markkassery, Ton van den Boom, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: Max-min-plus-scaling (MMPS) systems generalize max-plus, min-plus and max-min-plus models with more flexibility in modelling discrete-event dynamics. Especially, implicit MMPS models capture a wide range of real world discrete-event applications. This article analyzes the dynamics of an autonomous, time-invariant implicit MMPS system in a discrete-event framework. First, we provide sufficient conditions under which an implicit MMPS system admits at least one solution to its state-space representation. Then, we analyze its global behavior by determining the key parameters; the growth rates and fixed points. For a solvable MMPS system, we assess the local behavior of the system around its set of fixed points via a normalization procedure. Further, we present the notion of stability for the normalized system. A case study of the urban railway network substantiates the theoretical results.

Title: A Unified SVD-Modal Solution for Sparse Sound Field Reconstruction with Hybrid Spherical-Linear Microphone Arrays
Authors: Shunxi Xu, Thushara Abhayapala, Craig T. Jin
Abstract: We propose a data-driven sparse recovery framework for hybrid spherical linear microphone arrays using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the transfer operator. The SVD yields orthogonal microphone and field modes, reducing to spherical harmonics (SH) in the SMA-only case, while incorporating LMAs introduces complementary modes beyond SH. Modal analysis reveals consistent divergence from SH across frequency, confirming the improved spatial selectivity. Experiments in reverberant conditions show reduced energy-map mismatch and angular error across frequency, distance, and source count, outperforming SMA-only and direct concatenation. The results demonstrate that SVD-modal processing provides a principled and unified treatment of hybrid arrays for robust sparse sound-field reconstruction.

Title: When control meets large language models: From words to dynamics
Authors: Komeil Nosrati, Aleksei Tepljakov, Juri Belikov, Eduard Petlenkov
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are transforming engineering and technology through enhanced control capabilities and decision support, they are simultaneously evolving into complex dynamical systems whose behavior must be regulated. This duality highlights a reciprocal connection in which prompts support control system design while control theory helps shape prompts to achieve specific goals efficiently. In this study, we frame this emerging interconnection of LLM and control as a bidirectional continuum, from prompt design to system dynamics. First, we investigate how LLMs can advance the field of control in two distinct capacities: directly, by assisting in the design and synthesis of controllers, and indirectly, by augmenting research workflows. Second, we examine how control concepts help LLMs steer their trajectories away from undesired meanings, improving reachability and alignment via input optimization, parameter editing, and activation-level interventions. Third, we look into deeper integrations by treating LLMs as dynamic systems within a state-space framework, where their internal representations are closely linked to external control loops. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions to understand LLM behavior and develop interpretable and controllable LLMs that are as trustworthy and robust as their electromechanical counterparts, thereby ensuring they continue to support and safeguard society.

Title: Multipath Extended Target Tracking with Labeled Random Finite Sets
Authors: Guanhua Ding, Tao Huang, Qinchen Wu, Jinping Sun, Yanping Wang, Bing Zhu, Guoqiang Mao
Abstract: High-resolution radar sensors are critical for autonomous systems but pose significant challenges to traditional tracking algorithms due to the generation of multiple measurements per object and the presence of multipath effects. Existing solutions often rely on the point target assumption or treat multipath measurements as clutter, whereas current extended target trackers often lack the capability to maintain trajectory continuity in complex multipath environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter. A unified Bayesian framework based on labeled random finite set theory is derived to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and the association between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. This formulation enables simultaneous trajectory estimation for both targets and reflectors without requiring heuristic post-processing. To enhance computational efficiency, a joint prediction and update implementation based on Gibbs sampling is developed. Furthermore, a measurement-driven adaptive birth model is introduced to initialize tracks without prior knowledge of target positions. Experimental results from simulated scenarios and real-world automotive radar data demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior state estimation accuracy and robust trajectory maintenance in dynamic multipath environments.

Title: Real-world energy data of 200 feeders from low-voltage grids with metadata in Germany over two years
Authors: Manuel Treutlein, Pascal Bothe, Marc Schmidt, Roman Hahn, Oliver Neumann, Ralf Mikut, Veit Hagenmeyer
Abstract: The last mile of the distribution grid is crucial for a successful energy transition, as more low-carbon technology like photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and electric vehicle chargers connect to the low-voltage grid. Despite considerable challenges in operation and planning, researchers often lack access to suitable low-voltage grid data. To address this, we present the FeederBW dataset with data recorded by the German distribution system operator Netze BW. It offers real-world energy data from 200 low-voltage feeders over two years (2023-2025) with weather information and detailed metadata, including changes in low-carbon technology installations. The dataset includes feeder-specific details such as the number of housing units, installed power of low-carbon technology, and aggregated industrial energy data. Furthermore, high photovoltaic feed-in and one-minute temporal resolution makes the dataset unique. FeederBW supports various applications, including machine learning for load forecasting, conducting non-intrusive load monitoring, generating synthetic data, and analyzing the interplay between weather, feeder measurements, and metadata. The dataset reveals insightful patterns and clearly reflects the growing impact of low-carbon technology on low-voltage grids.

Title: Channel-Aware Conditional Diffusion Model for Secure MU-MISO Communications
Authors: Tong Hui, Xiao Tang, Yichen Wang, Qinghe Du, Dusit Niyato, Zhu Han
Abstract: While information securityis a fundamental requirement for wireless communications, conventional optimization based approaches often struggle with real-time implementation, and deep models, typically discriminative in nature, may lack the ability to cope with unforeseen scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the design of legitimate beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to achieve physical layer security by exploiting the conditional diffusion model. Specifically, we reformulate the security optimization as a conditional generative process, using a diffusion model to learn the inherent distribution of near-optimal joint beamforming and AN strategies. We employ a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to integrate channel state information, as the basis for the generative process. Moreover, we fine-tune the trained model using an objective incorporating the sum secrecy rate such that the security performance is further enhanced. Finally, simulation results validate the learning process convergence and demonstrate that the proposed generative method achieves superior secrecy performance across various scenarios as compared with the baselines.

Title: Low-Complexity Distributed Combining Design for Near-Field Cell-Free XL-MIMO Systems

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity distributed combining scheme design for near-field cell-free extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (CF XL-MIMO) systems. Firstly, we construct the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for CF XL-MIMO systems over centralized and distributed processing schemes. Notably, we derive the centralized minimum mean-square error (CMMSE) and local minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) combining schemes over arbitrary channel estimators. Then, focusing on the CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes, we propose five low-complexity distributed combining schemes based on the matrix approximation methodology or the symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) algorithm. More specifically, we propose two matrix approximation methodology-aided combining schemes: Global Statistics \& Local Instantaneous information-based MMSE (GSLI-MMSE) and Statistics matrix Inversion-based LMMSE (SI-LMMSE). These two schemes are derived by approximating the global instantaneous information in the CMMSE combining and the local instantaneous information in the LMMSE combining with the global and local statistics information by asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, respectively. Moreover, by applying the low-complexity SSOR algorithm to iteratively solve the matrix inversion in the LMMSE combining, we derive three distributed SSOR-based LMMSE combining schemes, distinguished from the applied information and initial values.

Title: Statistics Approximation-Enabled Distributed Beamforming for Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Zhe Wang, Emil Björnson, Jiayi Zhang, Peng Zhang, Vitaly Petrov, Bo Ai
Abstract: We study a distributed beamforming approach for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks, referred to as Global Statistics \& Local Instantaneous information-based minimum mean-square error (GSLI-MMSE). The scenario with multi-antenna access points (APs) is considered over three different channel models: correlated Rician fading with fixed or random line-of-sight (LoS) phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh fading. With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes. Numerical results showcase that the proposed GSLI-MMSE scheme demonstrates performance comparable to the optimal centralized MMSE scheme, under the stable LoS conditions, e.g., with static users having Rician fading with a fixed LoS path.

Title: A Multi-decoder Neural Tracking Method for Accurately Predicting Speech Intelligibility
Authors: Rien Sonck, Bernd Accou, Tom Francart, Jonas Vanthornhout
Abstract: Objective: EEG-based methods can predict speech intelligibility, but their accuracy and robustness lag behind behavioral tests, which typically show test-retest differences under 1 dB. We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes of story, 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without losing accuracy.

Title: A Comparison of Set-Based Observers for Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Nico Holzinger, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: Set-based state estimation computes sets of states consistent with a system model given bounded sets of disturbances and noise. Bounding the set of states is crucial for safety-critical applications so that one can ensure that all specifications are met. While numerous approaches have been proposed for nonlinear discrete-time systems, a unified evaluation under comparable conditions is lacking. This paper reviews and implements a representative selection of set-based observers within the CORA framework. To provide an objective comparison, the methods are evaluated on common benchmarks, and we examine computational effort, scalability, and the conservatism of the resulting state bounds. This study highlights characteristic trade-offs between observer categories and set representations, as well as practical considerations arising in their implementation. All implementations are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future development. This paper thereby offers the first broad, tool-supported comparison of guaranteed state estimators for nonlinear discrete-time systems.

Title: Input-to-State Safe Backstepping: Robust Safety-Critical Control with Unmatched Uncertainties
Authors: Max H. Cohen, Pio Ong, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

Title: VR-VFL: Joint Rate and Client Selection for Vehicular Federated Learning Under Imperfect CSI
Authors: Metehan Karatas, Subhrakanti Dey, Christian Rohner, Jose Mairton Barros da Silva Jr
Abstract: Federated learning in vehicular edge networks faces major challenges in efficient resource allocation, largely due to high vehicle mobility and the presence of imperfect channel state information. Many existing methods oversimplify these realities, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal channel conditions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks. Simulation results show that the proposed VR-VFL scheme achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other methods in the literature.

Title: A Narrowband Fully-Analog Multi-Antenna Transmitter
Authors: Nikola Zlatanov
Abstract: This paper proposes a narrowband fully-analog $N$-antenna transmitter that emulates the functionality of a narrowband fully-digital $N$-antenna transmitter. Specifically, in symbol interval $m$, the proposed fully-analog transmitter synthesizes an arbitrary complex excitation vector $\bm x[m]\in\mathbb{C}^N$ with prescribed total power $\|\bm x[m]\|_2^2=P$ from a single coherent RF tone, using only tunable phase-control elements embedded in a passive interferometric programmable network. The programmable network is excited through one input port while the remaining $N - 1$ input ports are impedance matched. In the ideal lossless case, the network transfer is unitary and therefore redistributes RF power among antenna ports without dissipative amplitude control. The synthesis task is posed as a unitary state-preparation problem: program a unitary family so that $\bm V(\bm\varphi)\bm e_1=\bm c$, where $\bm c=\bm x/\sqrt{P}$ and $\|\bm c\|_2=1$. We provide a constructive realization and a closed-form programming rule: a binary magnitude-splitting tree allocates the desired per-antenna magnitudes $|c_n|$ using $N -1$ tunable split ratios, and a per-antenna output phase bank assigns the target phases using $N$ tunable phase shifts. The resulting architecture uses $2N-1$ real tunable degrees of freedom and admits a deterministic $O(N)$ programming procedure with no iterative optimization, enabling symbol-by-symbol updates when the chosen phase-control technology supports the required tuning speed. Using representative COTS components, we model the RF-front-end DC power of the proposed fully-analog transmitter and compare it against an equivalent COTS fully-digital array. For $N\le 16$, the comparison indicates significant RF-front-end power savings for the fully-analog architecture. The results in this paper are intended as a proof-of-concept for a narrowband fully-analog transmitter.

Title: Mitigating Timing-Based Attacks in Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Arkaprava Sain, Sunandan Adhikary, Soumyajit Dey
Abstract: Real-time cyber-physical systems depend on deterministic task execution to guarantee safety and correctness. Unfortunately, this determinism can unintentionally expose timing information that enables adversaries to infer task execution patterns and carry out timing-based attacks targeting safety-critical control tasks. While prior defenses aim to obscure schedules through randomization or isolation, they typically neglect the implications of such modifications on closed-loop control behavior and real-time feasibility. This work studies the problem of securing real-time control workloads against timing inference attacks while explicitly accounting for both schedulability constraints and control performance requirements. We present a scheduling-based mitigation approach that introduces bounded timing perturbations to control task executions in a structured manner, reducing adversarial opportunities without violating real-time guarantees. The framework jointly considers worst-case execution behavior and the impact of execution delays on control performance, enabling the system to operate within predefined safety and performance limits. Through experimental evaluation on representative task sets and control scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrates that exposure to timing-based attacks can be significantly reduced while preserving predictable execution and acceptable control quality.

Title: Conditional Flow Matching for Visually-Guided Acoustic Highlighting
Authors: Hugo Malard, Gael Le Lan, Daniel Wong, David Lou Alon, Yi-Chiao Wu, Sanjeel Parekh
Abstract: Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.

Title: Digital-Twin Empowered Deep Reinforcement Learning For Site-Specific Radio Resource Management in NextG Wireless Aerial Corridor
Authors: Pulok Tarafder, Zoheb Hassan, Imtiaz Ahmed, Danda B. Rawat, Kamrul Hasan, Cong Pu
Abstract: Joint base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors constitutes a challenging radio resource management (RRM) problem. It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks.

Title: Precoding-Oriented CSI Feedback Design with Mutual Information Regularized VQ-VAE
Authors: Xi Chen, Homa Esfahanizadeh, Foad Sohrabi
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.

Title: Scaled Dot-Product Attention implements projection of inputs onto a common surface
Authors: Terence D Sanger
Abstract: Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) is a fundamental component responsible for the success of large-language models and other nonlinear signal processing applications. The rationale for SDPA has been based upon "query, key, value" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of "self-attention", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.

Title: Auto-Augmentation Contrastive Learning for Wearable-based Human Activity Recognition
Authors: Qingyu Wu, Jianfei Shen, Feiyi Fan, Yang Gu, Chenyang Xu, Yiqiang Chen
Abstract: For low-semantic sensor signals from human activity recognition (HAR), contrastive learning (CL) is essential to implement novel applications or generic models without manual annotation, which is a high-performance self-supervised learning (SSL) method. However, CL relies heavily on data augmentation for pairwise comparisons. Especially for low semantic data in the HAR area, conducting good performance augmentation strategies in pretext tasks still rely on manual attempts lacking generalizability and flexibility. To reduce the augmentation burden, we propose an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning (AutoCL) method for wearable-based HAR. AutoCL is based on a Siamese network architecture that shares the parameters of the backbone and with a generator embedded to learn auto-augmentation. AutoCL trains the generator based on the representation in the latent space to overcome the disturbances caused by noise and redundant information in raw sensor data. The architecture empirical study indicates the effectiveness of this design. Furthermore, we propose a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy in AutoCL to enhance encoder representation learning. Extensive experiments based on four wide-used HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed AutoCL method significantly improves recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.

Title: IceBench-S2S: A Benchmark of Deep Learning for Challenging Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Daily Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting in Deep Latent Space
Authors: Jingyi Xu, Shengnan Wang, Weidong Yang, Siwei Tu, Lei Bai, Ben Fei
Abstract: Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate system, significantly influencing polar ecological stability and human activities in coastal regions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks.

Title: Learnable Koopman-Enhanced Transformer-Based Time Series Forecasting with Spectral Control
Authors: Ali Forootani, Raffaele Iervolino
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified family of learnable Koopman operator parameterizations that integrate linear dynamical systems theory with modern deep learning forecasting architectures. We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.

Title: Learning Consistent Causal Abstraction Networks
Authors: Gabriele D'Acunto, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Sergio Barbarossa
Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves and cosheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we tackle the learning of consistent causal abstraction network (CAN), a sheaf-theoretic framework where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs) adhering to the semantic embedding principle, and (iii) edge stalks correspond--up to permutation--to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Title: Perfusion Imaging and Single Material Reconstruction in Polychromatic Photon Counting CT
Authors: Namhoon Kim, Ashwin Pananjady, Amir Pourmorteza, Sara Fridovich-Keil
Abstract: Background: Perfusion computed tomography (CT) images the dynamics of a contrast agent through the body over time, and is one of the highest X-ray dose scans in medical imaging. Recently, a theoretically justified reconstruction algorithm based on a monotone variational inequality (VI) was proposed for single material polychromatic photon-counting CT, and showed promising early results at low-dose imaging. Purpose: We adapt this reconstruction algorithm for perfusion CT, to reconstruct the concentration map of the contrast agent while the static background tissue is assumed known; we call our method VI-PRISM (VI-based PeRfusion Imaging and Single Material reconstruction). We evaluate its potential for dose-reduced perfusion CT, using a digital phantom with water and iodine of varying concentration. Methods: Simulated iodine concentrations range from 0.05 to 2.5 mg/ml. The simulated X-ray source emits photons up to 100 keV, with average intensity ranging from $10^5$ down to $10^2$ photons per detector element. The number of tomographic projections was varied from 984 down to 8 to characterize the tradeoff in photon allocation between views and intensity. Results: We compare VI-PRISM against filtered back-projection (FBP), and find that VI-PRISM recovers iodine concentration with error below 0.4 mg/ml at all source intensity levels tested. Even with a dose reduction between 10x and 100x compared to FBP, VI-PRISM exhibits reconstruction quality on par with FBP. Conclusion: Across all photon budgets and angular sampling densities tested, VI-PRISM achieved consistently lower RMSE, reduced noise, and higher SNR compared to filtered back-projection. Even in extremely photon-limited and sparsely sampled regimes, VI-PRISM recovered iodine concentrations with errors below 0.4 mg/ml, showing that VI-PRISM can support accurate and dose-efficient perfusion imaging in photon-counting CT.

Title: Automated Dysphagia Screening Using Noninvasive Neck Acoustic Sensing
Authors: Jade Chng, Rong Xing, Yunfei Luo, Kristen Linnemeyer-Risser, Tauhidur Rahman, Andrew Yousef, Philip A Weissbrod
Abstract: Pharyngeal health plays a vital role in essential human functions such as breathing, swallowing, and vocalization. Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive acoustic sensing as a practical and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring.

Title: Sub-optimality bounds for certainty equivalent policies in partially observed systems
Authors: Berk Bozkurt, Aditya Mahajan, Ashutosh Nayyar, Yi Ouyang
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the certainty equivalence principle of stochastic control. One interpretation of the classical certainty equivalence principle for linear systems with output feedback and quadratic costs is as follows: the optimal action at each time is obtained by evaluating the optimal state-feedback policy of the stochastic linear system at the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the state. Motivated by this interpretation, we consider certainty equivalent policies for general (non-linear) partially observed stochastic systems that allow for any state estimate rather than restricting to MMSE estimates. In such settings, the certainty equivalent policy is not optimal. For models where the cost and the dynamics are smooth in an appropriate sense, we derive upper bounds on the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies. We present several examples to illustrate the results.

Title: IMAGINE: Intelligent Multi-Agent Godot-based Indoor Networked Exploration
Authors: Tiago Leite, Maria Conceição, António Grilo
Abstract: The exploration of unknown, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments by an autonomous communication-aware and collaborative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges in coordination, perception, and decentralized decision-making. This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations. This work jointly addresses several key limitations in prior research, namely reliance on discrete actions, single-agent or centralized formulations, assumptions of a priori knowledge and permanent connectivity, inability to handle dynamic obstacles, short planning horizons and architectural complexity in Recurrent NNs/Transformers. Results show that the scalable training paradigm, combined with a simplified architecture, enables rapid autonomous exploration of an indoor area. The implementation of Curriculum-Learning (five increasingly complex levels) also enabled faster, more robust training. This combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency establishes a strong foundation for deploying learned cooperative strategies in physical robotic systems.

Title: Spatiotemporal Decision Transformer for Traffic Coordination
Authors: Haoran Su, Yandong Sun, Hanxiao Deng
Abstract: Traffic signal control is a critical challenge in urban transportation, requiring coordination among multiple intersections to optimize network-wide traffic flow. While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.

Title: How Does the Lagrangian Guide Safe Reinforcement Learning through Diffusion Models?
Authors: Xiaoyuan Cheng, Wenxuan Yuan, Boyang Li, Yuanchao Xu, Yiming Yang, Hao Liang, Bei Peng, Robert Loftin, Zhuo Sun, Yukun Hu
Abstract: Diffusion policy sampling enables reinforcement learning (RL) to represent multimodal action distributions beyond suboptimal unimodal Gaussian policies. However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.

Title: Human-Centric Traffic Signal Control for Equity: A Multi-Agent Action Branching Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Xiaocai Zhang, Neema Nassir, Lok Sang Chan, Milad Haghani
Abstract: Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.

Title: Data-driven stabilization of continuous-time systems with noisy input-output data
Authors: Masashi Wakaiki
Abstract: We study data-driven stabilization of continuous-time systems in autoregressive form when only noisy input-output data are available. First, we provide an operator-based characterization of the set of systems consistent with the data. Next, combining this characterization with behavioral theory, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the noisy data to be informative for quadratic stabilization. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities, whose solution yields a stabilizing controller. Finally, we characterize data informativity for system identification in the noise-free setting.

Title: Geometry-Preserving Neural Architectures on Manifolds with Boundary
Authors: Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Shiba Biswal, Kian Rosenblum, Arushi Katyal, Tianli Qu, Grady Ma, Rishi Sonthalia
Abstract: Preserving geometric structure is important in learning. We propose a unified class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, where both projection layers and intrinsic exponential map updates arise as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds (with or without boundary). Within this framework, we establish universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs. We also analyze architectures that enforce geometry only at the output, proving a separate universal approximation property that enables direct comparison to interleaved designs. When the constraint set is unknown, we learn projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, showing diffusion/flow-matching can be used as data-based projections. Experiments on dynamics over S^2 and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections

Title: Function-Space Empirical Bayes Regularisation with Large Vision-Language Model Priors
Authors: Pengcheng Hao, Huaze Tang, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu, Wenbo Ding
Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) provides a principled framework for reliable uncertainty quantification by combining deep neural networks with Bayesian inference. A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.

Title: Joint Network-and-Server Congestion in Multi-Source Traffic Allocation: A Convex Formulation and Price-Based Decentralization
Authors: Tamoghna Sarkar, Bhaskar Krishnamachari
Abstract: This paper studies an important rate allocation problem that arises in many networked and distributed systems: steady-state traffic rate allocation from multiple sources to multiple service nodes when both (i) the access-path delay on each source-node route is rate-dependent (capacity-constrained) and convex, and (ii) each service node (also capacity-constrained) experiences a load-dependent queueing delay driven by aggregate load from all sources. We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.

Title: HypCBC: Domain-Invariant Hyperbolic Cross-Branch Consistency for Generalizable Medical Image Analysis
Authors: Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Jonas Alle, Christian Ledig
Abstract: Robust generalization beyond training distributions remains a critical challenge for deep neural networks. This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions.

Title: Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media
Authors: Baptiste Hériard-Dubreuil, Emma Brenner, Benjamin Rio, William Lambert, Foucauld Chamming's, Mathias Fink, Alexandre Aubry
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.

Title: LEVIO: Lightweight Embedded Visual Inertial Odometry for Resource-Constrained Devices
Authors: Jonas Kühne, Christian Vogt, Michele Magno, Luca Benini
Abstract: Accurate, infrastructure-less sensor systems for motion tracking are essential for mobile robotics and augmented reality (AR) applications. The most popular state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, however, are too computationally demanding for resource-constrained hardware, such as micro-drones and smart glasses. This work presents LEVIO, a fully featured VIO pipeline optimized for ultra-low-power compute platforms, allowing six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) real-time sensing. LEVIO incorporates established VIO components such as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature tracking and bundle adjustment, while emphasizing a computationally efficient architecture with parallelization and low memory usage to suit embedded microcontrollers and low-power systems-on-chip (SoCs). The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and adoption, the complete implementation is released as open-source.

Title: Cholesky factorisation, and intrinsically sparse linear quadratic regulation
Authors: Julia Adlercreutz, Richard Pates
Abstract: We classify a family of matrices of shift operators that can be factorised in a computationally tractable manner with the Cholesky algorithm. Such matrices arise in the linear quadratic regulator problem, and related areas. We use the factorisation to uncover intrinsic sparsity properties in the control laws for transportation problems with an underlying tree structure. This reveals that the optimal control can be applied in a distributed manner that is obscured by standard solution methods.

Title: A necessary and sufficient condition for discrete-time consensus on star boundaries
Authors: Galina Sidorenko, Johan Thunberg
Abstract: It is intuitive and well known, that if agents in a multi-agent system iteratively update their states in the Euclidean space as convex combinations of neighbors' states, all states eventually converge to the same value (consensus), provided the interaction graph is sufficiently connected. However, this seems to be also true in practice if the convex combinations of states are mapped or radially projected onto any unit $l_p$-sphere or even boundaries of star-convex sets, herein referred to as star boundaries. In this paper, we present insight into this matter by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus of the normalized states (directions) for strongly connected directed graphs, which is equivalent to asymptotic consensus of states when the star boundaries are the same for all agents. Furthermore, we show that when asymptotic consensus occurs, the states converge linearly and the point of convergence is continuous in the initial states. Assuming a directed strongly connected graph provides a more general setting than that considered, for example, in gradient-based consensus protocols, where symmetric graphs are assumed. Illustrative examples and a vast number of numerical simulations showcase the theoretical results.

Title: Efficient Sequential Neural Network with Spatial-Temporal Attention and Linear LSTM for Robust Lane Detection Using Multi-Frame Images
Authors: Sandeep Patil, Yongqi Dong, Haneen Farah, Hans Hellendoorn
Abstract: Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency. Relevant data, code, and models are released at this https URL.

Title: Joint Background-Anomaly-Noise Decomposition for Robust Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Constrained Convex Optimization
Authors: Koyo Sato, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: We propose a novel hyperspectral (HS) anomaly detection method that is robust to various types of noise. Most existing HS anomaly detection methods are designed without explicit consideration of noise or are based on the assumption of Gaussian noise. However, in real-world situations, observed HS images are often degraded by various types of noise, such as sparse noise and stripe noise, due to sensor failure or calibration errors, significantly affecting the detection performance. To address this problem, this article establishes a robust HS anomaly detection method with a mechanism that can properly remove mixed noise while separating background and anomaly parts. Specifically, we newly formulate a constrained convex optimization problem to decompose background and anomaly parts, and three types of noise from a given HS image. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned variant of a primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem. Experimental results using six real HS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves detection accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods on original images and exhibits significantly higher robustness in scenarios where various types of mixed noise are added.

Title: ResSR: A Computationally Efficient Residual Approach to Super-Resolving Multispectral Images
Authors: Haley Duba-Sullivan, Emma J. Reid, Sophie Voisin, Charles A. Bouman, Gregery T. Buzzard
Abstract: Multispectral imaging (MSI) plays a critical role in material classification, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. However, MSI sensors typically have wavelength-dependent resolution, which limits downstream analysis. MSI super-resolution (MSI-SR) methods address this limitation by reconstructing all bands at a common high spatial resolution. Existing methods can achieve high reconstruction quality but often rely on spatially-coupled optimization or large learning-based models, leading to significant computational cost and limiting their use in large-scale or time-critical settings. In this paper, we introduce ResSR, a computationally efficient, model-based MSI-SR method that achieves high-quality reconstruction without supervised training or spatially-coupled optimization. Notably, ResSR decouples spectral and spatial processing into separate branches, which are then combined in a residual correction step. The spectral branch uses singular value decomposition plus a spatially-decoupled approximate forward model to upsample the MSI, while the spatial branch uses bicubic upsampling. The residual correction step combines these branches to recover accurate spectral and spatial MSI features. ResSR achieves comparable or improved reconstruction quality relative to existing MSI-SR methods while being 2$\times$ to 10$\times$ faster. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Diff4MMLiTS: Advanced Multimodal Liver Tumor Segmentation via Diffusion-Based Image Synthesis and Alignment
Authors: Shiyun Chen, Li Lin, Pujin Cheng, ZhiCheng Jin, JianJian Chen, HaiDong Zhu, Kenneth K. Y. Wong, Xiaoying Tang
Abstract: Multimodal learning has been demonstrated to enhance performance across various clinical tasks, owing to the diverse perspectives offered by different modalities of data. However, existing multimodal segmentation methods rely on well-registered multimodal data, which is unrealistic for real-world clinical images, particularly for indistinct and diffuse regions such as liver tumors. In this paper, we introduce Diff4MMLiTS, a four-stage multimodal liver tumor segmentation pipeline: pre-registration of the target organs in multimodal CTs; dilation of the annotated modality's mask and followed by its use in inpainting to obtain multimodal normal CTs without tumors; synthesis of strictly aligned multimodal CTs with tumors using the latent diffusion model based on multimodal CT features and randomly generated tumor masks; and finally, training the segmentation model, thus eliminating the need for strictly aligned multimodal data. Extensive experiments on public and internal datasets demonstrate the superiority of Diff4MMLiTS over other state-of-the-art multimodal segmentation methods.

Title: LP-MPPI: Low-Pass Filtering for Efficient Model Predictive Path Integral Control
Authors: Piotr Kicki
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a widely used sampling-based approach for real-time control, valued for its flexibility in handling arbitrary dynamics and cost functions. However, it often suffers from high-frequency noise in the sampled control trajectories, which hinders the search for optimal controls and transfers to the applied controls, leading to actuator wear. In this work, we introduce Low-Pass Model Predictive Path Integral Control (LP-MPPI), which integrates low-pass filtering into the sampling process to eliminate detrimental high-frequency components and enhance the algorithm's efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, LP-MPPI provides direct and interpretable control over the frequency spectrum of sampled control trajectory perturbations, leading to more efficient sampling and smoother control. Through extensive evaluations in Gymnasium environments, simulated quadruped locomotion, and real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, we demonstrate that LP-MPPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MPPI variants, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing control signal chattering.

Title: Understanding-informed Bias Mitigation for Fair CMR Segmentation
Authors: Tiarna Lee, Esther Puyol-Antón, Bram Ruijsink, Pier-Giorgio Masci, Louise Keehn, Phil Chowienczyk, Emily Haseler, Miaojing Shi, Andrew P. King
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for medical imaging tasks. However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation performance and no statistically significant bias.

Title: A tutorial overview of model predictive control for continuous crystallization: current possibilities and future perspectives
Authors: Collin R. Johnson, Kerstin Wohlgemuth, Sergio Lucia
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to the advanced control of continuous crystallization processes using model predictive control. We provide a tutorial introduction to controlling complex particle size distributions by integrating population balance equations with detailed models of various continuous crystallizers. Since these high-fidelity models are often too complex for online optimization, we propose the use of data-driven surrogate models that enable efficient optimization-based control. Through two case studies, one with a low-complexity system allowing direct comparison with traditional methods and another involving a spatially distributed crystallizer, we demonstrate how our approach enables real-time model predictive control while maintaining accuracy. The presented methodology facilitates the use of complex models in a model-based control framework, allowing precise control of key particle size distribution characteristics, such as the median particle size $d_{50}$ and the width $d_{90} - d_{10}$. This addresses a critical challenge in pharmaceutical and fine chemical manufacturing, where product quality depends on tight control of particle characteristics.

Title: CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate
Authors: Hankun Wang, Yiwei Guo, Chongtian Shao, Bohan Li, Kai Yu
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 32% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates.

Title: Efficient Computation of Time-Index Powered Weighted Sums Using Cascaded Accumulators
Authors: Deijany Rodriguez Linares, Oksana Moryakova, Håkan Johansson
Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$ using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires $K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$, while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.

Title: GroundGazer: Camera-based indoor localization of mobile robots with millimeter accuracy at low cost
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Jakob Hüsken, Bohan Sun, Bin Yang
Abstract: Highly accurate indoor localization systems with mm positioning accuracy are currently very expensive. They include laser trackers, total stations, and motion capture systems relying on multiple high-end cameras. In this work, we introduce a high-accuracy, planar indoor localization system named GroundGazer (GG) for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). GG estimates the AMR's position with mm and its heading with sub-degree accuracy. The system requires only a monocular (fisheye) camera, a chessboard floor, and an optional laser diode. Our system is simple and low-cost, easy to set up, portable, robust, scalable to large areas and robot swarms, and extendable to 3D position and orientation estimation.

Title: Observer-Usable Information as a Task-specific Image Quality Metric
Authors: Changjie Lu, Sourya Sengupta, Hua Li, Mark A. Anastasio
Abstract: Objective, task-based measures of image quality (IQ) have been widely advocated for assessing and optimizing medical imaging technologies. Besides signal detection theory-based measures, information-theoretic quantities have been proposed to quantify task-based IQ. For example, task-specific information (TSI), defined as the mutual information between an image and a task variable, represents an optimal measure of how informative an image is for performing a specified task. However, like the ideal observer from signal detection theory, TSI does not quantify the amount of task-relevant information in an image that can be exploited by a sub-ideal observer. A recently proposed relaxation of TSI, termed predictive V-information (V-info), removes this limitation and can quantify the utility of an image with consideration of a specified family of sub-ideal observers. In this study, for the first time, we introduce and investigate V-info as an objective, task-specific IQ metric. To corroborate its usefulness, a stylized magnetic resonance image restoration problem is considered in which V-info is employed to quantify signal detection or discrimination performance. The presented results show that V-info correlates with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for binary tasks, while being readily applicable to multi-class (>2) tasks where ROC analysis is challenging. Notably, V-info exhibits greater sensitivity in scenarios where conventional metrics saturate. These findings demonstrate that V-info represents a new objective IQ measure that can complement conventional signal detection theory-based ones.

Title: Joint Estimation of Piano Dynamics and Metrical Structure with a Multi-task Multi-Scale Network
Authors: Zhanhong He, Hanyu Meng, David Huang, Roberto Togneri
Abstract: Estimating piano dynamic from audio recordings is a fundamental challenge in computational music analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-task network that jointly predicts dynamic levels, change points, beats, and downbeats from a shared latent representation. These four targets form the metrical structure of dynamics in the music score. Inspired by recent vocal dynamic research, we use a multi-scale network as the backbone, which takes Bark-scale specific loudness as the input feature. Compared to log-Mel as input, this reduces model size from 14.7 M to 0.5 M, enabling long sequential input. We use a 60-second audio length in audio segmentation, which doubled the length of beat tracking commonly used. Evaluated on the public MazurkaBL dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks. This work sets a new benchmark for piano dynamic estimation and delivers a powerful and compact tool, paving the way for large-scale, resource-efficient analysis of musical expression.

Title: DiffRhythm 2: Efficient and High Fidelity Song Generation via Block Flow Matching
Authors: Yuepeng Jiang, Huakang Chen, Ziqian Ning, Jixun Yao, Zerui Han, Di Wu, Meng Meng, Jian Luan, Zhonghua Fu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Generating full-length, high-quality songs is challenging, as it requires maintaining long-term coherence both across text and music modalities and within the music modality itself. Existing non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, while capable of producing high-quality songs, often struggle with the alignment between lyrics and vocal. Concurrently, catering to diverse musical preferences necessitates reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing methods often rely on merging multiple models during multi-preference optimization, which results in significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffRhythm 2, an end-to-end framework designed for high-fidelity, controllable song generation. To tackle the lyric alignment problem, DiffRhythm 2 employs a semi-autoregressive architecture based on block flow matching. This design enables faithful alignment of lyrics to singing vocals without relying on external labels and constraints, all while preserving the high generation quality and efficiency of NAR models. To make this framework computationally tractable for long sequences, we implement a music variational autoencoder (VAE) that achieves a low frame rate of 5 Hz while still enabling high-fidelity audio reconstruction. In addition, to overcome the limitations of multi-preference optimization in RLHF, we propose cross-pair preference optimization. This method effectively mitigates the performance drop typically associated with model merging, allowing for more robust optimization across diverse human preferences. We further enhance musicality and structural coherence by introducing stochastic block representation alignment loss.

Title: SPEAR: A Unified SSL Framework for Learning Speech and Audio Representations
Authors: Xiaoyu Yang, Yifan Yang, Zengrui Jin, Ziyun Cui, Wen Wu, Baoxiang Li, Chao Zhang, Phil Woodland
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has significantly advanced acoustic representation learning. However, most existing models are optimised for either speech or audio event understanding, resulting in a persistent gap between these two domains. We address this gap with SPEAR (SPEech and Audio Representations), a self-supervised framework that distils complementary knowledge from a speech-focused SSL teacher and a general-audio SSL teacher into a single unified model. SPEAR applies multi-codebook vector quantisation to continuous teacher representations to produce fine-grained discrete tokens that capture both semantic and acoustic information. To effectively integrate these heterogeneous representations, SPEAR jointly predicts them given a masked input with an asymmetric pre-training loss. We further improve robustness in complex sound scenes through a novel token mixing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPEAR consistently outperforms existing unified speech and audio models. SPEAR establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SUPERB benchmark, surpassing WavLM Large on 12 of 15 tasks, while achieving competitive performance on the HEAR benchmark. These results position SPEAR as a versatile foundation for general-purpose speech and audio representation learning. The code and pre-trained models will be released.

Title: On the Performance of Tri-Hybrid Beamforming Using Pinching Antennas
Authors: Zhenqiao Cheng, Chongjun Ouyang, Nicola Marchetti
Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna System (PASS) reconfigures wireless channels through \emph{pinching beamforming}, in which the active positions of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides are optimized to shape the radiation pattern. This article investigates the performance of PASS-enabled tri-hybrid beamforming, where pinched waveguides are integrated with a hybrid digital-analog beamformer to mitigate path loss and enhance spectral efficiency. The channel capacity of the proposed system is characterized by deriving the optimal tri-hybrid beamformer at both the digital and analog domains, as well as the optimal placement of PAs. Closed-form upper and lower bounds of the channel capacity are obtained, leading to a capacity scaling law with respect to the number of PAs. Numerical results verify the tightness of the derived bounds and demonstrate that applying PASS to tri-hybrid beamforming yields a significant performance gain over conventional hybrid beamforming under the same number of radio-frequency chains.

Title: AIRMap: AI-Generated Radio Maps for Wireless Digital Twins
Authors: Ali Saeizadeh, Miead Tehrani-Moayyed, Davide Villa, J. Gordon Beattie Jr., Pedram Johari, Stefano Basagni, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency channel modeling is essential for real-time wireless network simulation and digital-twin applications. Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained on 1.2M Boston-area samples and validated across four distinct urban and rural environments with varying terrain and building density, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 4 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S-over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 5%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins.

Title: An End-to-End Approach for Microgrid Probabilistic Forecasting and Robust Operation via Decision-focused Learning
Authors: Tingwei Cao, Yan Xu
Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.

Title: Fetpype: An Open-Source Pipeline for Reproducible Fetal Brain MRI Analysis
Authors: Thomas Sanchez, Gerard Martí-Juan, David Meunier, Miguel Angel Gonzalez Ballester, Oscar Camara, Elisenda Eixarch, Gemma Piella, Meritxell Bach Cuadra, Guillaume Auzias
Abstract: Fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for assessing neurodevelopment in utero. However, fetal MRI analysis remains technically challenging due to fetal motion, low signal-to-noise ratio, and the need for complex multi-step processing pipelines. These pipelines typically include motion correction, super-resolution reconstruction, tissue segmentation, and cortical surface extraction. While specialized tools exist for each individual processing step, integrating them into a robust, reproducible, and user-friendly end-to-end workflow remains difficult. This fragmentation limits reproducibility across studies and hinders the adoption of advanced fetal neuroimaging methods in both research and clinical contexts. Fetpype addresses this gap by providing a standardized, modular, and reproducible framework for fetal brain MRI preprocessing and analysis, enabling researchers to process raw T2-weighted acquisitions through to derived volumetric and surface-based outputs within a unified workflow. Fetpype is publicly available on GitHub at this https URL.

Title: Comprehensive Machine Learning Benchmarking for Fringe Projection Profilometry with Photorealistic Synthetic Data
Authors: Anush Lakshman S, Adam Haroon, Beiwen Li
Abstract: Machine learning approaches for fringe projection profilometry (FPP) are hindered by the lack of large, diverse datasets and standardized benchmarking protocols. This paper introduces the first open-source, photorealistic synthetic dataset for FPP, generated using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, comprising 15,600 fringe images and 300 depth reconstructions across 50 objects. We apply this dataset to single-shot FPP, where models predict 3D depth maps directly from individual fringe images without temporal phase shifting. Through systematic ablation studies, we identify optimal learning configurations for long-range (1.5-2.1 m) depth prediction. We compare three depth normalization strategies and show that individual normalization, which decouples object shape from absolute scale, yields a 9.1x improvement in object reconstruction accuracy over raw depth. We further show that removing background fringe patterns severely degrades performance across all normalizations, demonstrating that background fringes provide essential spatial phase reference rather than noise. We evaluate six loss functions and identify Hybrid L1 loss as optimal. Using the best configuration, we benchmark four architectures and find UNet achieves the strongest performance, though errors remain far above the sub-millimeter accuracy of classical FPP. The small performance gap between architectures indicates that the dominant limitation is information deficit rather than model design: single fringe images lack sufficient information for accurate depth recovery without explicit phase cues. This work provides a standardized benchmark and evidence motivating hybrid approaches combining phase-based FPP with learned refinement. The dataset is available at this https URL and code at this https URL.

Title: Approximating Univariate Factored Distributions via Message-Passing Algorithms
Authors: Zilu Zhao, Dirk Slock
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) commonly arise in communication systems, particularly in bilinear joint estimation and detection problems. Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions.

Title: RIR-Former: Coordinate-Guided Transformer for Continuous Reconstruction of Room Impulse Responses
Authors: Shaoheng Xu, Chunyi Sun, Jihui Zhang, Prasanga N. Samarasinghe, Thushara D. Abhayapala
Abstract: Room impulse responses (RIRs) are essential for many acoustic signal processing tasks, yet measuring them densely across space is often impractical. In this work, we propose RIR-Former, a grid-free, one-step feed-forward model for RIR reconstruction. By introducing a sinusoidal encoding module into a transformer backbone, our method effectively incorporates microphone position information, enabling interpolation at arbitrary array locations. Furthermore, a segmented multi-branch decoder is designed to separately handle early reflections and late reverberation, improving reconstruction across the entire RIR. Experiments on diverse simulated acoustic environments demonstrate that RIR-Former consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and cosine distance (CD), under varying missing rates and array configurations. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical deployment and motivate future work on scaling from randomly spaced linear arrays to complex array geometries, dynamic acoustic scenes, and real-world environments.

Title: AlignAtt: Using Attention-based Audio-Translation Alignments as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Sara Papi, Marco Turchi, Matteo Negri
Abstract: Attention is the core mechanism of today's most used architectures for natural language processing and has been analyzed from many perspectives, including its effectiveness for machine translation-related tasks. Among these studies, attention resulted to be a useful source of information to get insights about word alignment also when the input text is substituted with audio segments, as in the case of the speech translation (ST) task. In this paper, we propose AlignAtt, a novel policy for simultaneous ST (SimulST) that exploits the attention information to generate source-target alignments that guide the model during inference. Through experiments on the 8 language pairs of MuST-C v1.0, we show that AlignAtt outperforms previous state-of-the-art SimulST policies applied to offline-trained models with gains in terms of BLEU of 2 points and latency reductions ranging from 0.5s to 0.8s across the 8 languages.

Title: Certainty-Equivalence Model Predictive Control: Stability, Performance, and Beyond
Authors: Changrui Liu, Shengling Shi, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is effective, its conservatism often makes it less desirable. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which uses a nominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and low computational costs. This paper investigates CE-MPC for uncertain nonlinear systems with multiplicative parametric uncertainty and input constraints that are inactive at the steady state. The primary contributions are two-fold. First, a novel perturbation analysis of the MPC value function is provided, without assuming the Lipschitz continuity of the stage cost, better tailoring the widely used quadratic cost and having broader applicability in value function approximation, learning-based MPC, and performance-driven MPC design. Second, the stability and performance analysis of CE-MPC are provided, quantifying the suboptimality of CE-MPC compared to the infinite-horizon optimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide insights in how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect stability and the worst-case performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to linear quadratic control, and a competitive ratio bound is derived, serving as the first competitive-ratio bound for MPC of uncertain linear systems with input constraints and multiplicative uncertainty.

Title: An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models
Authors: Laura Balzano, Tianjiao Ding, Benjamin D. Haeffele, Soo Min Kwon, Qing Qu, Peng Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Can Yaras
Abstract: The substantial computational demands of modern large-scale deep learning present significant challenges for efficient training and deployment. Recent research has revealed a widespread phenomenon wherein deep networks inherently learn low-rank structures in their weights and representations during training. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive review of advances in identifying and exploiting these low-rank structures, bridging mathematical foundations with practical applications. We present two complementary theoretical perspectives on the emergence of low-rankness: viewing it through the optimization dynamics of gradient descent throughout training, and understanding it as a result of implicit regularization effects at convergence. Practically, these theoretical perspectives provide a foundation for understanding the success of techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning, inspire new parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies, and explain the effectiveness of masked training approaches like dropout and masked self-supervised learning.

Title: Lightweight and Interpretable Transformer via Mixed Graph Algorithm Unrolling for Traffic Forecast
Authors: Ji Qi, Tam Thuc Do, Mingxiao Liu, Zhuoshi Pan, Yuzhe Li, Gene Cheung, H. Vicky Zhao
Abstract: Unlike conventional "black-box" transformers with classical self-attention mechanism, we build a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net by unrolling a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm to forecast traffic with spatial and temporal dimensions. We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We periodically insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.

Title: AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: Guangke Chen, Fu Song, Zhe Zhao, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Yanchen Qiao, Weizhe Zhang, Weiping Tu, Yuhong Yang, Bo Du
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they exclusively focused on the attack scenario where the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts (named strong adversary) and limited in effectiveness, applicability, and practicability. In this work, we first conduct an extensive evaluation showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to-speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AUDIOJAILBREAK, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audios do not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into the perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios is concealed by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating reverberation into the perturbation generation. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, and/or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AUDIOJAILBREAK is also applicable to a more practical and broader attack scenario where the adversary cannot fully manipulate user prompts (named weak adversary). Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AUDIOJAILBREAK, in particular, it can jailbreak openAI's GPT-4o-Audio and bypass Meta's Llama-Guard-3 safeguard, in the weak adversary scenario. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their robustness, especially for the newly proposed weak adversary.

Title: The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators
Authors: Ali Karimi, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Youssef Kora, Christoph Simon
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in forecasting both linear and nonlinear time-series depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average -- up to a threshold in the input frequency -- that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.

Title: L2M-Reg: Building-level Uncertainty-aware Registration of Outdoor LiDAR Point Clouds and Semantic 3D City Models
Authors: Ziyang Xu, Benedikt Schwab, Yihui Yang, Thomas H. Kolbe, Christoph Holst
Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction, change detection, and model refinement. However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at the individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Overall, extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than current leading ICP-based and plane-based methods. Therefore, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present. The datasets and code for L2M-Reg can be found: this https URL.

Title: Evaluating High-Resolution Piano Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation with Musically Informed Metrics
Authors: Hanwen Zhang, Kun Fang, Ziyu Wang, Ichiro Fujinaga
Abstract: Evaluation for continuous piano pedal depth estimation tasks remains incomplete when relying only on conventional frame-level metrics, which overlook musically important features such as direction-change boundaries and pedal curve contours. To provide more interpretable and musically meaningful insights, we propose an evaluation framework that augments standard frame-level metrics with an action-level assessment measuring direction and timing using segments of press/hold/release states and a gesture-level analysis that evaluates contour similarity of each press-release cycle. We apply this framework to compare an audio-only baseline with two variants: one incorporating symbolic information from MIDI, and another trained in a binary-valued setting, all within a unified architecture. Results show that the MIDI-informed model significantly outperforms the others at action and gesture levels, despite modest frame-level gains. These findings demonstrate that our framework captures musically relevant improvements indiscernible by traditional metrics, offering a more practical and effective approach to evaluating pedal depth estimation models.

Title: Modeling Sarcastic Speech: Semantic and Prosodic Cues in a Speech Synthesis Framework
Authors: Zhu Li, Yuqing Zhang, Xiyuan Gao, Shekhar Nayak, Matt Coler
Abstract: Sarcasm is a pragmatic phenomenon in which speakers convey meanings that diverge from literal content, relying on an interaction between semantics and prosodic expression. However, how these cues jointly contribute to the recognition of sarcasm remains poorly understood. We propose a computational framework that models sarcasm as the integration of semantic interpretation and prosodic realization. Semantic cues are derived from an LLaMA 3 model fine-tuned to capture discourse-level markers of sarcastic intent, while prosodic cues are extracted through semantically aligned utterances drawn from a database of sarcastic speech, providing prosodic exemplars of sarcastic delivery. Using a speech synthesis testbed, perceptual evaluations demonstrate that both semantic and prosodic cues independently enhance listeners' perception of sarcasm, with the strongest effects emerging when the two are combined. These findings highlight the complementary roles of semantics and prosody in pragmatic interpretation and illustrate how modeling can shed light on the mechanisms underlying sarcastic communication.

Title: A High-Performance Training-Free Pipeline for Robust Random Telegraph Signal Characterization via Adaptive Wavelet-Based Denoising and Bayesian Digitization Methods
Authors: Tonghe Bai, Ayush Kapoor, Na Young Kim
Abstract: Random telegraph signal (RTS) analysis is increasingly important for characterizing meaningful temporal fluctuations in physical, chemical, and biological systems. The simplest RTS arises from discrete stochastic switching events between two binary states, quantified by their transition amplitude and dwell times in each state. Quantitative analysis of RTSs provides valuable insights into microscopic processes such as charge trapping in semiconductors. However, analyzing RTS becomes considerably complex when signals exhibit multi-level structures or are corrupted by background white or pink noise. To address these challenges and support high-throughput RTS characterization, we propose a modular, training-free signal processing pipeline that integrates adaptive dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) denoising with a lightweight Bayesian digitization strategy. The adaptive DTCWT denoiser incorporates autonomous parameter selection rules for its decomposition level and thresholds, optimizing white noise suppression without manual tuning. Our Bayesian digitizer formulates RTS level assignment as a probabilistic latent-state inference problem incorporating temporal regularization without iterative optimization, effectively resolving binary trap states even under residual notorious background pink noise. Quantitative benchmarking on large synthetic datasets with known ground truth demonstrates improved RTS reconstruction accuracy, trap-state resolution, and dwell-time estimation across diverse noise regimes and multi-trap scenarios, while achieving up to 83x speedups over classical and neural baselines. Qualitative validation on experimental RTS data when no ground truth is available illustrates practical usability and flexibility for real-time or large-scale analysis in real measurement settings.

Title: S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction
Authors: Tiezhi Wang, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Title: Bayesian Speech Synthesizers Can Learn from Multiple Teachers
Authors: Ziyang Zhang, Yifan Gao, Xuenan Xu, Baoxiang Li, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) is inherently a "one-to-many" mapping characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, yet current paradigms often oversimplify it into a deterministic regression task. While continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to discrete codec-based approaches, they typically rely on a fixed-variance prior, fundamentally constraining generation to a static point estimate that ignores the dynamic variability of natural speech. To bridge this gap, we propose BELLE (Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling), a framework that shifts from deterministic prediction to principled Bayesian inference without increasing model parameters or inference latency. By modeling the acoustic target as a Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution, BELLE captures data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. To enable accurate variance estimation on standard single-reference datasets, we introduce a "one-to-many" training strategy that leverages synthetic samples as a statistical support set, allowing the model to learn robust distributional properties rather than merely imitating teacher artifacts. Experiments demonstrate that BELLE, trained on only ~5k hours of data, outperforms leading open-source models trained on 50k hours (achieving a 25.8% relative WER reduction) and naturally supports high-quality streaming generation.

Title: MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control
Authors: Yongwei Zhang, Yuanzhe Xing, Quanyi Liang, Quan Quan, Zhikun She
Abstract: For safety-critical applications, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) faces numerous challenges, particularly the difficulty of establishing verifiable stability guarantees while maintaining high exploration efficiency. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates (MSACL), a novel approach that seamlessly integrates exponential stability with maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL). In contrast to existing methods that rely on complex reward engineering and single-step constraints, MSACL utilizes intuitive rewards and multi-step data for actor-critic learning. Specifically, we first introduce Exponential Stability Labels (ESLs) to categorize samples and propose a $\lambda$-weighted aggregation mechanism to learn Lyapunov certificates. Leveraging these certificates, we then develop a stability-aware advantage function to guide policy optimization, thereby ensuring rapid Lyapunov descent and robust state convergence. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, comprising four stabilization and two high-dimensional tracking tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its consistent superiority over both standard RL baselines and state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. Beyond rapid convergence, MSACL exhibits significant robustness against environmental uncertainties and remarkable generalization to unseen reference signals.

Title: Do Models Hear Like Us? Probing the Representational Alignment of Audio LLMs and Naturalistic EEG
Authors: Haoyun Yang, Xin Xiao, Jiang Zhong, Yu Tian, Dong Xiaohua, Yu Mao, Hao Wu, Kaiwen Wei
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.

Title: Time2Vec Transformer for Robust Gesture Recognition from Low-Density sEMG
Authors: Blagoj Hristov, Hristijan Gjoreski, Vesna Ojleska Latkoska, Gorjan Nadzinski
Abstract: Accurate and responsive myoelectric prosthesis control typically relies on complex, dense multi-sensor arrays, which limits consumer accessibility. This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing. The proposed framework offers a robust, cost-effective blueprint for next-generation prosthetic interfaces capable of rapid personalization.

Title: DCoPilot: Generative AI-Empowered Policy Adaptation for Dynamic Data Center Operations
Authors: Minghao Li, Ruihang Wang, Rui Tan, Yonggang Wen
Abstract: Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.

Title: Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL
Authors: Julian Lemmel, Felix Resch, Mónika Farsang, Ramin Hasani, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.
