Title: Slow - Motion Video Synthesis for Basketball Using Frame Interpolation
Authors: Jiantang Huang
Abstract: Basketball broadcast footage is traditionally captured at 30-60 fps, limiting viewers' ability to appreciate rapid plays such as dunks and crossovers. We present a real-time slow-motion synthesis system that produces high-quality basketball-specific interpolated frames by fine-tuning the recent Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation (RIFE) network on the SportsSloMo dataset. Our pipeline isolates the basketball subset of SportsSloMo, extracts training triplets, and fine-tunes RIFE with human-aware random cropping. We compare the resulting model against Super SloMo and the baseline RIFE model using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) on held-out clips. The fine-tuned RIFE attains a mean PSNR of 34.3 dB and SSIM of 0.949, outperforming Super SloMo by 2.1 dB and the baseline RIFE by 1.3 dB. A lightweight Gradio interface demonstrates end-to-end 4x slow-motion generation on a single RTX 4070 Ti Super at approximately 30 fps. These results indicate that task-specific adaptation is crucial for sports slow-motion, and that RIFE provides an attractive accuracy-speed trade-off for consumer applications.

Title: Weyl-Heisenberg Transform Capabilities in JPEG Compression Standard
Authors: V. Asiryan, V. Volchkov, N. Papulovskaya
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the development and research of a new compression technology based on Weyl-Heisenberg bases (WH-technology) for modifying the JPEG compression standard and improving its characteristics. For this purpose, the paper analyzes the main stages of the JPEG compression algorithm, notes its key features and problems that limit further enhancement of its efficiency. To overcome these limitations, it is proposed to use the real version of the two-dimensional discrete orthogonal Weyl-Heisenberg transform (DWHT) instead of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the stage of transformation coding. This transformation, unlike DCT, initially has a block structure and is built on the basis of the Weyl-Heisenberg optimal signal basis, the functions of which are orthogonal and well localized both in the frequency and time domains. This feature of DWHT allows for more efficient decorrelation and compression of element values in each block of the image after transformation coding. As a result, it is possible to obtain more efficient selection and screening of insignificant elements at the subsequent stages of quantization and information coding. Based on DWHT, a new version of the JPEG compression algorithm was developed, and convenient criteria for evaluating the compression efficiency and metrics of quality losses were proposed. The results of an experimental study are presented, confirming the higher compression efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the JPEG compression standard.

Title: Inverted C-Shaped Slots Loaded Exponential Tapered Triple Band Notched Ultra Wideband (UWB) Antenna
Authors: Olaoluwa A. Adegboye, Kufre M. Udofia, Akaninyene Obot
Abstract: This research presents a simple strategy for designing an exponentially tapered, triple-notched ultrawideband antenna. The antenna's microstrip line feed and radiating patch are matched using an exponential tapered transformer. This method inserts antenna notch elements, by cutting two inverted C-shaped slots in the radiating patch; frequency rejection can be achieved for WI-MAX and wireless LAN. The X-band is rejected by etching a U-shaped slot in the feedline. When embedding the notch elements, cross-coupling was minimized. The desired antenna was designed, simulated, and measured. The measured results and graphs show that our proposed design is reliable. This band notched antenna rejects 3.5 GHz (Wi-MAX band, 3.3 to 3.7 GHz), 5.5 GHz (WLAN 2 band, 5.15 to 5.825 GHz), and 7.5 GHz (for satellite downlink X - band-7.25 GHz to 7.75 GHz). The proposed antenna meets UWB design requirements.

Title: Neural Network-Augmented Iterative Learning Control for Friction Compensation of Motion Control Systems with Varying Disturbances
Authors: Ali Mashhadireza, Ali Sadighi
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust control strategy that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a simple lateral neural network to enhance the trajectory tracking performance of a linear Lorentz force actuator under friction and model uncertainties. The ILC compensates for nonlinear friction effects, while the neural network estimates the nonlinear ILC effort for varying reference commands. By dynamically adjusting the ILC effort, the method adapts to time-varying friction, reduces errors at reference changes, and accelerates convergence. Compared to previous approaches using complex neural networks, this method simplifies online training and implementation, making it practical for real-time applications. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness in achieving precise tracking across multiple tasks with different reference trajectories.

Title: Emulation-based Neuromorphic Control for the Stabilization of LTI Systems
Authors: Elena Petri, Koen J.A. Scheres, Erik Steur, W.P.M.H. (Maurice)Heemels
Abstract: Brain-inspired neuromorphic technologies can offer important advantages over classical digital clock-based technologies in various domains, including systems and control engineering. Indeed, neuromorphic engineering could provide low-latency, low-energy and adaptive control systems in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploiting spike-based control and communication. However, systematic methods for designing and analyzing neuron-inspired spiking controllers are currently lacking. This paper presents a new systematic approach for stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using SNN-based controllers, designed as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, whose input is the measured output from the plant and generating spiking control signals. The new approach consists of a two-step emulation-based design procedure. In the first step, we establish conditions on the neuron parameters to ensure that the spiking signal generated by a pair of neurons emulates any continuous-time signal input to the neurons with arbitrary accuracy in terms of a special metric for spiky signals. In the second step, we propose a novel stability notion, called integral spiking-input-to-state stability (iSISS) building on this special metric. We prove that an asymptotically stable LTI system has this iSISS property. By combining these steps, a certifiable practical stability property of the closed-loop system can be established. Generalizations are discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a numerical case study.

Title: Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical and Finite-Time Constrained Control
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both safety and feasibility under sampled-data implementations is crucial for practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, such as High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively guarantee safety in continuous time but may become unsafe when executed under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers due to inter-sampling effects. Moreover, they do not explicitly handle finite-time reach-and-remain requirements or multiple simultaneous constraints, which often lead to conflicts between safety and reach-and-remain objectives, resulting in feasibility issues during control synthesis. This paper introduces Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions (SACBFs), a unified framework that accounts for sampling effects and high relative-degree constraints by estimating and incorporating Taylor-based upper bounds on barrier evolution between sampling instants. The proposed method guarantees continuous-time forward invariance of safety and finite-time reach-and-remain sets under ZOH control. To further improve feasibility, a relaxed variant (r-SACBF) introduces slack variables for handling multiple constraints realized through time-varying CBFs. Simulation studies on a unicycle robot demonstrate that SACBFs achieve safe and feasible performance in scenarios where traditional HOCBF methods fail.

Title: A Deep Learning Framework for Thyroid Nodule Segmentation and Malignancy Classification from Ultrasound Images
Authors: Omar Abdelrazik, Mohamed Elsayed, Noorul Wahab, Nasir Rajpoot, Adam Shephard
Abstract: Ultrasound-based risk stratification of thyroid nodules is a critical clinical task, but it suffers from high inter-observer variability. While many deep learning (DL) models function as "black boxes," we propose a fully automated, two-stage framework for interpretable malignancy prediction. Our method achieves interpretability by forcing the model to focus only on clinically relevant regions. First, a TransUNet model automatically segments the thyroid nodule. The resulting mask is then used to create a region of interest around the nodule, and this localised image is fed directly into a ResNet-18 classifier. We evaluated our framework using 5-fold cross-validation on a clinical dataset of 349 images, where it achieved a high F1-score of 0.852 for predicting malignancy. To validate its performance, we compared it against a strong baseline using a Random Forest classifier with hand-crafted morphological features, which achieved an F1-score of 0.829. The superior performance of our DL framework suggests that the implicit visual features learned from the localised nodule are more predictive than explicit shape features alone. This is the first fully automated end-to-end pipeline for both detecting thyroid nodules on ultrasound images and predicting their malignancy.

Title: AI-Open-RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Tri Nhu Do
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of AIO-RAN-NTN, a unified all-in-one Radio Access Network (RAN) for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), built on an open architecture that leverages open interfaces and artificial intelligence (AI)-based functionalities. This approach advances interoperability, flexibility, and intelligence in next-generation telecommunications. First, we provide a concise overview of the state-of-the-art architectures for Open-RAN and AI-RAN, highlighting key network functions and infrastructure elements. Next, we introduce our integrated AIO-RAN-NTN blueprint, emphasizing how internal and air interfaces from AIO-RAN and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) can be applied to emerging environments such as NTNs. To examine the impact of mobility on AIO-RAN, we implement a testbed transmission using the OpenAirInterface platform for a standalone (SA) New Radio (NR) 5G system. We then train an AI model on realistic data to forecast key performance indicators (KPIs). Our experiments demonstrate that the AIO-based SA architecture is sensitive to mobility, even at low speeds, but this limitation can be mitigated through AI-driven KPI forecasting.

Title: Temporal Micro-Doppler Spectrogram-based ViT Multiclass Target Classification
Authors: Nghia Thinh Nguyen, Tri Nhu Do
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Temporal MDS-Vision Transformer (T-MDS-ViT) for multiclass target classification using millimeter-wave FMCW radar micro-Doppler spectrograms. Specifically, we design a transformer-based architecture that processes stacked range-velocity-angle (RVA) spatiotemporal tensors via patch embeddings and cross-axis attention mechanisms to explicitly model the sequential nature of MDS data across multiple frames. The T-MDS-ViT exploits mobility-aware constraints in its attention layer correspondences to maintain separability under target overlaps and partial occlusions. Next, we apply an explainable mechanism to examine how the attention layers focus on characteristic high-energy regions of the MDS representations and their effect on class-specific kinematic features. We also demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing CNN-based methods in terms of classification accuracy while achieving better data efficiency and real-time deployability.

Title: Noisy MRI Reconstruction via MAP Estimation with an Implicit Deep-Denoiser Prior
Authors: Nikola Janjušević, Amirhossein Khalilian-Gourtani, Yao Wang, Li Feng
Abstract: Accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging, particularly under realistic acquisition noise. While diffusion models have recently shown promise for reconstructing undersampled MRI data, many approaches lack an explicit link to the underlying MRI physics, and their parameters are sensitive to measurement noise, limiting their reliability in practice. We introduce Implicit-MAP (ImMAP), a diffusion-based reconstruction framework that integrates the acquisition noise model directly into a maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Specifically, we build on the stochastic ascent method of Kadkhodaie et al. and generalize it to handle MRI encoding operators and realistic measurement noise. Across both simulated and real noisy datasets, ImMAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning (LPDSNet) and diffusion-based (DDS) methods. By clarifying the practical behavior and limitations of diffusion models under realistic noise conditions, ImMAP establishes a more reliable and interpretable

Title: Resource Allocation for Transmissive RIS Transceiver Enabled SWIPT Systems
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Xudong Bai, Chong He, Qiong Wu
Abstract: A novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) framework is proposed. The sum-rate of the information decoding (ID) users is maximized by optimizing the TRIS transceiver's beamforming, subject to the energy harvesting (EH) users' quality-of-harvest and the per-antenna power constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm. First, the original problem is reformulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP problem is then addressed using successive convex approximation (SCA) combined with a penalty-based method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Title: Beamforming for Transmissive RIS Transmitter Enabled Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Yanze Zhu, Zhendong Li, Qiong Wu, Kunlun Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with multiple information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) users. Under the considered system model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the sum-rate of all ID users via the design of the TRIS transceiver's active beamforming. The design is constrained by per-antenna power limits at the TRIS transceiver and by the minimum harvested energy demand of all EH users. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and the energy harvesting constraint, the sum-rate problem is difficult to tackle. To solve this challenging optimization problem, by leveraging the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework and the majorization-minimization (MM) method, we propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based algorithm. Per-element power constraints introduce a large number of constraints, making the problem considerably more difficult. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method, we successfully develop an analytical, computationally efficient, and highly parallelizable algorithm to address this challenge. Numerical results are provided to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the low-complexity algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity without performance degradation.

Title: On The Detection of Minimum Forecast Horizon For Real-Time Scheduling of Energy Storage Systems in Smart Grid
Authors: Nicholas Tetteh Ofoe, Weilun Wang, Lei Wu
Abstract: The increasing integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) into power grids has necessitated effective real-time control strategies under uncertain and volatile electricity prices. An important problem of model predictive control of ESSs is identifying the minimum forecast horizon needed to exactly simulate the globally optimal control trajectory. Existing methods in the literature provide only sufficient conditions and might ignore real-world inconsistencies in control actions. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure.

Title: MUSTEM: A Dual-Modality System for Vibrotactile and Visual Translation of Music as an Assistive Technology
Authors: Paloma Sette, Maria Werneck, William Barbosa, Ana Loubacker
Abstract: The emotional and structural experience of music remains a significant accessibility challenge for the deaf and hard of hearing community. This paper introduces MUSTEM (Multisensorial Emotional Translation), a novel system designed to translate music into a rich, coherent, and scientifically-grounded sensory experience. We present a dual-modality approach addressing this challenge through two interconnected components. First, a low-cost, portable hardware prototype that performs real-time audio analysis, mapping distinct frequency bands (sub-bass, bass, mid-range, treble) to a four-channel vibrotactile system, allowing users to feel the music's rhythmic and foundational structure. Second, to overcome the processing limitations of embedded hardware, we developed a high-fidelity software simulation that demonstrates the full potential of the visual translation. This assistive dashboard decodes musical components - such as rhythm, harmony, and frequency spectrum - into an intuitive and educational visual interface. MUSTEM offers a comprehensive framework for sensory substitution, presenting a viable and accessible pathway for the deaf community to experience music not just as vibration, but as a structured, substantiated and emotionally resonant visual and tactile language. Preliminary feedback from seven deaf users suggests the system's spatial vibrotactile mapping is perceptible and engaging. All source code and hardware designs are released as open-source. Video demonstrations and open-source code are available on the project's official channel.

Title: Near-Real-Time InSAR Phase Estimation for Large-Scale Surface Displacement Monitoring
Authors: Scott Staniewicz, Sara Mirzaee, Heresh Fattahi, Talib Oliver-Cabrera, Emre Havazli, Geoffrey Gunter, Se-Yeon Jeon, Mary Grace Bato, Jinwoo Kim, Simran S. Sangha, Bruce Chapman, Alexander L. Handwerger, Marin Govorcin, Piyush Agram, David Bekaert
Abstract: Operational near-real-time monitoring of Earth's surface deformation using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) requires processing algorithms that efficiently incorporate new acquisitions without reprocessing historical archives. We present sequential phase linking approach using compressed single-look-complex images (SLCs) capable of producing surface displacement estimates within hours of the time of a new acquisition. Our key algorithmic contribution is a mini-stack reference scheme that maintains phase consistency across processing batches without adjusting or re-estimating previous time steps, enabling straightforward operational deployment. We introduce online methods for persistent and distributed scatterer identification that adapt to temporal changes in surface properties through incremental amplitude statistics updates. The processing chain incorporates multiple complementary metrics for pixel quality that are reliable for small SLC stack sizes, and an L1-norm network inversion to limit propagation of unwrapping errors across the time series. We use our algorithm to produce OPERA Surface Displacement from Sentinel-1 product, the first continental-scale surface displacement product over North America. Validation against GPS measurements and InSAR residual analysis demonstrates millimeter-level agreement in velocity estimates in varying environmental conditions. We demonstrate our algorithm's capabilities with a successful recovery of meter-scale co-eruptive displacement at Kilauea volcano during the 2018 eruption, as well as detection of subtle uplift at Three Sisters volcano, Oregon- a challenging environment for C-band InSAR due to dense vegetation and seasonal snow. We have made all software available as open source libraries, providing a significant advancement to the open scientific community's ability to process large InSAR data sets in a cloud environment.

Title: Real-Time Physics-Aware Battery Health Monitoring from Partial Charging Profiles via Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Xubo Gu, Xun Huan, Yao Ren, Wenqing Zhou, Weiran Jiang, Ziyou Song
Abstract: Monitoring battery health is essential for ensuring safe and efficient operation. However, there is an inherent trade-off between assessment speed and diagnostic depth-specifically, between rapid overall health estimation and precise identification of internal degradation states. Capturing detailed internal battery information efficiently remains a major challenge, yet such insights are key to understanding the various degradation mechanisms. To address this, we develop a parameterized physics-informed neural network (P-PINNSPM) over the key aging-related parameter space for a single particle model. The model can accurately predict internal battery variables across the parameter space and identifies internal parameters in about 30 seconds-achieving a 47x speedup over the finite volume method-while maintaining high accuracy. These parameters improve the battery state-of-health (SOH) estimation accuracy by at least 60.61%, compared to models without parameter incorporation. Moreover, they enable extrapolation to unseen SOH levels and support robust estimation across diverse charging profiles and operating conditions. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of physics-informed machine learning to advance real-time, data-efficient, and physics-aware battery management systems.

Title: Informed Bootstrap Augmentation Improves EEG Decoding
Authors: Woojae Jeong, Wenhui Cui, Kleanthis Avramidis, Takfarinas Medani, Shrikanth Narayanan, Richard Leahy
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers detailed access to neural dynamics but remains constrained by noise and trial-by-trial variability, limiting decoding performance in data-restricted or complex paradigms. Data augmentation is often employed to enhance feature representations, yet conventional uniform averaging overlooks differences in trial informativeness and can degrade representational quality. We introduce a weighted bootstrapping approach that prioritizes more reliable trials to generate higher-quality augmented samples. In a Sentence Evaluation paradigm, weights were computed from relative ERP differences and applied during probabilistic sampling and averaging. Across conditions, weighted bootstrapping improved decoding accuracy relative to unweighted (from 68.35% to 71.25% at best), demonstrating that emphasizing reliable trials strengthens representational quality. The results demonstrate that reliability-based augmentation yields more robust and discriminative EEG representations. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Bayesian Learning Aided Simultaneous Sparse Estimation of Dual-Wideband THz Channels in Multi-User Hybrid MIMO Systems
Authors: Abhisha Garg, Akash Kumar, Suraj Srivastava, Nimish Yadav, Aditya K. Jagannatham, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: This work conceives the Bayesian Group-Sparse Regression (BGSR) for the estimation of a spatial and frequency wideband, i.e., a dual wideband channel in Multi-User (MU) THz hybrid MIMO scenarios. We develop a practical dual wideband THz channel model that incorporates absorption losses, reflection losses, diffused ray modeling and angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs) using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Furthermore, a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is employed at each RF chain, which is crucial for wideband THz massive MIMO systems to reduce power consumption and hardware complexity, given the high sampling rates and large number of antennas involved. The quantized MU THz MIMO model is linearized using the popular Bussgang decomposition followed by BGSR based channel learning framework that results in sparsity across different subcarriers, where each subcarrier has its unique dictionary matrix. Next, the Bayesian Cramér Rao Bound (BCRB) is devised for bounding the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance. Extensive simulations were performed to assess the performance improvements achieved by the proposed BGSR method compared to other sparse estimation techniques. The metrics considered for quantifying the performance improvements include the NMSE and bit error rate (BER).

Title: Volumetric Ultrasound via 3D Null Subtraction Imaging with Circular and Spiral Apertures
Authors: Bingze Dai, Xi Zhang, Wei-Ning Lee
Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound imaging faces a fundamental trade-off among image quality, frame rate, and hardware complexity. This study introduces three-dimensional Null Subtraction Imaging (3D NSI), a nonlinear beamforming framework that addresses this trade-off by combining computationally efficient null-subtraction process with multiplexing-aware sparse aperture designs on matrix arrays. We evaluate three apodization configurations: a fully addressed circular aperture and two Fermat's spiral sparse apertures. To overcome channel-sharing constraints common in matrix arrays multiplexed with low-channel-count ultrasound systems, we propose a spiral "no-reuse" apodization that enforces non-overlapping element sets across transmit-receive events. This design resolves multiplexing conflicts and enables up to a 16-fold increase in acquisition volume rate using only 240 active elements on a 1024-element probe. In computer simulations and tissue-mimicking phantom experiments, 3D NSI achieved an average improvement of 36% in azimuthal and elevational resolutions, along with an approximately 20% higher contrast ratio, compared to the conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer under matched transmit/receive configurations. When implemented with the spiral no-reuse aperture, the 3D NSI framework achieved over 1000 volumes per second with a computational load less than three times that of DAS, making it a practical solution for real-time 4D imaging.

Title: A 24-GHz CMOS Transformer-Based Three-Tline Series Doherty Power Amplifier Achieving 39% PAE
Authors: Zheng Wang, Yifu Li, Yuchao Mei, Xinyu Sui, Qingbin Li, Xu Luo, Rui Wang, Dongxin Ni, Jian Pang
Abstract: This paper presents a transformer-based three- transmission-line (Tline) series Doherty power amplifier (PA) implemented in 65-nm CMOS, targeting broadband K/Ka-band applications. By integrating an impedance-scaling network into the output matching structure, the design enables effective load modulation and reduced impedance transformation ratio (ITR) at power back-off when employing stacked cascode transistors. The PA demonstrates a -3-dB small-signal gain bandwidth from 22 to 32.5 GHz, a saturated output power (Psat) of 21.6 dBm, and a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 39%. At 6dB back-off, the PAE remains above 24%, validating its suitability for high- efficiency mm-wave phased-array transmitters in next-generation wireless systems.

Title: Tight displacement-based formation control under bounded disturbances. A set-theoretic perspective
Authors: Vlad-Matei Angheluţă, Bogdan Gheorghe, Daniel Ioan, Ionela Prodan, Florin Stoican
Abstract: This paper investigates the synthesis of controllers for displacement-based formation control in the presence of bounded disturbances, specifically focusing on uncertainties originating from measurement noise. While the literature frequently addresses such problems using stochastic frameworks, this work proposes a deterministic methodology grounded in set-theoretic concepts. By leveraging the principles of set invariance, we adapt the theory of ultimate boundedness to the specific dynamics of displacement-based formations. This approach provides a rigorous method for analyzing the system's behavior under persistent disturbances. Furthermore, this set-theoretic framework allows for the optimized selection of the proposed control law parameters to guarantee pre-specified performance bounds. The efficacy of the synthesized controller is demonstrated in the challenging application of maintaining tight formations in a multi-obstacles environment.

Title: AI-Enhanced IoT Systems for Predictive Maintenance and Affordability Optimization in Smart Microgrids: A Digital Twin Approach
Authors: Koushik Ahmed Kushal, Florimond Gueniat
Abstract: This study presents an AI enhanced IoT framework for predictive maintenance and affordability optimization in smart microgrids using a Digital Twin modeling approach. The proposed system integrates real time sensor data, machine learning based fault prediction, and cost aware operational analytics to improve reliability and energy efficiency in distributed microgrid environments. By synchronizing physical microgrid components with a virtual Digital Twin, the framework enables early detection of component degradation, dynamic load management, and optimized maintenance scheduling. Experimental evaluations demonstrate improved predictive accuracy, reduced operational downtime, and measurable cost savings compared to baseline microgrid management methods. The findings highlight the potential of Digital Twin driven IoT architectures as a scalable solution for next generation intelligent and affordable energy systems.

Title: Recursive Threshold Median Filter and Autoencoder for Salt-and-Pepper Denoising: SSIM analysis of Images and Entropy Maps
Authors: Petr Boriskov, Kirill Rudkovskii, Andrei Velichko
Abstract: This paper studies the removal of salt-and-pepper noise from images using median filter (MF) and simple three-layer autoencoder (AE) within recursive threshold algorithm. The performance of denoising is assessed with two metrics: the standard Structural Similarity Index SSIMImg of restored and clean images and a newly applied metric SSIMMap - the SSIM of entropy maps of these images computed via 2D Sample Entropy in sliding windows. We shown that SSIMMap is more sensitive to blur and local intensity transitions and complements SSIMImg. Experiments on low- and high-resolution grayscales images demonstrate that recursive threshold MF robustly restores images even under strong noise (50-60 %), whereas simple AE is only capable of restoring images with low levels of noise (<30 %). We propose two scalable schemes: (i) 2MF, which uses two MFs with different window sizes and a final thresholding step, effective for highlighting sharp local details at low resolution; and (ii) MFs-AE, which aggregates features from multiple MFs via an AE and is beneficial for restoring the overall scene structure at higher resolution. Owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency, MF remains preferable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms (edge/IoT), whereas AE underperforms without prior denoising. The results also validate the practical value of SSIMMap for objective blur assessment and denoising parameter tuning.

Title: Deep Unfolded BM3D: Unrolling Non-local Collaborative Filtering into a Trainable Neural Network
Authors: Kerem Basim (1), Mehmet Ozan Unal (1), Metin Ertas (2), Isa Yildirim (1) ((1) Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, (2) Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey)
Abstract: Block-Matching and 3D Filtering (BM3D) exploits non-local self-similarity priors for denoising but relies on fixed parameters. Deep models such as U-Net are more flexible but often lack interpretability and fail to generalize across noise regimes. In this study, we propose Deep Unfolded BM3D (DU-BM3D), a hybrid framework that unrolls BM3D into a trainable architecture by replacing its fixed collaborative filtering with a learnable U-Net denoiser. This preserves BM3D's non-local structural prior while enabling end-to-end optimization. We evaluate DU-BM3D on low-dose CT (LDCT) denoising and show that it outperforms classic BM3D and standalone U-Net across simulated LDCT at different noise levels, yielding higher PSNR and SSIM, especially in high-noise conditions.

Title: Multimodal RGB-HSI Feature Fusion with Patient-Aware Incremental Heuristic Meta-Learning for Oral Lesion Classification
Authors: Rupam Mukherjee, Rajkumar Daniel, Soujanya Hazra, Shirin Dasgupta, Subhamoy Mandal
Abstract: Early detection of oral cancer and potentially malignant disorders is challenging in low-resource settings due to limited annotated data. We present a unified four-class oral lesion classifier that integrates deep RGB embeddings, hyperspectral reconstruction, handcrafted spectral-textural descriptors, and demographic metadata. A pathologist-verified subset of oral cavity images was curated and processed using a fine-tuned ConvNeXt-v2 encoder, followed by RGB-to-HSI reconstruction into 31-band hyperspectral cubes. Haemoglobin-sensitive indices, texture features, and spectral-shape measures were extracted and fused with deep and clinical features. Multiple machine-learning models were assessed with patient-wise validation. We further introduce an incremental heuristic meta-learner (IHML) that combines calibrated base classifiers through probabilistic stacking and patient-level posterior smoothing. On an unseen patient split, the proposed framework achieved a macro F1 of 66.23% and an accuracy of 64.56%. Results demonstrate that hyperspectral reconstruction and uncertainty-aware meta-learning substantially improve robustness for real-world oral lesion screening.

Title: RAA-MIL: A Novel Framework for Classification of Oral Cytology
Authors: Rupam Mukherjee, Rajkumar Daniel, Soujanya Hazra, Shirin Dasgupta, Subhamoy Mandal
Abstract: Cytology is a valuable tool for early detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, manual examination of cytology whole slide images (WSIs) is slow, subjective, and depends heavily on expert pathologists. To address this, we introduce the first weakly supervised deep learning framework for patient-level diagnosis of oral cytology whole slide images, leveraging the newly released Oral Cytology Dataset [1], which provides annotated cytology WSIs from ten medical centres across India. Each patient case is represented as a bag of cytology patches and assigned a diagnosis label (Healthy, Benign, Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD), OSCC) by an in-house expert pathologist. These patient-level weak labels form a new extension to the dataset. We evaluate a baseline multiple-instance learning (MIL) model and a proposed Region-Affinity Attention MIL (RAA-MIL) that models spatial relationships between regions within each slide. The RAA-MIL achieves an average accuracy of 72.7%, weighted F1-score of 0.69 on an unseen test set, outperforming the baseline. This study establishes the first patient-level weakly supervised benchmark for oral cytology and moves toward reliable AI-assisted digital pathology.

Title: DataOps-driven CI/CD for analytics repositories
Authors: Dmytro Valiaiev
Abstract: The proliferation of SQL for data processing has often occurred without the rigor of traditional software development, leading to siloed efforts, logic replication, and increased risk. This ad-hoc approach hampers data governance and makes validation nearly impossible. Organizations are adopting DataOps, a methodology combining Agile, Lean, and DevOps principles to address these challenges to treat analytics pipelines as production systems. However, a standardized framework for implementing DataOps is lacking. This perspective proposes a qualitative design for a DataOps-aligned validation framework. It introduces a DataOps Controls Scorecard, derived from a multivocal literature review, which distills key concepts into twelve testable controls. These controls are then mapped to a modular, extensible CI/CD pipeline framework designed to govern a single source of truth (SOT) SQL repository. The framework consists of five stages: Lint, Optimize, Parse, Validate, and Observe, each containing specific, automated checks. A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) demonstrates how each high-level control is enforced by concrete pipeline checks, ensuring qualitative completeness. This approach provides a structured mechanism for enhancing data quality, governance, and collaboration, allowing teams to scale analytics development with transparency and control.

Abstract: Lexical tone is central to many languages but remains underexplored in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, especially beyond Mandarin. We study four languages with complex and diverse tone systems: Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese, to examine how far such models listen for tone and how transfer operates in low-resource conditions. As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues to be about 100 ms in Burmese and Thai, and about 180 ms in Lao and Vietnamese. Probes and gradient analyses on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias the model toward overly long spans. These findings indicate that tone transfer is shaped by downstream task, highlighting task effects on temporal focus in tone modeling.

Title: A Linear Implementation of an Analog Resonate-and-Fire Neuron
Authors: Angqi Liu, Filippo Moro, Sebastian Billaudelle, Melika Payvand
Abstract: Oscillatory dynamics have recently proven highly effective in machine learning (ML), particularly through State-Space-Models (SSM) that leverage structured linear recurrences for long-range temporal processing. Resonate-and-Fire neurons capture such oscillatory behavior in a spiking framework, offering strong expressivity with sparse event-based communication. While early analog RAF circuits employed nonlinear coupling and suffered from process sensitivity, modern ML practice favors linear recurrence. In this work, we introduce a resonate-and-fire (RAF) neuron, built in 22nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator technology, that aligns with SSM principles while retaining the efficiency of spike-based communication. We analyze its dynamics, linearity, and resilience to Process, Voltage, and Temperature variations, and evaluate its power, performance, and area trade-offs. We map the characteristics of our circuit into a system-level simulation where our RAF neuron is utilized in a keyword-spotting task, showing that its non-idealities do not hinder performance. Our results establish RAF neurons as robust, energy-efficient computational primitives for neuromorphic hardware.

Title: ISAC with Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: An FMCW-Based Signal Processing Perspective
Authors: Jiajun Zhu, Yanqun Tang, Cong Yi, Haoran Yin, Yuanhan Ni, Fan Liu, Zhiqiang Wei, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: This paper investigates the sensing potential of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in high-mobility integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) from the perspective of radar waveforms. We introduce an innovative parameter selection criterion that establishes a precise mathematical equivalence between AFDM subcarriers and Nyquist-sampled frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW). This connection not only provides a clear physical insight into AFDM's sensing mechanism but also enables a direct mapping from the DAFT index to delay-Doppler (DD) parameters of wireless channels. Building on this, we develop a novel input-output model in a DD-parameterized DAFT (DD-DAFT) domain for AFDM, which explicitly reveals the inherent DD coupling effect arising from the chirp-channel interaction. Subsequently, we design two matched-filtering sensing algorithms. The first is performed in the time-frequency domain with low complexity, while the second is operated in the DD-DAFT domain to precisely resolve the DD coupling. Simulations show that our algorithms achieve effective pilot-free sensing and demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between sensing performance, communication overhead, and computational complexity. The proposed AFDM outperforms classical AFDM and other variants in most scenarios.

Title: Target Defense against Sequentially Arriving Intruders: Algorithm for Agents with Dubins Dynamics
Authors: Arman Pourghorban, Dipankar Maity
Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. Both the defender and the intruders have non-holonomic dynamics. The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte-Carlo-type random trials of experiments.

Title: VoiceCraft-X: Unifying Multilingual, Voice-Cloning Speech Synthesis and Speech Editing
Authors: Zhisheng Zheng, Puyuan Peng, Anuj Diwan, Cong Phuoc Huynh, Xiaohang Sun, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat, David Harwath
Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft-X, an autoregressive neural codec language model which unifies multilingual speech editing and zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis across 11 languages: English, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, and Polish. VoiceCraft-X utilizes the Qwen3 large language model for phoneme-free cross-lingual text processing and a novel token reordering mechanism with time-aligned text and speech tokens to handle both tasks as a single sequence generation problem. The model generates high-quality, natural-sounding speech, seamlessly creating new audio or editing existing recordings within one framework. VoiceCraft-X shows robust performance in diverse linguistic settings, even with limited per-language data, underscoring the power of unified autoregressive approaches for advancing complex, real-world multilingual speech applications.

Title: Toward ISAC-empowered subnetworks: Cooperative localization and iterative node selection
Authors: Mostafa Nozari, Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Fabio Saggese, Gilberto Berardinelli
Abstract: This paper tackles the sensing-communication trade-off in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-empowered subnetworks for mono-static target localization. We propose a low-complexity iterative node selection algorithm that exploits the spatial diversity of subnetwork deployments and dynamically refines the set of sensing subnetworks to maximize localization accuracy under tight resource constraints. Simulation results show that our method achieves sub-7 cm accuracy in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels within only three iterations, yielding over 97% improvement compared to the best-performing benchmark under the same sensing budget. We further demonstrate that increasing spatial diversity through additional antennas and subnetworks enhances sensing robustness, especially in fading channels. Finally, we quantify the sensing-communication trade-off, showing that reducing sensing iterations and the number of sensing subnetworks improves throughput at the cost of reduced localization precision.

Title: MTMed3D: A Multi-Task Transformer-Based Model for 3D Medical Imaging
Authors: Fan Li, Arun Iyengar, Lanyu Xu
Abstract: In the field of medical imaging, AI-assisted techniques such as object detection, segmentation, and classification are widely employed to alleviate the workload of physicians and doctors. However, single-task models are predominantly used, overlooking the shared information across tasks. This oversight leads to inefficiencies in real-life applications. In this work, we propose MTMed3D, a novel end-to-end Multi-task Transformer-based model to address the limitations of single-task models by jointly performing 3D detection, segmentation, and classification in medical imaging. Our model uses a Transformer as the shared encoder to generate multi-scale features, followed by CNN-based task-specific decoders. The proposed framework was evaluated on the BraTS 2018 and 2019 datasets, achieving promising results across all three tasks, especially in detection, where our method achieves better results than prior works. Additionally, we compare our multi-task model with equivalent single-task variants trained separately. Our multi-task model significantly reduces computational costs and achieves faster inference speed while maintaining comparable performance to the single-task models, highlighting its efficiency advantage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage Transformers for multi-task learning that simultaneously covers detection, segmentation, and classification tasks in 3D medical imaging, presenting its potential to enhance diagnostic processes.

Title: DER Day-Ahead Offering: A Neural Network Column-and-Constraint Generation Approach
Authors: Weiqi Meng, Hongyi Li, Bai Cui
Abstract: In the day-ahead energy market, the offering strategy of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators must be submitted before the uncertainty realization in the form of price-quantity pairs. This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage robust adaptive stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions and is up to 100 times faster than Gurobi and 33 times faster than classical column-and-constraint generation on the same 1028-node synthetic distribution network.

Title: DEMIST: \underline{DE}coupled \underline{M}ulti-stream latent d\underline{I}ffusion for Quantitative Myelin Map \underline{S}yn\underline{T}hesis
Authors: Jiacheng Wang, Hao Li, Xing Yao, Ahmad Toubasi, Taegan Vinarsky, Caroline Gheen, Joy Derwenskus, Chaoyang Jin, Richard Dortch, Junzhong Xu, Francesca Bagnato, Ipek Oguz
Abstract: Quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging provides myelin-sensitive biomarkers, such as the pool size ratio (PSR), which is valuable for multiple sclerosis (MS) assessment. However, qMT requires specialized 20-30 minute scans. We propose DEMIST to synthesize PSR maps from standard T1w and FLAIR images using a 3D latent diffusion model with three complementary conditioning mechanisms. Our approach has two stages: first, we train separate autoencoders for PSR and anatomical images to learn aligned latent representations. Second, we train a conditional diffusion model in this latent space on top of a frozen diffusion foundation backbone. Conditioning is decoupled into: (i) \textbf{semantic} tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \textbf{spatial} per-scale residual hints via a 3D ControlNet branch, and (iii) \textbf{adaptive} LoRA-modulated attention. We include edge-aware loss terms to preserve lesion boundaries and alignment losses to maintain quantitative consistency, while keeping the number of trainable parameters low and retaining the inductive bias of the pretrained model. We evaluate on 163 scans from 99 subjects using 5-fold cross-validation. Our method outperforms VAE, GAN and diffusion baselines on multiple metrics, producing sharper boundaries and better quantitative agreement with ground truth. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Online Adaptive Probabilistic Safety Certificate with Language Guidance
Authors: Zhuoyuan Wang, Xiyu Deng, Hikaru Hoshino, Yorie Nakahira
Abstract: Achieving long-term safety in uncertain or extreme environments while accounting for human preferences remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Existing methods often trade off long-term guarantees for fast real-time control and cannot adapt to variability in human preferences or risk tolerance. To address these limitations, we propose a language-guided adaptive probabilistic safety certificate (PSC) framework that guarantees long-term safety for stochastic systems under environmental uncertainty while accommodating diverse human preferences. The proposed framework integrates natural-language inputs from users and Bayesian estimators of the environment into adaptive safety certificates that explicitly account for user preferences, system dynamics, and quantified uncertainties. Our key technical innovation leverages probabilistic invariance--a generalization of forward invariance to a probability space--to obtain myopic safety conditions with long-term safety guarantees that integrate language guidance, model information, and quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical simulations of autonomous lane-keeping with human-in-the-loop guidance under uncertain and extreme road conditions, demonstrating enhanced safety-performance trade-offs, adaptability to changing environments, and personalization to different user preferences.

Title: A Multicollinearity-Aware Signal-Processing Framework for Cross-$β$ Identification via X-ray Scattering of Alzheimer's Tissue
Authors: Abdullah Al Bashit, Prakash Nepal, Lee Makowski
Abstract: X-ray scattering measurements of in situ human brain tissue encode structural signatures of pathological cross-$\beta$ inclusions, yet systematic exploitation of these data for automated detection remains challenging due to substrate contamination, strong inter-feature correlations, and limited sample sizes. This work develops a three-stage classification framework for identifying cross-$\beta$ structural inclusions-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease-in X-ray scattering profiles of post-mortem human brain. Stage 1 employs a Bayes-optimal classifier to separate mica substrate from tissue regions on the basis of their distinct scattering signatures. Stage 2 introduces a multicollinearityaware, class-conditional correlation pruning scheme with formal guarantees on the induced Bayes risk and approximation error, thereby reducing redundancy while retaining class-discriminative information. Stage 3 trains a compact neural network on the pruned feature set to detect the presence or absence of cross-$\beta$ fibrillar ordering. The top-performing model, optimized with a composite loss combining Focal and Dice objectives, attains a test F1-score of 84.30% using 11 of 211 candidate features and 174 trainable parameters. The overall framework yields an interpretable, theory-grounded strategy for data-limited classification problems involving correlated, high-dimensional experimental measurements, exemplified here by X-ray scattering profiles of neurodegenerative tissue.

Title: Cross-Layer Design for Near-Field mmWave Beam Management and Scheduling under Delay-Sensitive Traffic
Authors: Zijun Wang, Anjali Omer, Jacob Chakareski, Nicholas Mastronarde, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks will rely on mmWave/sub-THz spectrum and extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs). This will push their operation into the near field where far-field beam management degrades and beam training becomes more costly and must be done more frequently. Because ELAA training and data transmission consume energy and training trades off with service time, we pose a cross-layer control problem that couples PHY-layer beam management with MAC-layer service under delay-sensitive traffic. The controller decides when to retrain and how aggressively to train (pilot count and sparsity) while allocating transmit power, explicitly balancing pilot overhead, data-phase rate, and energy to reduce the queueing delay of MAC-layer frames/packets to be transmitted. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and solve it with deep reinforcement learning. In simulations with a realistic near-field channel and varying mobility and traffic load, the learned policy outperforms strong 5G-NR--style baselines at a comparable energy: it achieves 85.5% higher throughput than DFT sweeping and reduces the overflow rate by 78%. These results indicate a practical path to overhead-aware, traffic-adaptive near-field beam management with implications for emerging low-latency, high-rate next-generation applications such as digital twin, spatial computing, and immersive communication.

Title: Lightweight Deep Autoencoder for ECG Denoising with Morphology Preservation and Near Real-Time Hardware Deployment
Authors: Mahdi Pirayesh Shirazi Nejad, David Hicks, Matt Valentine, Ki H. Chon
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are often degraded by various noise sources such as baseline wander, motion artifacts, and electromyographic interference, posing a major challenge in clinical settings. This paper presents a lightweight deep learning-based denoising framework, forming a compact autoencoder architecture. The model was trained under severe noise conditions (-5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) using a rigorously partitioned dataset to ensure no data leakage and robust generalization. Extensive evaluations were conducted across seven noise configurations and three SNR levels (-5 dB, 0 dB, and +5 dB), showing consistent denoising performance with minimal morphological distortion, critical for maintaining diagnostic integrity. In particular, tests on clinically vital rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) confirm that the proposed model effectively suppresses noise without altering arrhythmic features essential for diagnosis. Visual and quantitative assessments, including SNR improvement, RMSE, and correlation metrics, validate the model's efficacy in preserving waveform fidelity. To demonstrate real-world applicability, the model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 using TensorFlow Lite with float16 precision. Inference latency was measured at just 1.41 seconds per 14-second ECG segment, indicating feasibility for near-real-time use in edge devices. Overall, this study introduces a lightweight, hardware-validated, and morphologically reliable ECG denoising solution suitable for integration into portable or wearable healthcare systems.

Title: One Request, Multiple Experts: LLM Orchestrates Domain Specific Models via Adaptive Task Routing
Authors: Xu Yang, Chenhui Lin, Haotian Liu, Qi Wang, Yue Yang, Wenchuan Wu
Abstract: With the integration of massive distributed energy resources and the widespread participation of novel market entities, the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs) is progressively evolving into a complex multi-scenario, multi-objective problem. Although expert engineers have developed numerous domain specific models (DSMs) to address distinct technical problems, mastering, integrating, and orchestrating these heterogeneous DSMs still entail considerable overhead for ADN operators. Therefore, an intelligent approach is urgently required to unify these DSMs and enable efficient coordination. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the ADN-Agent architecture, which leverages a general large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple DSMs, enabling adaptive intent recognition, task decomposition, and DSM invocation. Within the ADN-Agent, we design a novel communication mechanism that provides a unified and flexible interface for diverse heterogeneous DSMs. Finally, for some language-intensive subtasks, we propose an automated training pipeline for fine-tuning small language models, thereby effectively enhancing the overall problem-solving capability of the system. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method and demonstrate that the ADN-Agent architecture outperforms existing LLM application paradigms.

Title: Density-Driven Multi-Agent Coordination for Efficient Farm Coverage and Management in Smart Agriculture
Authors: Sungjun Seo, Kooktae Lee
Abstract: The growing scale of modern farms has increased the need for efficient and adaptive multi-agent coverage strategies for pest, weed, and disease management. Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture.

Title: Robust Radar HRRP Recognition under Non-uniform Jamming Based on Complex-valued Frequency Attention Network
Authors: Yanhao Wang, Lei Wang, Jie Wang, Yimin Liu
Abstract: Complex electromagnetic environments, often containing multiple jammers with different jamming patterns, produce non-uniform jamming power across the frequency spectrum. This spectral non-uniformity directly induces severe distortion in the target's HRRP, consequently compromising the performance and reliability of conventional HRRP-based target recognition methods. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end trained network for robust radar target recognition. The core of our model is a CFA module that operates directly on the complex spectrum of the received echo. The CFA module learns to generate an adaptive frequency-domain filter, assigning lower weights to bands corrupted by strong jamming while preserving critical target information in cleaner bands. The filtered spectrum is then fed into a classifier backbone for recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data with various jamming combinations demonstrate our method's superiority. Notably, under severe jamming conditions, our model achieves a recognition accuracy nearly 9% higher than traditional model-based approaches, all while introducing negligible computational overhead. This highlights its exceptional performance and robustness in challenging jamming environments.

Title: A mixed-signal analogue front-end for brain-implantable neural interfaces using a digital fixed-point IIR filter and bulk offset cancellation
Authors: Dimitris Antoniadis, Timothy G. Constandinou
Abstract: Advances in miniaturised implantable neural electronics have paved the way for therapeutic brain-computer interfaces with clinical potential for movement disorders, epilepsy, and broader neurological applications. This paper presents a mixed-signal analogue front end (AFE) designed to record both extracellular action potentials (EAPs) and local field potentials (LFPs). The feedforward path integrates a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a successive-approximation-register (SAR) analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), while the feedback path employs a fixed-point infinite-impulse-response (IIR) Chebyshev Type II low-pass filter to suppress sub-mHz components via bulk-voltage control of the LNA input differential pair using two R-2R pseudo-resistor digital-to-analogue converters (DACs). The proposed AFE achieves up to 41.42dB gain, consumes 2.178uA per channel, occupies 0.198mm2 per channel, and supports neural signal monitoring from 0.1Hz to 10kHz with 3.59uVrms input-referred integrated noise.

Title: Eardrum sound pressure prediction from ear canal reflectance based on the inverse solution of Webster's horn equation
Authors: Reinhild Roden, Tobias Sankowsky-Rothe, Nick Wulbusch, Alexey Chernov, Matthias Blau
Abstract: To derive ear canal transfer functions for individualized equalization algorithms of in-ear hearing systems, individual ear canal models are needed. In a one-dimensional approach, this requires the estimation of the individual area function of the ear canal. The area function can be effectively and reproducibly calculated as the inverse solution of Webster's horn equation by finite difference approximation of the time domain reflectance. Building upon previous research, the present study further investigates the termination of the approximation at an optimal spatial resolution, addressing the absence of higher frequencies in typical ear canal measurements and enhancing the accuracy of the inverse solution. Compared to the geometric reference, more precise area functions were achieved by extrapolating simulated input impedances of ear canal geometries up to a frequency of 3.5 MHz, corresponding to 0.1 mm spatial resolution. The low pass of the previous work was adopted but adjusted for its cut-off frequency depending on the highest frequency of the band-limited input impedance. Robust criteria for terminating the area function at the approximated ear canal length were found. Finally, three-dimensional simulated and measured ear canal transfer impedances were replicated well employing the previously introduced and herein validated one-dimensional electro-acoustic model fed by the area functions.

Title: On hyperexponential stabilization of a chain of integrators in continuous and discrete time subject to unmatched perturbations
Authors: Moussa Labbadi, Denis Efimov
Abstract: A recursive time-varying state feedback is presented for a chain of integrators with unmatched perturbations in continuous and discrete time. In continuous time, it is shown that hyperexponential convergence is achieved for the first state variable \(x_1\), while the second state \(x_2\) remains bounded. For the other states, we establish ISS {\cb property} by saturating the growing {\cb control} gain. In discrete time, we use implicit Euler discretization to {\cb preserve} hyperexponential convergence. The main results are demonstrated through several examples of the proposed control laws, illustrating the conditions established for both continuous and discrete-time systems.

Title: On two-degrees-of-freedom agreement protocols
Authors: Gal Barkai, Leonid Mirkin, Daniel Zelazo
Abstract: We propose a distributed two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) architecture for driving autonomous, possibly heterogeneous, agents to agreement. The scheme mirrors classical servo structures, separating local feedback from network filtering. This separation enables independent network-filter design for prescribed noise attenuation and allows controller heterogeneity to reject local disturbances, including disturbances exciting unstable agreement poles -- which is known to be impossible via standard diffusive couplings. The potential of the framework is illustrated via two numerical examples.

Title: Visibility-aware Satellite Selection and Resource Allocation in Multi-Orbit LEO Networks
Authors: Yingzhuo Sun, Yulan Gao, Ming Xiao, Zhu Han, Octavia A. Dobre
Abstract: Multi orbit low earth orbit (LEO) satellites communication is envisioned as a key infrastructure to deliver global coverage, enabling future services from space air ground integrated this http URL, the optimized design of LEO which jointly addresses satellite selection, association control, and resource scheduling while accounting for dynamic visibility in multi orbit constellations still remains open. Satellites moving along distinct orbital planes yield phase shifted ground tracks and heterogeneous, time varying coverage patterns that significantly complicate the this http URL bridge the gap, we propose a dynamic visibility aware multi orbit satellite selection framework which can determine the optimal serving satellites across orbital layers. The framework is built upon Markov approximation and matching game theory. Specifically, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that maximizes the sum rate under per satellite power budgets. The problem is NP hard , combining discrete user association (UA) decisions with continuous power allocation, and an inherently non convex sum rate maximization objective. We address it through a problem specific Markov approximation. Moreover, we alternately solve UA or bandwidth allocation via a matching game and power allocation via a Lagrangian dual program, which together form a block coordinate descent method tailored to this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges to a suboptimal solution across all scenarios. Extensive experiments against four state of the art baselines further demonstrate that our algorithm achieves, on average, approximately 7.85% higher sum rate than the best performing baseline.

Title: Diffusion Algorithm for Metalens Optical Aberration Correction
Authors: Harshana Weligampola, Yuanrui Chen, Abhiram Gnanasambandam, Weiheng Tang, Dilshan Godaliyadda, Hamid R. Sheikh, Qi Guo, Stanley H. Chan
Abstract: Metalenses offer a path toward creating ultra-thin optical systems, but they inherently suffer from severe, spatially varying optical aberrations, especially chromatic aberration, which makes image reconstruction a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel algorithmic solution to this problem, designed to reconstruct a sharp, full-color image from two inputs: a sharp, bandpass-filtered grayscale ``structure image'' and a heavily distorted ``color cue'' image, both captured by the metalens system. Our method utilizes a dual-branch diffusion model, built upon a pre-trained Stable Diffusion XL framework, to fuse information from the two inputs. We demonstrate through quantitative and qualitative comparisons that our approach significantly outperforms existing deblurring and pansharpening methods, effectively restoring high-frequency details while accurately colorizing the image.

Title: Improving the Generalisation of Learned Reconstruction Frameworks
Authors: Emilien Valat, Ozan Öktem
Abstract: Ensuring proper generalization is a critical challenge in applying data-driven methods for solving inverse problems in imaging, as neural networks reconstructing an image must perform well across varied datasets and acquisition geometries. In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to filter the projection data but are ill-suited for this task as they apply grid-based convolutions to the sinogram, which inherently lies on a line manifold, not a regular grid. The CNNs, unaware of the geometry, are implicitly tied to it and require an excessive amount of parameters as they must infer the relations between measurements from the data rather than from prior information. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a graph data structure to represent CT acquisition geometries and tomographic data, providing a detailed explanation of the graph's structure for circular, cone-beam geometries. Second, we propose GLM, a hybrid neural network architecture that leverages both graph and grid convolutions to process tomographic data. We demonstrate that GLM outperforms CNNs when performance is quantified in terms of structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio, despite the fact that GLM uses only a fraction of the trainable parameters. Compared to CNNs, GLM also requires significantly less training time and memory, and its memory requirements scale better. Crucially, GLM demonstrates robust generalization to unseen variations in the acquisition geometry, like when training only on fully sampled CT data and then testing on sparse-view CT data.

Title: Near Field Tapering with Slepian Window: Balancing the Range Angle Sidelobe Trade off
Authors: Ahmed Hussain, Ahmed Sultan, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil
Abstract: Near-field beamforming enables target discrimination in both range (axial) and angle (lateral) dimensions. Elevated sidelobes along either dimension, however, increase susceptibility to interference and degrade detection performance. Conventional amplitude tapering techniques, designed for far-field scenarios, cannot simultaneously suppress axial and lateral sidelobes in near-field. In this letter, we propose a Slepian-based amplitude tapering approach that maximizes mainlobe energy concentration, achieving significant sidelobe reduction in both dimensions. Numerical results show that the proposed taper improves peak sidelobe suppression by approximately 24 dB in the lateral domain and 10 dB in the axial domain compared to a conventional uniform window.

Title: Uniform Circular Arrays in Near-Field: Omnidirectional Coverage with Limited Capacity
Authors: Ahmed Hussain, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that uniform circular arrays (UCAs) can extend the angular coverage of the radiative near field region. This work investigates whether such enhanced angular coverage translates into improved spatial multiplexing performance when compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs). To more accurately delineate the effective near field region, we introduce the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), an angle dependent metric that bounds the spatial region where beamfocusing remains effective. Closed form expressions for both beamdepth and EBRD are derived for UCAs. Our analysis shows that, under a fixed antenna element count, ULAs achieve narrower beamdepth and a longer EBRD than UCAs. Conversely, under a fixed aperture length, UCAs provide slightly narrower beamdepth and a marginally longer EBRD. Simulation results further confirm that ULAs achieve higher sum rate under the fixed element constraint, while UCAs offer marginal performance gain under the fixed aperture constraint.

Title: Density-Driven Optimal Control for Non-Uniform Area Coverage in Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems Using Optimal Transport
Authors: Sungjun Seo, Kooktae Lee
Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental problem of non-uniform area coverage in multi-agent systems, where different regions require varying levels of attention due to mission-dependent priorities. Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability.

Title: On Boundedness of Quadratic Dynamics with Energy-Preserving Nonlinearity
Authors: Shih-Chi Liao, Maziar S. Hemati, Peter Seiler
Abstract: Boundedness is an important property of many physical systems. This includes incompressible fluid flows, which are often modeled by quadratic dynamics with an energy-preserving nonlinearity. For such systems, Schlegel and Noack proposed a sufficient condition for boundedness utilizing quadratic Lyapunov functions. They also propose a necessary condition for boundedness aiming to provide a more complete characterization of boundedness in this class of models. The sufficient condition is based on Lyapunov theory and is true. Our paper focuses on this necessary condition. We use an independent proof to show that the condition is true for two dimensional systems. However, we provide a three dimensional counterexample to illustrate that the necessary condition fails to hold in higher dimensions. Our results highlight a theoretical gap in boundedness analysis and suggest future directions to address the conservatism.

Title: Discrete-Time Stability Analysis of ReLU Feedback Systems via Integral Quadratic Constraints
Authors: Sahel Vahedi Noori, Bin Hu, Geir Dullerud, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper analyzes internal stability of a discrete-time feedback system with a ReLU nonlinearity. This feedback system is motivated by recurrent neural networks. We first review existing static quadratic constraints (QCs) for slope-restricted nonlinearities. Next, we derive hard integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) for scalar ReLU by using finite impulse filters and structured matrices. These IQCs are combined with a dissipation inequality leading to an LMI condition that certifies internal stability. We show that our new dynamic IQCs for ReLU are a superset of the well-known Zames-Falb IQCs specified for slope-restricted nonlinearities. Numerical results show that the proposed hard IQCs give less conservative stability margins than Zames-Falb multipliers and prior static QC methods, sometimes dramatically so.

Title: BrainNormalizer: Anatomy-Informed Pseudo-Healthy Brain Reconstruction from Tumor MRI via Edge-Guided ControlNet
Authors: Min Gu Kwak, Yeonju Lee, Hairong Wang, Jing Li
Abstract: Brain tumors are among the most clinically significant neurological diseases and remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to their aggressive growth and structural heterogeneity. As tumors expand, they induce substantial anatomical deformation that disrupts both local tissue organization and global brain architecture, complicating diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. Yet a subject-specific reference of how the brain would appear without tumor-induced changes is fundamentally unobtainable in clinical practice. We present BrainNormalizer, an anatomy-informed diffusion framework that reconstructs pseudo-healthy MRIs directly from tumorous scans by conditioning the generative process on boundary cues extracted from the subject's own anatomy. This boundary-guided conditioning enables anatomically plausible pseudo-healthy reconstruction without requiring paired non-tumorous and tumorous scans. BrainNormalizer employs a two-stage training strategy. The pretrained diffusion model is first adapted through inpainting-based fine-tuning on tumorous and non-tumorous scans. Next, an edge-map-guided ControlNet branch is trained to inject fine-grained anatomical contours into the frozen decoder while preserving learned priors. During inference, a deliberate misalignment strategy pairs tumorous inputs with non-tumorous prompts and mirrored contralateral edge maps, leveraging hemispheric correspondence to guide reconstruction. On the BraTS2020 dataset, BrainNormalizer achieves strong quantitative performance and qualitatively produces anatomically plausible reconstructions in tumor-affected regions while retaining overall structural coherence. BrainNormalizer provides clinically reliable anatomical references for treatment planning and supports new research directions in counterfactual modeling and tumor-induced deformation analysis.

Title: Green Emergency Communications in RIS- and MA-Assisted Multi-UAV SAGINs: A Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Liangshun Wu, Wen Chen, Shunqing Zhang, Yajun Wang, Kunlun Wang
Abstract: In post-disaster space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), terrestrial infrastructure is often impaired, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rapidly restore connectivity for mission-critical ground terminals in cluttered non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban environments. To enhance coverage, UAVs employ movable antennas (MAs), while reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on surviving high-rises redirect signals. The key challenge is communication-limited partial observability, leaving each UAV with a narrow, fast-changing neighborhood view that destabilizes value estimation. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are inadequate--non-communication methods rely on unavailable global critics, heuristic sharing is brittle and redundant, and learnable protocols (e.g., CommNet, DIAL) lose per-neighbor structure and aggravate non-stationarity under tight bandwidth. To address partial observability, we propose a spatiotemporal A2C where each UAV transmits prior-decision messages with local state, a compact policy fingerprint, and a recurrent belief, encoded per neighbor and concatenated. A spatial discount shapes value targets to emphasize local interactions, while analysis under one-hop-per-slot latency explains stable training with delayed views. Experimental results show our policy outperforms IA2C, ConseNet, FPrint, DIAL, and CommNet--achieving faster convergence, higher asymptotic reward, reduced Temporal-Difference(TD)/advantage errors, and a better communication throughput-energy trade-off.

Title: Wide-Area Feedback Control for Renewables-Heavy Power Systems: A Comparative Study of Reinforcement Learning and Lyapunov-Based Design
Authors: Muhammad Nadeem, MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, accurately modeling power grid dynamics is becoming increasingly more complex. Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids.

Title: cryoSENSE: Compressive Sensing Enables High-throughput Microscopy with Sparse and Generative Priors on the Protein Cryo-EM Image Manifold
Authors: Zain Shabeeb, Daniel Saeedi, Darin Tsui, Vida Jamali, Amirali Aghazadeh
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the atomic-resolution visualization of biomolecules; however, modern direct detectors generate data volumes that far exceed the available storage and transfer bandwidth, thereby constraining practical throughput. We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.

Title: Inertia-Informed Orientation Priors for Event-Based Optical Flow Estimation
Authors: Pritam P. Karmokar, William J. Beksi
Abstract: Event cameras, by virtue of their working principle, directly encode motion within a scene. Many learning-based and model-based methods exist that estimate event-based optical flow, however the temporally dense yet spatially sparse nature of events poses significant challenges. To address these issues, contrast maximization (CM) is a prominent model-based optimization methodology that estimates the motion trajectories of events within an event volume by optimally warping them. Since its introduction, the CM framework has undergone a series of refinements by the computer vision community. Nonetheless, it remains a highly non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biologically-inspired hybrid CM method for event-based optical flow estimation that couples visual and inertial motion cues. Concretely, we propose the use of orientation maps, derived from camera 3D velocities, as priors to guide the CM process. The orientation maps provide directional guidance and constrain the space of estimated motion trajectories. We show that this orientation-guided formulation leads to improved robustness and convergence in event-based optical flow estimation. The evaluation of our approach on the MVSEC, DSEC, and ECD datasets yields superior accuracy scores over the state of the art.

Title: Cooperative ISAC for LAE: Joint Trajectory Planning, Power allocation, and Dynamic Time Division
Authors: Fangzhi Li, Zhichu Ren, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Jing Jin, Qixing Wang, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: To enhance the performance of aerial-ground networks, this paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for multi-UAV systems. In our model, ground base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and employ a time-division strategy in which beam scanning for sensing comes before data communication in each time slot. To maximize the sum communication rate while satisfying the total sensing mutual information (MI) requirement, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectories, communication and sensing power allocation, and the dynamic time-division ratio. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved using an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint design significantly outperforms benchmark schemes with static or partially optimized resources. The findings also reveal the critical importance of dynamic trajectory and resource management for effectively navigating the sensing-communication trade-off, especially under stringent power or sensing constraints.

Title: An Online Multiobjective Policy Gradient for Long-run Average-reward Markov Decision Process
Authors: Rahul Misra, Manuela L. Bujorianu, Rafał Wisniewski
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for multi-objective decision-making, where the agent seeks to optimize a vector of rewards rather than a single scalar value. The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example.

Authors: Reiner Thomä, Michael Döbereiner, Reza Faramarzahangari, Jonas Gedschold. Marc Francisco Colaco Miranda, Saw James Myint, Steffen Schieler, Christian Schneider, Sebastian Semper, Carsten Smeenk, Gerd Sommerkorn, Zhixiang Zhao
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) will become a service in future mobile communication networks. It enables the detection and recognition of passive objects and environments using radar-like sensing. The ultimate advantage is the reuse of the mobile network and radio access resources for scene illumination, sensing, data transportation, computation, and fusion. It enables building a distributed, ubiquitous sensing network that can be adapted for a variety of radio sensing tasks and services. In this article, we develop the principles of multi-sensor ISAC (MS-ISAC). MS-ISAC corresponds to multi-user MIMO communication, which in radar terminology is known as distributed MIMO radar. \ First, we develop basic architectural principles for MS-ISAC and link them to example use cases. We then propose a generic MS-ISAC architecture. After a brief reference to multipath propagation and multistatic target reflectivity issues, we outline multilink access, coordination, precoding and link adaptation schemes for MS-ISAC. Moreover, we review model-based estimation and tracking of delay~/~Doppler from sparse OFDMA~/~TDMA frames. We emphasize Cooperative Passive Coherent Location (CPCL) for bistatic correlation and synchronization. Finally, issues of multisensor node synchronization and distributed data fusion are addressed.

Title: Initial Excitation-based Adaptive Observers for Discrete-Time LTI Systems
Authors: Anchita Dey, Soutrik Bandyopadhyay, Shubhendu Bhasin
Abstract: In practical applications, the efficacy of a control algorithm relies critically on the accurate knowledge of the parameters and states of the underlying system. However, obtaining these quantities in practice is often challenging. Adaptive observers address this issue by performing simultaneous state and parameter estimation using only input-output measurements. While many adaptive observer designs exist for continuous-time systems, their discrete-time counterparts remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes an initial excitation (IE)-based adaptive observer for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. In contrast to conventional designs that rely on the persistence of excitation condition, which requires continuous excitation and infinite control effort, the proposed method does not require excitation for infinite time, thus making it more practical for stabilization tasks. We employ a two-layer filtering structure and a normalized gradient descent-based update law for learning the unknown parameters. We also propose modifying the regressors to enhance information extraction, leading to faster convergence. Rigorous theoretical analysis guarantees bounded and exponentially converging estimates of both states and parameters under the IE condition, and simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed design.

Title: Carbon Reduction Potential and Sensitivity Analysis of Rural Integrated Energy System with Carbon Trading and Coordinated Electric-Thermal Demand Response
Authors: Xuxin Yang, Xue Yuan, Donghan Feng, Siru Chen, Yuanhao Feng
Abstract: Constructing clean and low-carbon rural integrated energy system (RIES) is a fundamental requirement for supporting China's rural modernization and new-type urbanization. Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES.

Title: A Comprehensive Review of Advancements in Powering and Charging Systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Harsh Abhinandan, Aditya Dhanraj, Aryan Katoch, R. Raja Singh
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones have witnessed a spectacular surge in applications for military, commercial, and civilian purposes. However, their potential for flight is always limited by the finite power budget of their onboard power supplies. The limited flight time problem has led to intensive research into new sources of power and innovative charging strategies to enable protracted, autonomous flight. This paper gives a comparative summary of the current state-of-the-art in UAV power and refuelling technology. The paper begins with an analysis of the variety of energy sources, from classical batteries to fuel cells and hybrid systems, based on their relative advantages and disadvantages in energy density, weight, and safety. Subsequently, the review explores a spectrum of replenishment options, from simple manual battery swapping to sophisticated high-tech automatic docking stations and smart contact-based charging pads. Most of the review is dedicated to the newer technology of wireless power transfer, which involves near-field (inductive, capacitive) and far-field (laser, microwave) technology. The article also delves into the most important power electronic converter topologies, battery management systems, and control approaches that form the core of these charging systems. Finally, it recapitulates the most significant challenges in technical, economic, and social aspects for promising avenues of future research. The comprehensive review is a valuable guide for researchers, engineers, and policymakers striving to enhance UAV operational performance.

Title: Cyber-Resilient Fault Diagnosis Methodology in Inverter-Based Resource-Dominated Microgrids with Single-Point Measurement
Authors: Yifan Wang, Yiyao Yu, Yang Xia, Yan Xu
Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of inverter-based resource-dominated microgrids (IBR-dominated microgrids). At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modeling assumptions that are untenable under single-point measurement constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves timely fault localization and cyber-resilient fault diagnosis using only one VPQ (voltage, active power, reactive power) measurement point. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritize the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter IBR-dominated microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6% (bias), 94.0% (noise), 92.8% (data replacement), and 95.7% (replay), while sustaining 96.7% under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of IBR-dominated microgrids.

Title: Autonomous Sensing UAV for Accurate Multi-User Identification and Localization in Cellular Networks
Authors: Niccolò Paglierani, Francesco Linsalata, Vineeth Teeda, Davide Scazzoli, Maurizio Magarini
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous sensing frame- work for identifying and localizing multiple users in Fifth Generation (5G) networks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is not part of the serving access network. Unlike conventional aerial serving nodes, the proposed UAV operates passively and is dedicated solely to sensing. It captures Uplink (UL) Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), and requires virtually no coordination with the network infrastructure. A complete signal processing chain is proposed and developed, encompassing synchronization, user identification, and localization, all executed onboard UAV during flight. The system autonomously plans and adapts its mission workflow to estimate multiple user positions within a single deployment, integrating flight control with real-time sensing. Extensive simulations and a full-scale low- altitude experimental campaign validate the approach, showing localization errors below 3 m in rural field tests and below 8 m in urban simulation scenarios, while reliably identifying each user. The results confirm the feasibility of infrastructure-independent sensing UAVs as a core element of the emerging Low Altitude Economy (LAE), supporting situational awareness and rapid deployment in emergency or connectivity-limited environments.

Title: Event-Triggered Regulation of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Under Varying Traffic Conditions
Authors: Yihuai Zhang, Huan Yu
Abstract: Modeling and congestion mitigation of mixed-autonomy traffic systems consisting of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become increasingly critical with the rapid development of autonomous driving technology. This paper develops an event-triggered control (ETC) framework for mitigating congestion in such systems, which are modeled using an extended Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) formulation consisting of coupled 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Ramp metering is employed as the boundary actuation mechanism. To reduce computational and communication burdens while avoiding excessive ramp signal changes, we design the ETC strategy based on the backstepping method, together with an observer-based ETC formulation for practical implementation under limited sensing. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis ensures exponential convergence and avoidance of Zeno behavior. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach under diverse traffic scenarios, including varying AV penetration rates, different spacing policies, multiple demand levels, and non-recurrent congestion patterns. Results show that ETC not only stabilizes mixed traffic flows but also significantly reduces control updates, improving driver comfort, and roadway safety. Higher AV penetration rates lead to longer release time and fewer triggering events, indicating the positive impact of AVs in mitigating traffic congestion while reducing computational resource usage. Compared to continuous backstepping controllers, the proposed ETC achieves near-equivalent stabilization performance with far fewer controller updates, resulting in longer signal release time that reduces driver distraction, which demonstrates great potential for ETC applications in traffic management.

Title: Robust Control Design Using a Hybrid-Gain Finite-Time Sliding-Mode Controller
Authors: Amit Shivam, Kiran Kumari, Fernando A.C.C. Fontes
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid-gain finite-time sliding-mode control (HG-FTSMC) strategy for a class of perturbed nonlinear systems. The controller combines a finite-time reaching law that drives the sliding variable to a predefined boundary layer with an inner mixed-power or exponential law that guarantees rapid convergence within the layer while maintaining smooth and bounded control action. The resulting control design achieves finite-time convergence and robustness to matched disturbances, while explicitly limits the control effort. The control framework is first analyzed on a perturbed first-order integrator model, and then extended to Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems, representing a broad class of robotic and mechanical systems. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves settling times comparable to recent finite-time approaches [1], while substantially reducing the control effort. Finally, trajectory-tracking simulations on a two-link manipulator further validate the robustness and practical feasibility of the proposed HG-FTSMC approach.

Title: Pinching-Antenna-Enabled Cognitive Radio Networks
Authors: Zeyang Sun, Xidong Mu, Shuai Han, Sai Xu, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper investigates a pinching-antenna (PA)-enabled cognitive radio network, where both the primary transmitter (PT) and secondary transmitter (ST) are equipped with a single waveguide and multiple PAs to facilitate simultaneous spectrum sharing. Under a general Ricean fading channel model, a closed-form analytical expression for the average spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by PAs is first derived. Based on this, a sum-SE maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the primary and secondary pinching beamforming, subject to system constraints on the transmission power budgets, minimum antenna separation requirements, and feasible PA deployment regions. To address this non-convex problem, a three-stage optimization algorithm is developed to sequentially optimize both the PT and ST pinching beamforming, and the ST power control. For the PT and ST pinching beamforming optimization, the coarse positions of PA are first determined at the waveguide-level. Then, wavelength-level refinements achieve constructive signal combination at the intended user and destructive superposition at the unintended user. For the ST power control, a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that i) PAs can achieve significant SE improvements over conventional fixed-position antennas; ii) the proposed pinching beamforming design achieves effective interference suppression and superior performance for both even and odd numbers of PAs; and iii) the developed three-stage optimization algorithm enables nearly orthogonal transmission between the primary and secondary networks.

Title: Beyond Energy Functions and Numerical Integration: A New Methodology to Determine Transient Stability at the Initial State
Authors: Wenhao Wu, Dan Wu, Bin Wang, Jiabing Hu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for transient stability analysis (TSA) that circumvents the limitations of sequential numerical integration and energy functions. The proposed method begins by constructing a trajectory-dependent stability indicator function to distinguish the system's destiny. To overcome the difficulty in analyzing the asymptotic behavior at infinite time, a strategic time contraction mapping is then applied. This allows TSA to be recast as a pole-placement detection problem for the indicator function. By leveraging high-order derivatives at the initial state, a rational function approximation is derived, yielding a mathematically direct and computationally efficient prediction. Numerical validations on benchmark systems demonstrate that the method not only provides a direct mathematical shortcut for TSA in power systems but also establishes a promising new methodology for evaluating the transient stability of a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Title: PASE: Leveraging the Phonological Prior of WavLM for Low-Hallucination Generative Speech Enhancement
Authors: Xiaobin Rong, Qinwen Hu, Mansur Yesilbursa, Kamil Wojcicki, Jing Lu
Abstract: Generative models have shown remarkable performance in speech enhancement (SE), achieving superior perceptual quality over traditional discriminative approaches. However, existing generative SE approaches often overlook the risk of hallucination under severe noise, leading to incorrect spoken content or inconsistent speaker characteristics, which we term linguistic and acoustic hallucinations, respectively. We argue that linguistic hallucination stems from models' failure to constrain valid phonological structures and it is a more fundamental challenge. While language models (LMs) are well-suited for capturing the underlying speech structure through modeling the distribution of discrete tokens, existing approaches are limited in learning from noise-corrupted representations, which can lead to contaminated priors and hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Phonologically Anchored Speech Enhancer (PASE), a generative SE framework that leverages the robust phonological prior embedded in the pre-trained WavLM model to mitigate hallucinations. First, we adapt WavLM into a denoising expert via representation distillation to clean its final-layer features. Guided by the model's intrinsic phonological prior, this process enables robust denoising while minimizing linguistic hallucinations. To further reduce acoustic hallucinations, we train the vocoder with a dual-stream representation: the high-level phonetic representation provides clean linguistic content, while a low-level acoustic representation retains speaker identity and prosody. Experimental results demonstrate that PASE not only surpasses state-of-the-art discriminative models in perceptual quality, but also significantly outperforms prior generative models with substantially lower linguistic and acoustic hallucinations.

Title: PyPeT: A Python Perfusion Tool for Automated Quantitative Brain CT and MR Perfusion Analysis
Authors: Marijn Borghouts, Ruisheng Su
Abstract: Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) and magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) are widely used in acute ischemic stroke assessment and other cerebrovascular conditions to generate quantitative maps of cerebral hemodynamics. While commercial perfusion analysis software exists, it is often costly, closed source, and lacks customizability. This work introduces PyPeT, an openly available Python Perfusion Tool for head CTP and MRP processing. PyPeT is capable of producing cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time-to-peak (TTP), and time-to-maximum (Tmax) maps from raw four-dimensional perfusion data. PyPeT aims to make perfusion research as accessible and customizable as possible. This is achieved through a unified framework in which both CTP and MRP data can be processed, with a strong focus on modularity, low computational burden, and significant inline documentation. PyPeT's outputs can be validated through an extensive debug mode in which every step of the process is visualized. Additional validation was performed via visual and quantitative comparison with reference perfusion maps generated by three FDA-approved commercial perfusion tools and a research tool. These comparisons show a mean SSIM around 0.8 for all comparisons, indicating a good and stable correlation with FDA-approved tools. The code for PyPeT is openly available at our GitHub this https URL

Title: Sensing-enabled Secure Rotatable Array System Enhanced by Multi-Layer Transmitting RIS
Authors: Maolin Li, Feng Shu, Minghao Chen, Cunhua Pan, Fuhui Zhou, Yongpeng Wu, Liang Yang
Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces and adjustable antennas are promising technologies. The security of a rotatable array system is investigated in this paper. A dual-base-station (BS) architecture is adopted, in which the BSs collaboratively perform integrated sensing of the eavesdropper (the target) and communication tasks. To address the security challenge when the sensing target is located on the main communication link, the problem of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) under sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements and discrete constraints is formulated. This problem involves the joint optimization of the array pose, the antenna distribution on the array surface, the multi-layer transmitting RIS phase matrices, and the beamforming matrices, which is non-convex. To solve this challenge, an two-stage online algorithm based on the generalized Rayleigh quotient and an offline algorithm based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared to conventional schemes without array pose adjustment, the proposed approach achieves approximately 22\% improvement in SR. Furthermore, array rotation provides higher performance gains than position changes.

Title: Event-triggered Dual Gradient Tracking for Distributed Resource Allocation
Authors: Xiayan Xu, Xiaomeng Chen, Dawei Shi, Ling Shi
Abstract: High communication costs create a major bottleneck for distributed resource allocation over unbalanced directed networks. Conventional dual gradient tracking methods, while effective for problems on unbalanced digraphs, rely on periodic communication that creates significant overhead in resource-constrained networks. This paper introduces a novel event-triggered dual gradient tracking algorithm to mitigate this limitation, wherein agents communicate only when local state deviations surpass a predefined threshold. We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for this approach. First, we prove sublinear convergence for non-convex dual objectives and linear convergence under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition. Building on this, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear convergence for general strongly convex cost functions and linear convergence for those that are also Lipschitz-smooth. Numerical experiments confirm that our event-triggered method significantly reduces communication events compared to periodic schemes while preserving comparable convergence performance.

Title: Microwave-acoustic-driven power electronics
Authors: Liyang Jin, Zichen Xi, Joseph G. Thomas, Jun Ji, Yuanzhi Zhang, Nuo Chen, Yizheng Zhu, Linbo Shao, Liyan Zhu
Abstract: Electrical isolation is critical to ensure safety and minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously transmit power and signals through a unified channel. Here we demonstrate a mechanically-isolated gate driver based on microwave-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) device on lithium niobate that achieves galvanic isolation of 2.75 kV with ultralow isolation capacitance (0.032 pF) over 1.25 mm mechanical propagation length, delivering 13.4 V open-circuit voltage and 44.4 mA short-circuit current. We demonstrate isolated gate driving for a gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor, achieving a turn-on time of 108.8 ns comparable to commercial drivers and validate its operation in a buck converter. In addition, our SAW device operates over an ultrawide temperature range from 0.5 K (-272.6 °C) to 544 K (271 °C). The microwave-frequency SAW devices offer inherent EMI immunity and potential for heterogeneous integration on multiple semiconductor platforms, enabling compact, high-performance isolated power and signal transmission in advanced power electronics.

Title: High-resolution hierarchical PV system performance modeling in urban environments
Authors: Bowen Tian, Roel C.G.M. Loonen, Roland M.E. Valckenborg, Jan L.M. Hensen
Abstract: Accurate performance modeling of PV systems in urban environments is a significant challenge due to complex partial shading. This study introduces a high-resolution, hierarchical modeling framework that provides detailed insights from the solar cell to the system level. Rigorously validated against field-test data from calibrated equipment, the model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting minute-wised dynamic electrical characteristics (R2 > 0.90). A key finding is the critical shortcoming of conventional, coarser-resolution models under realistic shading; these are shown to overestimate the actual string operating power by up to 163% and the monthly energy yield by up to 54%. The proposed framework avoids these errors by precisely capturing mismatch losses and the time-varying phenomena of system components, such as bypass diode activations. Furthermore, the model accurately quantifies the effectiveness of mitigation technologies, showing that Module-Level Power Electronics (MLPEs) can increase the monthly energy yield of a heavily shaded string by over 20%. This research provides a crucial tool for reliable system design, accurate power forecasting, and the optimization of PV systems in complex urban settings.

Title: Handover-Aware URLLC UAV Trajectory Planning: A Continuous-Time Trajectory Optimization via Graphs of Convex Sets
Authors: Yuqi Ping, Tingting Zhang, Tianhao Liang
Abstract: In this paper, we study a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which aims to fly between two predetermined locations while maintaining ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) for command-and-control (C2) links with terrestrial base stations (BSs). Long-range flights often trigger frequent inter-cell handovers, which may introduce delays and synchronization overhead. We jointly optimize the continuous trajectory and BS association to minimize handovers, path length, and flying time, subject to communication reliability and kinematic constraints. To address this problem, we reformulate it as an optimization based on the graph of convex sets (GCS). First, the URLLC requirement is translated into spatially feasible regions in the flight plane for each BS. And an intersection graph is constructed including the start and goal points. Each graph node is associated with a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory segment. The trajectory is parameterized in space by Bézier curves and in time by a monotonic Bézier scaling, together with convex constraints that ensure continuity and enforce speed bounds. Next, we impose unit-flow constraints to enforce a single path, and by coupling the resulting binary edge-selection variables with the convex constraints, we obtain a mixed-integer convex program (MICP). Applying a convex relaxation and rounding to the mixed-integer convex program produces nearly globally optimal routes, and a final refinement yields smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories. Simulations verify that the method preserves URLLC connectivity while achieving a clear trade-off between fewer handovers and flight efficiency.

Title: Systematic evaluation of time-frequency features for binaural sound source localization
Authors: Davoud Shariat Panah, Alessandro Ragano, Dan Barry, Jan Skoglund, Andrew Hines
Abstract: This study presents a systematic evaluation of time-frequency feature design for binaural sound source localization (SSL), focusing on how feature selection influences model performance across diverse conditions. We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using various combinations of amplitude-based features (magnitude spectrogram, interaural level difference - ILD) and phase-based features (phase spectrogram, interaural phase difference - IPD). Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain data with mismatched head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) reveal that carefully chosen feature combinations often outperform increases in model complexity. While two-feature sets such as ILD + IPD are sufficient for in-domain SSL, generalization to diverse content requires richer inputs combining channel spectrograms with both ILD and IPD. Using the optimal feature sets, our low-complexity CNN model achieves competitive performance. Our findings underscore the importance of feature design in binaural SSL and provide practical guidance for both domain-specific and general-purpose localization.

Title: The Liquid Buffer: Multi-Year Storage for Defossilization and Energy Security under Climate Uncertainty
Authors: Leonard Göke, Jan Wohland, Stefano Moret, André Bardow
Abstract: The climate-driven uncertainty of renewable generation and electricity demand challenges energy security in net-zero energy systems. By introducing a scalable stochastic model that implicitly accounts for 51'840 climate years, this paper identifies multi-year storage of liquid hydrocarbons as a key option for managing climate uncertainty and ensuring energy security. In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand.

Abstract: This contribution develops an algebraic approach to obtain a controller form for a class of linear hyperbolic MIMO systems, bidirectionally coupled with a linear ODE system at the unactuated boundary. After a short summary of established controller forms for SISO and MIMO ODE as well as SISO hyperbolic PDE systems, it is shown that the direct ap- proach to state a controller form fails already for a very simple MIMO example. Next, a generalised hyperbolic controller form with different variants is proposed and a new flatnesss-based scheme to compute said form is presented. Therein, the system is treated in an algebraic setting where generalised polynomials with real exponents are used to describe the predictions and delays in the system. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the motivating example.

Title: Data-driven Acceleration of MPC with Guarantees
Authors: Agustin Castellano, Shijie Pan, Enrique Mallada
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control but can be too slow for low-latency applications. We present a data-driven framework to accelerate MPC by replacing online optimization with a nonparametric policy constructed from offline MPC solutions. Our policy is greedy with respect to a constructed upper bound on the optimal cost-to-go, and can be implemented as a nonparametric lookup rule that is orders of magnitude faster than solving MPC online. Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds. Our experiments show that this policy is between 100 and 1000 times faster than standard MPC, with only a modest hit to optimality, showing potential for real-time control tasks.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlinear Output Regulation
Authors: Sebastiano Mengozzi, Giovanni B. Esposito, Michelangelo Bin, Andrea Acquaviva, Andrea Bartolini, Lorenzo Marconi
Abstract: This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold {\pi}(w) and a feedforward input c(w) that render such manifold invariant. The pair ({\pi}(w), c(w)) is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates {\pi}(w) and c(w) by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem.

Title: Smooth Total variation Regularization for Interference Detection and Elimination (STRIDE) for MRI
Authors: Alexander Mertens, Diego Martinez, Amgad Louka, Ying Yang, Chad Harris, Ian Connell
Abstract: MRI is increasingly desired to function near electronic devices that emit potentially dynamic electromagnetic interference (EMI). To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.

Title: Scalable Iterative Algorithm for Solving Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization
Authors: Benoît Jeanson, Mathieu Tanneau, Simon Tindemans
Abstract: Transmission System Operators routinely use transmission switching as a tool to manage congestion and ensure system security. Motivated by sub-transmission operations at RTE, this paper considers the Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization (OTSD), which captures potential loss of connectivity (and therefore localized blackout) following loss of transmission elements. While directly relevant to real-life operations, this problem has received very little attention in the literature. The paper proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for OTSD that represents post-contingency loss of connectivity without requiring additional binary variables. This new formulation provides the foundation for a fast, iterative heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments confirms that state-of-the-art optimization solvers struggle to solve the extensive formulation of OTSD, often failing to find even trivial solutions within reasonable time. In contrast, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, which finds high-quality feasible solutions 100-1000x faster than using Gurobi.

Title: Novel Stability Criteria for Discrete and Hybrid Systems via Ramanujan Inner Products
Authors: Shyam Kamal, Sunidhi Pandey, Thach Ngoc Dinh
Abstract: This paper introduces a Ramanujan inner product and its corresponding norm, establishing a novel framework for the stability analysis of hybrid and discrete-time systems as an alternative to traditional Euclidean metrics. We establish new $\epsilon$-$\delta$ stability conditions that utilize the unique properties of Ramanujan summations and their relationship with number-theoretic concepts. The proposed approach provides enhanced robustness guarantees and reveals fundamental connections between system stability and arithmetic properties of the system dynamics. Theoretical results are rigorously proven, and simulation results on numerical examples are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: Resilient Distribution Network Planning against Dynamic Malicious Power Injection Attacks
Authors: Hampei Sasahara, Tatsuya Yamada, Jun-ichi Imura, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: Active distribution networks facilitating bidirectional power exchange with renewable energy resources are susceptible to cyberattacks due to integration of a diverse array of cyber components. This study introduces a grid-level defense strategy aimed at enhancing attack resiliency based on distribution network planning. Our proposed framework imposes a security requirement into existing planning methodologies, ensuring that voltage deviation from its rated value remains within a tolerable range against dynamically and maliciously injected power at end-user nodes. Unfortunately, the formulated problem in its original form is intractable because it is an infinite-dimensional bi-level optimization problem over a function space. To address this complexity, we develop an equivalent transformation into a tractable form as mixed-integer linear program leveraging linear dynamical system theory and graph theory. Notably, our investigation reveals that the severity of potential attacks hinges solely on the cumulative reactances over the path from the substation to the targeted node, thereby reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional problem. Further, the bi-level optimization problem is reduced to a single-level optimization problem by using a technique utilized in solving the shortest path problem. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted on a 54-node distribution network benchmark, our proposed methodology exhibits a noteworthy 29.3% enhancement in the resiliency, with a mere 2.1% uptick in the economic cost.

Title: Lightweight Hopfield Neural Networks for Bioacoustic Detection and Call Monitoring of Captive Primates
Authors: Wendy Lomas, Andrew Gascoyne, Colin Dubreuil, Stefano Vaglio, Liam Naughton
Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is a sustainable method of monitoring wildlife and environments that leads to the generation of large datasets and, currently, a processing backlog. Academic research into automating this process is focused on the application of resource intensive convolutional neural networks which require large pre-labelled datasets for training and lack flexibility in application. We present a viable alternative relevant in both wild and captive settings; a transparent, lightweight and fast-to-train associative memory AI model with Hopfield neural network (HNN) architecture. Adapted from a model developed to detect bat echolocation calls, this model monitors captive endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata vocalisations. Lemur social calls of interest when monitoring welfare are stored in the HNN in order to detect other call instances across the larger acoustic dataset. We make significant model improvements by storing an additional signal caused by movement and achieve an overall accuracy of 0.94. The model can perform $340$ classifications per second, processing over 5.5 hours of audio data per minute, on a standard laptop running other applications. It has broad applicability and trains in milliseconds. Our lightweight solution reduces data-to-insight turnaround times and can accelerate decision making in both captive and wild settings.

Title: EPSegFZ: Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for Few- and Zero-Shot Scenarios with Language Guidance
Authors: Jiahui Wang, Haiyue Zhu, Haoren Guo, Abdullah Al Mamun, Cheng Xiang, Tong Heng Lee
Abstract: Recent approaches for few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation typically require a two-stage learning process, i.e., a pre-training stage followed by a few-shot training stage. While effective, these methods face overreliance on pre-training, which hinders model flexibility and adaptability. Some models tried to avoid pre-training yet failed to capture ample information. In addition, current approaches focus on visual information in the support set and neglect or do not fully exploit other useful data, such as textual annotations. This inadequate utilization of support information impairs the performance of the model and restricts its zero-shot ability. To address these limitations, we present a novel pre-training-free network, named Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for Few- and Zero-shot scenarios. Our EPSegFZ incorporates three key components. A Prototype-Enhanced Registers Attention (ProERA) module and a Dual Relative Positional Encoding (DRPE)-based cross-attention mechanism for improved feature extraction and accurate query-prototype correspondence construction without pre-training. A Language-Guided Prototype Embedding (LGPE) module that effectively leverages textual information from the support set to improve few-shot performance and enable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 5.68% and 3.82% on the S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks, respectively.

Title: Task-Aware 3D Affordance Segmentation via 2D Guidance and Geometric Refinement
Authors: Lian He, Meng Liu, Qilang Ye, Yu Zhou, Xiang Deng, Gangyi Ding
Abstract: Understanding 3D scene-level affordances from natural language instructions is essential for enabling embodied agents to interact meaningfully in complex environments. However, this task remains challenging due to the need for semantic reasoning and spatial grounding. Existing methods mainly focus on object-level affordances or merely lift 2D predictions to 3D, neglecting rich geometric structure information in point clouds and incurring high computational costs. To address these limitations, we introduce Task-Aware 3D Scene-level Affordance segmentation (TASA), a novel geometry-optimized framework that jointly leverages 2D semantic cues and 3D geometric reasoning in a coarse-to-fine manner. To improve the affordance detection efficiency, TASA features a task-aware 2D affordance detection module to identify manipulable points from language and visual inputs, guiding the selection of task-relevant views. To fully exploit 3D geometric information, a 3D affordance refinement module is proposed to integrate 2D semantic priors with local 3D geometry, resulting in accurate and spatially coherent 3D affordance masks. Experiments on SceneFun3D demonstrate that TASA significantly outperforms the baselines in both accuracy and efficiency in scene-level affordance segmentation.

Title: Target-Balanced Score Distillation
Authors: Zhou Xu, Qi Wang, Yuxiao Yang, Luyuan Zhang, Zhang Liang, Yang Li
Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables 3D asset generation by distilling priors from pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion models, but vanilla SDS suffers from over-saturation and over-smoothing. To mitigate this issue, recent variants have incorporated negative prompts. However, these methods face a critical trade-off: limited texture optimization, or significant texture gains with shape distortion. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis and reveal that this trade-off is fundamentally governed by the utilization of the negative prompts, where Target Negative Prompts (TNP) that embed target information in the negative prompts dramatically enhancing texture realism and fidelity but inducing shape distortions. Informed by this key insight, we introduce the Target-Balanced Score Distillation (TBSD). It formulates generation as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduces an adaptive strategy that effectively resolves the aforementioned trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TBSD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding 3D assets with high-fidelity textures and geometrically accurate shape.

Title: Fast 3D Surrogate Modeling for Data Center Thermal Management
Authors: Soumyendu Sarkar, Antonio Guillen-Perez, Zachariah J Carmichael, Avisek Naug, Refik Mert Cam, Vineet Gundecha, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Ricardo Luna Gutierrez
Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.

Title: Toward bilipshiz geometric models
Authors: Yonatan Sverdlov, Eitan Rosen, Nadav Dym
Abstract: Many neural networks for point clouds are, by design, invariant to the symmetries of this datatype: permutations and rigid motions. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether such networks preserve natural symmetry aware distances on the point cloud spaces, through the notion of bi-Lipschitz equivalence. This inquiry is motivated by recent work in the Equivariant learning literature which highlights the advantages of bi-Lipschitz models in other scenarios. We consider two symmetry aware metrics on point clouds: (a) The Procrustes Matching (PM) metric and (b) Hard Gromov Wasserstien distances. We show that these two distances themselves are not bi-Lipschitz equivalent, and as a corollary deduce that popular invariant networks for point clouds are not bi-Lipschitz with respect to the PM metric. We then show how these networks can be modified so that they do obtain bi-Lipschitz guarantees. Finally, we provide initial experiments showing the advantage of the proposed bi-Lipschitz model over standard invariant models, for the tasks of finding correspondences between 3D point clouds.

Title: Lessons Learned from Developing a Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Wearable for Local Voice-and-Vision Inference
Authors: Yonatan Tussa, Andy Heredia, Nirupam Roy
Abstract: Many promising applications of multimodal wearables require continuous sensing and heavy computation, yet users reject such devices due to privacy concerns. This paper shares our experiences building an ear-mounted voice-and-vision wearable that performs local AI inference using a paired smartphone as a trusted personal edge. We describe the hardware--software co-design of this privacy-preserving system, including challenges in integrating a camera, microphone, and speaker within a 30-gram form factor, enabling wake word-triggered capture, and running quantized vision-language and large-language models entirely offline. Through iterative prototyping, we identify key design hurdles in power budgeting, connectivity, latency, and social acceptability. Our initial evaluation shows that fully local multimodal inference is feasible on commodity mobile hardware with interactive latency. We conclude with design lessons for researchers developing embedded AI systems that balance privacy, responsiveness, and usability in everyday settings.

Title: Real-Time Speech Enhancement via a Hybrid ViT: A Dual-Input Acoustic-Image Feature Fusion
Authors: Behnaz Bahmei, Siamak Arzanpour, Elina Birmingham
Abstract: Speech quality and intelligibility are significantly degraded in noisy environments. This paper presents a novel transformer-based learning framework to address the single-channel noise suppression problem for real-time applications. Although existing deep learning networks have shown remarkable improvements in handling stationary noise, their performance often diminishes in real-world environments characterized by non-stationary noise (e.g., dog barking, baby crying). The proposed dual-input acoustic-image feature fusion using a hybrid ViT framework effectively models both temporal and spectral dependencies in noisy signals. Designed for real-world audio environments, the proposed framework is computationally lightweight and suitable for implementation on embedded devices. To evaluate its effectiveness, four standard and commonly used quality measurements, namely PESQ, STOI, Seg SNR, and LLR, are utilized. Experimental results obtained using the Librispeech dataset as the clean speech source and the UrbanSound8K and Google Audioset datasets as the noise sources, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and perceptual quality compared to the noisy input signal, achieving performance close to the clean reference.

Title: Learning the relative composition of EEG signals using pairwise relative shift pretraining
Authors: Christopher Sandino, Sayeri Lala, Geeling Chau, Melika Ayoughi, Behrooz Mahasseni, Ellen Zippi, Ali Moin, Erdrin Azemi, Hanlin Goh
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach for learning electroencephalography (EEG) representations from unlabeled data, reducing the need for expensive annotations for clinical applications like sleep staging and seizure detection. While current EEG SSL methods predominantly use masked reconstruction strategies like masked autoencoders (MAE) that capture local temporal patterns, position prediction pretraining remains underexplored despite its potential to learn long-range dependencies in neural signals. We introduce PAirwise Relative Shift or PARS pretraining, a novel pretext task that predicts relative temporal shifts between randomly sampled EEG window pairs. Unlike reconstruction-based methods that focus on local pattern recovery, PARS encourages encoders to capture relative temporal composition and long-range dependencies inherent in neural signals. Through comprehensive evaluation on various EEG decoding tasks, we demonstrate that PARS-pretrained transformers consistently outperform existing pretraining strategies in label-efficient and transfer learning settings, establishing a new paradigm for self-supervised EEG representation learning.

Title: SBAMP: Sampling Based Adaptive Motion Planning
Authors: Anh-Quan Pham, Kabir Ram Puri, Shreyas Raorane
Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems must navigate complex, dynamic environments in real time, often facing unpredictable obstacles and rapidly changing conditions. Traditional sampling-based methods, such as RRT*, excel at generating collision-free paths but struggle to adapt to sudden changes without extensive replanning. Conversely, learning-based dynamical systems, such as the Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), offer smooth, adaptive trajectory tracking but typically rely on pre-collected demonstration data, limiting their generalization to novel scenarios. This paper introduces Sampling-Based Adaptive Motion Planning (SBAMP), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating RRT* for global path planning with a SEDS-based local controller for continuous, adaptive trajectory adjustment. Our approach requires no pre-trained datasets and ensures smooth transitions between planned waypoints, maintaining stability through Lyapunov-based guarantees. We validate SBAMP in both simulated environments and real hardware using the RoboRacer platform, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic obstacle scenarios, rapid recovery from perturbations, and robust handling of sharp turns. Experimental results highlight SBAMP's ability to adapt in real time without sacrificing global path optimality, providing a scalable solution for dynamic, unstructured environments.

Title: DCA-LUT: Deep Chromatic Alignment with 5D LUT for Purple Fringing Removal
Authors: Jialang Lu, Shuning Sun, Pu Wang, Chen Wu, Feng Gao, Lina Gong, Dianjie Lu, Guijuan Zhang, Zhuoran Zheng
Abstract: Purple fringing, a persistent artifact caused by Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration (LCA) in camera lenses, has long degraded the clarity and realism of digital imaging. Traditional solutions rely on complex and expensive apochromatic (APO) lens hardware and the extraction of handcrafted features, ignoring the data-driven approach. To fill this gap, we introduce DCA-LUT, the first deep learning framework for purple fringing removal. Inspired by the physical root of the problem, the spatial misalignment of RGB color channels due to lens dispersion, we introduce a novel Chromatic-Aware Coordinate Transformation (CA-CT) module, learning an image-adaptive color space to decouple and isolate fringing into a dedicated dimension. This targeted separation allows the network to learn a precise ``purple fringe channel", which then guides the accurate restoration of the luminance channel. The final color correction is performed by a learned 5D Look-Up Table (5D LUT), enabling efficient and powerful% non-linear color mapping. To enable robust training and fair evaluation, we constructed a large-scale synthetic purple fringing dataset (PF-Synth). Extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in purple fringing removal.

Title: Fusion-ResNet: A Lightweight multi-label NILM Model Using PCA-ICA Feature Fusion
Authors: Sahar Moghimian Hoosh, Ilia Kamyshev, Henni Ouerdane
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an advanced load monitoring technique that uses data-driven algorithms to disaggregate the total power consumption of a household into the consumption of individual appliances. However, real-world NILM deployment still faces major challenges, including overfitting, low model generalization, and disaggregating a large number of appliances operating at the same time. To address these challenges, this work proposes an end-to-end framework for the NILM classification task, which consists of high-frequency labeled data, a feature extraction method, and a lightweight neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel feature extraction method that fuses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features. Moreover, we propose a lightweight architecture for multi-label NILM classification (Fusion-ResNet). The proposed feature-based model achieves a higher $F1$ score on average and across different appliances compared to state-of-the-art NILM classifiers while minimizing the training and inference time. Finally, we assessed the performance of our model against baselines with a varying number of simultaneously active devices. Results demonstrate that Fusion-ResNet is relatively robust to stress conditions with up to 15 concurrently active appliances.

Title: Novel Multi-objective Switched Model Predictive Control with Feasibility and Stability Guarantees
Authors: Elias Niepötter, Adrian Grimm, Torbjørn Cunis
Abstract: As the relevance of control systems capable of dealing with multiple objectives rises (e.g. being economic while maintaining a certain performance), multi-objective Switched Model Predictive Control combines all the advantages of Model Predictive Control while dealing with multiple objectives. We propose two novel frameworks, a nominal and a robust framework to guarantee recursive feasibility of each Model Predictive Controller under arbitrary switching and assure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system applying the nominal framework and Input-to-State stability using the robust framework. The presented frameworks employ methods from switched systems, enabling the utilization of a supervisor control instance which allows for complex objectives and multi-objective control. Our numerical example confirms the superior performance of our proposed frameworks compared to a standard Model Predictive Control approach.

Title: A digital SRAM-based compute-in-memory macro for weight-stationary dynamic matrix multiplication in Transformer attention score computation
Authors: Jianyi Yu, Yuxuan Wang, Xiang Fu, Fei Qiao, Ying Wang, Rui Yuan, Liyuan Liu, Cong Shi
Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) techniques are widely employed in energy-efficient artificial intelligent (AI) processors. They alleviate power and latency bottlenecks caused by extensive data movements between compute and storage units. This work proposes a digital CIM macro to compute Transformer attention. To mitigate dynamic matrix multiplication that is unsuitable for the common weight-stationary CIM paradigm, we reformulate the attention score computation process based on a combined QK-weight matrix, so that inputs can be directly fed to CIM cells to obtain the score results. Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders. The proposed CIM macro was implemented using a 65-nm process. It occupied only 0.35 mm2 area, and delivered a 42.27 GOPS peak performance with 1.24 mW power consumption at a 1.0 V power supply and a 100 MHz clock frequency, resulting in 34.1 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120.77 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency. When compared to the CPU and GPU, our CIM macro is 25x and 13x more energy efficient on practical tasks, respectively. Compared with other Transformer-CIMs, our design exhibits at least 7x energy efficiency and at least 2x area efficiency improvements when scaled to the same technology node, showcasing its potential for edge-side intelligent applications.

Title: Chicken Swarm Kernel Particle Filter: A Structured Rejuvenation Approach with KLD-Efficient Sampling
Authors: Hangshuo Tian
Abstract: Particle filters (PFs) are often combined with swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), for particle rejuvenation. Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood. This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense. By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters.

Title: SCI: An Equilibrium for Signal Intelligence
Authors: Vishal Joshua Meesala
Abstract: We present SCI, a closed-loop, control-theoretic framework that models interpretability as a regulated state. SCI formalizes the interpretive error Delta SP and actively drives SP(t) in [0, 1] ("Surgical Precision") toward a target via a projected update on the parameters Theta under a human-gain budget. The framework operates through three coordinated components: (1) reliability-weighted, multiscale features P(t, s); (2) a knowledge-guided interpreter psi_Theta that emits traceable markers and rationales; and (3) a Lyapunov-guided controller equipped with rollback, trust-region safeguards, and a descent condition. Across biomedical (EEG/ECG/ICU), industrial (bearings/tool wear), and environmental (climate/seismic) domains, SCI reduces interpretive error by 25-42% (mean 38%, 95% confidence interval 22-43%) relative to static explainers while maintaining AUC/F1 within approximately 1-2 percentage points of baseline. SCI also reduces SP variance from 0.030 to 0.011, indicating substantially more stable explanations. Modeling interpretability as a control objective yields steadier, faster-recovering, and more trustworthy interpretive behavior across diverse signal regimes.

Title: Prompt-Conditioned FiLM and Multi-Scale Fusion on MedSigLIP for Low-Dose CT Quality Assessment
Authors: Tolga Demiroglu (1), Mehmet Ozan Unal (1), Metin Ertas (2), Isa Yildirim (1) ((1) Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, (2) Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey)
Abstract: We propose a prompt-conditioned framework built on MedSigLIP that injects textual priors via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) and multi-scale pooling. Text prompts condition patch-token features on clinical intent, enabling data-efficient learning and rapid adaptation. The architecture combines global, local, and texture-aware pooling through separate regression heads fused by a lightweight MLP, trained with pairwise ranking loss. Evaluated on the LDCTIQA2023 (a public LDCT quality assessment challenge) with 1,000 training images, we achieve PLCC = 0.9575, SROCC = 0.9561, and KROCC = 0.8301, surpassing the top-ranked published challenge submissions and demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt-guided approach.

Title: Bregman geometry-aware split Gibbs sampling for Bayesian Poisson inverse problems
Authors: Elhadji Cisse Faye, Mame Diarra Fall, Nicolas Dobigeon, Eric Barat
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian framework for solving Poisson inverse problems by devising a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm which accounts for the underlying non-Euclidean geometry. To address the challenges posed by the Poisson likelihood -- such as non-Lipschitz gradients and positivity constraints -- we derive a Bayesian model which leverages exact and asymptotically exact data augmentations. In particular, the augmented model incorporates two sets of splitting variables both derived through a Bregman divergence based on the Burg entropy. Interestingly the resulting augmented posterior distribution is characterized by conditional distributions which benefit from natural conjugacy properties and preserve the intrinsic geometry of the latent and splitting variables. This allows for efficient sampling via Gibbs steps, which can be performed explicitly for all conditionals, except the one incorporating the regularization potential. For this latter, we resort to a Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo (HRLMC) algorithm which is well suited to handle priors with explicit or easily computable score functions. By operating on a mirror manifold, this Langevin step ensures that the sampling satisfies the positivity constraints and more accurately reflects the underlying problem structure. Performance results obtained on denoising, deblurring, and positron emission tomography (PET) experiments demonstrate that the method achieves competitive performance in terms of reconstruction quality compared to optimization- and sampling-based approaches.

Title: SAC-MoE: Reinforcement Learning with Mixture-of-Experts for Control of Hybrid Dynamical Systems with Uncertainty
Authors: Leroy D'Souza, Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant, Sebastian Fischmeister
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems result from the interaction of continuous-variable dynamics with discrete events and encompass various systems such as legged robots, vehicles and aircrafts. Challenges arise when the system's modes are characterized by unobservable (latent) parameters and the events that cause system dynamics to switch between different modes are also unobservable. Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization. To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments. Our curriculum strategy consistently improves performance across all evaluated policies. Qualitative analysis shows that the interpretable MoE router activates different experts for distinct latent modes.

Title: Learning to Control Misinformation: a Closed-loop Approach for Misinformation Mitigation over Social Networks
Authors: Nicolo' Pagan, Andreas Philippou, Giulia De Pasquale
Abstract: Modern social networks rely on recommender systems that inadvertently amplify misinformation by prioritizing engagement over content veracity. We present a control framework that mitigates misinformation spread while maintaining user engagement by penalizing content characteristics commonly exploited by false information, specifically, extreme negative sentiment and novelty. We extend the closed-loop Friedkin-Johnsen model to incorporate the mitigation of misinformation together with the maximization of user engagement. Both model-free and model-based control strategies demonstrate up to 76% reduction in misinformation propagation across diverse network configurations, validated through simulations using the LIAR2 dataset with sentiment features extracted via large language models. Analysis of engagement-misinformation trade-offs reveals that in networks with radical users, median engagement improves even as misinformation decreases, suggesting content moderation enhances discourse quality for non-extremist users. The framework provides practical guidance for platform operators in balancing misinformation suppression with engagement objectives.

Title: Design of A Low-Latency and Parallelizable SVD Dataflow Architecture on FPGA

Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and noise suppression, and it plays a pivotal role in numerous scientific and engineering applications. As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems,especially in time-sensitive scenarios with large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this express, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams. Compared with previous works, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces on-chip RAM consumption by 41.5 percent and improves computational efficiency by 23 times.

Authors: Jiachen Qian, Yang Zheng
Abstract: This letter studies the problem of online multi-step-ahead prediction for unknown linear stochastic systems. Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons $N$. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in $N$, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon $H$, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix.

Title: FERMI-ML: A Flexible and Resource-Efficient Memory-In-Situ SRAM Macro for TinyML acceleration
Authors: Mukul Lokhande, Akash Sankhe, S. V. Jaya Chand, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma
Abstract: The growing demand for low-power and area-efficient TinyML inference on AIoT devices necessitates memory architectures that minimise data movement while sustaining high computational efficiency. This paper presents FERMI-ML, a Flexible and Resource-Efficient Memory-In-Situ (MIS) SRAM macro designed for TinyML acceleration. The proposed 9T XNOR-based RX9T bit-cell integrates a 5T storage cell with a 4T XNOR compute unit, enabling variable-precision MAC and CAM operations within the same array. A 22-transistor (C22T) compressor-tree-based accumulator facilitates logarithmic 1-64-bit MAC computation with reduced delay and power compared to conventional adder trees. The 4 KB macro achieves dual functionality for in-situ computation and CAM-based lookup operations, supporting Posit-4 or FP-4 precision. Post-layout results at 65 nm show operation at 350 MHz with 0.9 V, delivering a throughput of 1.93 TOPS and an energy efficiency of 364 TOPS/W, while maintaining a Quality-of-Result (QoR) above 97.5% with InceptionV4 and ResNet-18. FERMI-ML thus demonstrates a compact, reconfigurable, and energy-aware digital Memory-In-Situ macro capable of supporting mixed-precision TinyML workloads.

Title: PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics for Faster Sampling of Generative Models
Authors: Hongyi Chen, Jianhai Shu, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li, Xiao-Ping Zhang
Abstract: Langevin dynamics sampling suffers from extremely low generation speed, fundamentally limited by numerous fine-grained iterations to converge to the target distribution. We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications.

Title: C3Net: Context-Contrast Network for Camouflaged Object Detection
Authors: Baber Jan, Aiman H. El-Maleh, Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui, Abdul Bais, Saeed Anwar
Abstract: Camouflaged object detection identifies objects that blend seamlessly with their surroundings through similar colors, textures, and patterns. This task challenges both traditional segmentation methods and modern foundation models, which fail dramatically on camouflaged objects. We identify six fundamental challenges in COD: Intrinsic Similarity, Edge Disruption, Extreme Scale Variation, Environmental Complexities, Contextual Dependencies, and Salient-Camouflaged Object Disambiguation. These challenges frequently co-occur and compound the difficulty of detection, requiring comprehensive architectural solutions. We propose C3Net, which addresses all challenges through a specialized dual-pathway decoder architecture. The Edge Refinement Pathway employs gradient-initialized Edge Enhancement Modules to recover precise boundaries from early features. The Contextual Localization Pathway utilizes our novel Image-based Context Guidance mechanism to achieve intrinsic saliency suppression without external models. An Attentive Fusion Module synergistically combines the two pathways via spatial gating. C3Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with S-measures of 0.898 on COD10K, 0.904 on CAMO, and 0.913 on NC4K, while maintaining efficient processing. C3Net demonstrates that complex, multifaceted detection challenges require architectural innovation, with specialized components working synergistically to achieve comprehensive coverage beyond isolated improvements.

Title: Task-Aware Morphology Optimization of Planar Manipulators via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Arvind Kumar Mishra, Sohom Chakrabarty
Abstract: In this work, Yoshikawa's manipulability index is used to investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a framework for morphology optimization in planar robotic manipulators. A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure. Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions.

Title: Extracting resilience events from utility outage data based on overlapping times and locations
Authors: Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson
Abstract: To study resilience with real data, it is necessary to group the individual outages recorded by utilities into events in which the outages bunch up and overlap due to extreme weather. We show how to automatically group utility outage data into resilience events based on their time and location. The methods work with both detailed utility outage data and EAGLE-I data.

Title: MSRNet: A Multi-Scale Recursive Network for Camouflaged Object Detection
Authors: Leena Alghamdi, Muhammad Usman, Hafeez Anwar, Abdul Bais, Saeed Anwar
Abstract: Camouflaged object detection is an emerging and challenging computer vision task that requires identifying and segmenting objects that blend seamlessly into their environments due to high similarity in color, texture, and size. This task is further complicated by low-light conditions, partial occlusion, small object size, intricate background patterns, and multiple objects. While many sophisticated methods have been proposed for this task, current methods still struggle to precisely detect camouflaged objects in complex scenarios, especially with small and multiple objects, indicating room for improvement. We propose a Multi-Scale Recursive Network that extracts multi-scale features via a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone and combines them via specialized Attention-Based Scale Integration Units, enabling selective feature merging. For more precise object detection, our decoder recursively refines features by incorporating Multi-Granularity Fusion Units. A novel recursive-feedback decoding strategy is developed to enhance global context understanding, helping the model overcome the challenges in this task. By jointly leveraging multi-scale learning and recursive feature optimization, our proposed method achieves performance gains, successfully detecting small and multiple camouflaged objects. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets for camouflaged object detection and ranks second on the remaining two. Our codes, model weights, and results are available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

Title: From Black-Box to White-Box: Control-Theoretic Neural Network Interpretability
Authors: Jihoon Moon
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.

Title: A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning
Authors: Liuyi Jin, Pasan Gunawardena, Amran Haroon, Runzhi Wang, Sangwoo Lee, Radu Stoleru, Michael Middleton, Zepeng Huo, Jeeeun Kim, Jason Moats
Abstract: Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) operate in high-pressure environments, making rapid, life-critical decisions under heavy cognitive and operational loads. We present EMSGlass, a smart-glasses system powered by EMSNet, the first multimodal multitask model for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and EMSServe, a low-latency multimodal serving framework tailored to EMS scenarios. EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.

Title: Transformer-Based Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Networked Systems with Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Vidur Sinha, Muhammed Ustaomeroglu, Guannan Qu
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.

Title: Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives
Authors: Ali Asadi, Krishnendu Chatterjee, David Lurie, Raimundo Saona
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.

Title: DiffFP: Learning Behaviors from Scratch via Diffusion-based Fictitious Play
Authors: Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant
Abstract: Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ faster convergence and 30$\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations

Title: Collision-Free Navigation of Mobile Robots via Quadtree-Based Model Predictive Control
Authors: Osama Al Sheikh Ali, Sotiris Koutsoftas, Ze Zhang, Knut Akesson, Emmanuel Dean
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated navigation framework for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) that unifies environment representation, trajectory generation, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed approach incorporates a quadtree-based method to generate structured, axis-aligned collision-free regions from occupancy maps. These regions serve as both a basis for developing safe corridors and as linear constraints within the MPC formulation, enabling efficient and reliable navigation without requiring direct obstacle encoding. The complete pipeline combines safe-area extraction, connectivity graph construction, trajectory generation, and B-spline smoothing into one coherent system. Experimental results demonstrate consistent success and superior performance compared to baseline approaches across complex environments.

Title: FoleyBench: A Benchmark For Video-to-Audio Models
Authors: Satvik Dixit, Koichi Saito, Zhi Zhong, Yuki Mitsufuji, Chris Donahue
Abstract: Video-to-audio generation (V2A) is of increasing importance in domains such as film post-production, AR/VR, and sound design, particularly for the creation of Foley sound effects synchronized with on-screen actions. Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes. We benchmark several state-of-the-art V2A models, evaluating them on audio quality, audio-video alignment, temporal synchronization, and audio-text consistency.

Title: Congestionamento Aeroportuario, Escassez de Capacidade e Planejamento na Macrometropole Paulista
Authors: Thayla M. G. Iglesias, Alessandro V. M. Oliveira
Abstract: This article presents an analytical account of the capacity limits and operational challenges of the main airports in the São Paulo Macrometropolis. Drawing on international examples, such as London Heathrow, it discusses how large hubs combine high traffic generation with severe physical constraints, highlighting how saturation intensifies delays, operating costs, and pressures for expansion. It analyzes capacity scarcity as a central economic problem, in which runways, aprons, boarding gates, and terminals become critical resources whose use requires administrative and market mechanisms, including slot coordination, prioritization rules, and regulatory incentives. It discusses the limitations imposed by high earthmoving costs, environmental impacts, and expropriation costs, which restrict the physical expansion of central airports such as Congonhas and increase dependence on efficiency gains. Demand projections indicate that the combined capacity of Congonhas, Guarulhos, and Viracopos is likely to be exceeded, even in conservative scenarios, reinforcing the urgency of integrated planning. The effects of regulatory restrictions on Congonhas, the challenges of expanding Guarulhos, and the structural difficulties of Viracopos are evaluated, highlighting the strategic relevance of this multi-airport system for sustaining national connectivity.

Title: Joint Transmit Beamforming and Reflection Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS Aided Multi-Cell MIMO Communication
Authors: Shuo Zheng, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will rely on ultra-dense multi-cell deployment to meet the high rate and connectivity demands. However, frequency reuse leads to severe inter-cell interference, particularly for cell-edge users, which limits the communication performance. To overcome this challenge, we investigate a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multi-cell multi-user downlink MIMO communication system, where a BD-RIS is deployed to enhance desired signals and suppress both intra-cell and inter-cell this http URL formulate the joint optimization problem of the transmit beamforming matrices at the BSs and the BD-RIS reflection matrix to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users, subject to the challenging unitary constraint of the BD-RIS reflection matrix and transmit power constraints at the BSs. To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems.

Title: PDRs4All XX. Haute Couture: Spectral stitching of JWST MIRI-IFU cubes with matrix completion
Authors: Amélie Canin, Cédric Févotte, Nicolas Dobigeon, Dries Van De Putte, Takashi Onaka, Olivier Berné
Abstract: MIRI is the imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from $4.9$ to $27.9$ $\mu$m onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.

Title: On the Capacity of Pixel Antenna based MIMO Communication
Authors: Shenrui Lin, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: Pixel antenna is a promising technology to enhance the wireless communication data rate by adaptively reconfiguring each antenna's radiation pattern via a so-called antenna coding technique which controls the states of switches connected to multiple pixel ports. This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity. Moreover, equipping the transceivers with pixel antennas can enhance the achievable rate of MIMO communications.

Title: Uniform Feasibility For Smoothed Backup Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Anil Alan, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: We study feasibility guarantees for safety filters developed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) when a safe set is defined using the pointwise minimum of continuously differentiable functions, a construction that is common for the backup CBF method and typically nonsmooth. We replace the minimum by its log-sum-exp (soft-min) smoothing and show that, under a strict safety condition, the smooth function becomes a CBF (or extended CBF) for a range of the smoothing parameter. For compact safe sets, we derive an explicit lower bound on the smoothing parameter that makes the smooth function a CBF and hence renders the corresponding safety filter feasible. For unbounded sets, we introduce tail conditions under which the smooth function satisfies an extended CBF condition uniformly. Finally, we apply these results to backup CBFs. We show that safety of a compact (terminal) backup set under a backup controller, together with a condition ensuring safety of the backup trajectories on the relevant boundary of the safe set, is sufficient for feasibility for backup CBFs. These results provide a recipe for a priori feasibility guarantees for smooth inner approximations of nonsmooth safe sets without the need for additional online certification.

Title: Naga: Vedic Encoding for Deep State Space Models
Authors: Melanie Schaller, Nick Janssen, Bodo Rosenhahn
Abstract: This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.

Title: Toward Conversational Hungarian Speech Recognition: Introducing the BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue Datasets
Authors: Máté Gedeon, Piroska Zsófia Barta, Péter Mihajlik, Tekla Etelka Gráczi, Anna Kohári, Katalin Mády
Abstract: The advancement of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been largely enhanced by extensive datasets in high-resource languages, while languages such as Hungarian remain underrepresented due to limited spontaneous and conversational corpora. To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\% on spontaneous and 4.8\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\% and 18.26\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages.

Title: HBNET-GIANT: A communication-efficient accelerated Newton-type fully distributed optimization algorithm
Authors: Souvik Das, Luca Schenato, Subhrakanti Dey
Abstract: This article presents a second-order fully distributed optimization algorithm, HBNET-GIANT, driven by heavy-ball momentum, for $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex objective functions. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed, and we demonstrate global linear convergence under certain sufficient conditions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that HBNET-GIANT with heavy-ball momentum achieves acceleration, and the corresponding rate of convergence is strictly faster than its non-accelerated version, NETWORK-GIANT. Moreover, we compare HBNET-GIANT with several state-of-the-art algorithms, both momentum-based and without momentum, and report significant performance improvement in convergence to the optimum. We believe that this work lays the groundwork for a broader class of second-order Newton-type algorithms with momentum and motivates further investigation into open problems, including an analytical proof of local acceleration in the fully distributed setting for convex optimization problems.

Title: Cross-Learning from Scarce Data via Multi-Task Constrained Optimization
Authors: Leopoldo Agorio, Juan Cerviño, Miguel Calvo-Fullana, Alejandro Ribeiro, Juan Andrés Bazerque
Abstract: A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.

Title: Study on the Fairness of Speaker Verification Systems on Underrepresented Accents in English
Authors: Mariel Estevez, Luciana Ferrer
Abstract: Speaker verification (SV) systems are currently being used to make sensitive decisions like giving access to bank accounts or deciding whether the voice of a suspect coincides with that of the perpetrator of a crime. Ensuring that these systems are fair and do not disfavor any particular group is crucial. In this work, we analyze the performance of several state-of-the-art SV systems across groups defined by the accent of the speakers when speaking English. To this end, we curated a new dataset based on the VoxCeleb corpus where we carefully selected samples from speakers with accents from different countries. We use this dataset to evaluate system performance for several SV systems trained with VoxCeleb data. We show that, while discrimination performance is reasonably robust across accent groups, calibration performance degrades dramatically on some accents that are not well represented in the training data. Finally, we show that a simple data balancing approach mitigates this undesirable bias, being particularly effective when applied to our recently-proposed discriminative condition-aware backend.

Title: Tubular Curvature Filter: Pointwise Curvature Calculation for Tubular Objects in Images
Authors: Elifnur Sunger, Beyza Kalkanli, Veysi Yildiz, Tales Imbiriba, Giovanna Guidoboni, Peter Campbell, Deniz Erdogmus
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate estimation of blood vessel tortuosity from medical images is an extremely important and challenging task. It is particularly relevant in the context of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), where the staging of disease severity and consequent therapeutic approaches are heavily informed by the presence and prominence of vessel tortuosity. Existing methods based on centerline or skeleton curvature fail to capture curvature gradients across a rotating tubular structure, thereby limiting their effectiveness in the case of ROP. Methods: This paper defines local tubular curvature and presents the Tubular Curvature Filter (TCF) method, which locally calculates the acceleration of curve bundles traversing a tubular object parallel to its centerline. This is achieved by examining the directional rate of change in the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of a tubular intensity function in space. TCF implicitly calculates the local tubular curvature without the need to explicitly segment or extracting the centerline of the tubular object. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that TCF provides accurate estimates of local curvature at any point inside tubular structures. Results on 2D and 3D images show that TCF discerns curvature differences between the inner and outer sides of curved tubular objects, while centerline-based approaches cannot. Conclusion: Our findings highlight that TCF's ability to discern between the inner and outer sides of curved tubular objects is particularly useful in medical fields that require vasculature curvature analysis from images, especially where vascular structures often have non-uniform diameters, such as in ROP.

Title: Towards Collective Intelligence: Uncertainty-aware SAM Adaptation for Ambiguous Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Mingzhou Jiang, Jiaying Zhou, Junde Wu, Tianyang Wang, Yueming Jin, Min Xu
Abstract: Collective intelligence from multiple medical experts consistently surpasses individual expertise in clinical diagnosis, particularly for ambiguous medical image segmentation tasks involving unclear tissue boundaries or pathological variations. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful vision foundation model originally designed for natural image segmentation, has shown remarkable potential when adapted to medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing SAM adaptation methods follow a single-expert paradigm, developing models based on individual expert annotations to predict deterministic masks. These methods systematically ignore the inherent uncertainty and variability in expert annotations, which fundamentally contradicts clinical practice, where multiple specialists provide different yet equally valid interpretations that collectively enhance diagnostic confidence. We propose an Uncertainty-aware Adapter, the first SAM adaptation framework designed to transition from single expert mindset to collective intelligence representation. Our approach integrates stochastic uncertainty sampling from a Conditional Variational Autoencoder into the adapters, enabling diverse prediction generation that captures expert knowledge distributions rather than individual expert annotations. We employ a novel position-conditioned control mechanism to integrate multi-expert knowledge, ensuring that the output distribution closely aligns with the multi-annotation distribution. Comprehensive evaluations across seven medical segmentation benchmarks have demonstrated that our collective intelligence-based adaptation achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new adaptation framework for reliable clinical implementation.

Title: A Model Predictive Control Scheme for Flight Scheduling and Energy Management of Electric Aviation Networks
Authors: Finn Vehlhaber, Mauro Salazar
Abstract: This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for flight scheduling and energy management of electric aviation networks, where electric aircraft transport passengers between electrified airports equipped with sustainable energy sources and battery storage, with the goal of minimizing grid dependency. Specifically, we first model the aircraft flight and charge scheduling problem jointly with the airport energy management problem, explicitly accounting for local weather forecasts. Second, we frame the minimum-grid-energy operational problem as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it in a receding horizon fashion, where the route assignment and charging decisions of each aircraft can be dynamically reassigned to mitigate disruptions. We showcase the proposed MPC scheme on real-world data taken from a conventional flight network and weather conditions in the US American North East. The proposed framework saves between 10 and 37% of grid energy requirements when compared to a baseline without re-routing. Hence, results show that MPC can effectively guarantee operation of the network by efficiently re-assigning flights and rescheduling aircraft charging, while maximizing the efficiency of the on-site energy systems.

Title: SomnoNet: A Lightweight and Interpretable Framework for Sleep Staging from Single-Channel EEG
Authors: Shengwei Guo, Guobing Sun
Abstract: Sleep quality is central to human health, yet reliable and scalable sleep assessment remains an unmet challenge in both clinical and home-care settings. Manual scoring is labor-intensive and impractical for long-term monitoring, whereas existing automatic approaches often lack computational efficiency, deployability, and interpretability. Here we present SomnoNet, a domain-informed neural architecture that unifies accurate, lightweight, and interpretable sleep staging. SomnoNet is an end-to-end framework that learns directly from raw single-channel EEG, eliminating hand-crafted preprocessing and achieving state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale benchmarks (80.9\% accuracy on SHHS; 88.0\% on Physio2018). We further develop SomnoNet-Nano, a highly compact variant that achieves an extreme parameter reduction-approximately 6\% of the smallest prior model-while still preserving more than 99\% of state-of-the-art accuracy, thereby enabling deployment on portable and wearable devices. To promote clinical trust, we conduct interpretability analyses that quantify the contribution of EEG features across epochs, exposing physiologically meaningful patterns that reveal the network's decision process. By jointly addressing accuracy, efficiency, and transparency, SomnoNet provides a practical pathway toward reliable and scalable AI-driven sleep assessment. The implementation is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Constructing Per-Shot Bitrate Ladders using Visual Information Fidelity
Authors: Krishna Srikar Durbha, Alan C. Bovik
Abstract: Video service providers need their delivery systems to be able to adapt to network conditions, user preferences, display settings, and other factors. HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) offers dynamic switching between different video representations to simultaneously enhance bandwidth consumption and users' streaming experiences. Per-shot encoding, pioneered by Netflix, optimizes the encoding parameters on each scene or shot. The Dynamic Optimizer (DO) uses the Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) perceptual video quality prediction engine to deliver high-quality videos at reduced bitrates. Here we develop a perceptually optimized method of constructing optimal per-shot bitrate and quality ladders, using an ensemble of low-level features and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) features. During inference, our method predicts the bitrate or quality ladder of a source video without any compression or quality estimation. We compare the performance of our model against other content-adaptive bitrate ladder prediction methods, a fixed bitrate ladder, and reference bitrate ladders constructed via exhaustive encoding using Bjontegaard-delta (BD) metrics. Our proposed method shows excellent gains in bitrate and quality against the fixed bitrate ladder and only small losses against the reference bitrate ladder, while providing significant computational advantages.

Title: Subjective and Objective Quality Evaluation of Super-Resolution Enhanced Broadcast Images on a Novel SR-IQA Dataset
Authors: Yongrok Kim, Junha Shin, Juhyun Lee, Hyunsuk Ko
Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is essential for displaying low-quality broadcast content on high-resolution screens. Recently, SR methods have been developed that not only increase resolution while preserving the original image information but also enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR images generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast content, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and improvements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original high-quality sources presents another significant challenge. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of research specifically addressing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of SR images under these conditions. In this work, we introduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K resolutions. We conducted a subjective quality evaluation to obtain Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for these SR images and performed a comprehensive human study to identify key factors influencing perceived quality. Finally, we evaluated the performance of existing IQA metrics on our dataset. This study reveals the limitations of current metrics, highlighting the need for a more robust IQA metric that better correlates with the perceived quality of SR images. The proposed dataset and the subjective evaluation platform are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Lina-Speech: Gated Linear Attention and Initial-State Tuning for Multi-Sample Prompting Text-To-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Théodor Lemerle, Téo Guichoux, Axel Roebel, Nicolas Obin
Abstract: Neural codec language models, built on transformer architecture, have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, excelling in voice cloning by treating it as a prefix continuation task. However, their limited context length hinders their effectiveness to short speech samples. As a result, the voice cloning ability is restricted to a limited coverage and diversity of the speaker's prosody and style. Besides, adapting prosody, accent, or appropriate emotion from a short prefix remains a challenging task. Finally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits inference throughput. In this work, we introduce Lina-Speech, a TTS model with Gated Linear Attention (GLA) to replace standard self-attention as a principled backbone, improving inference throughput while matching state-of-the-art performance. Leveraging the stateful property of recurrent architecture, we introduce an Initial-State Tuning (IST) strategy that unlocks the possibility of multiple speech sample conditioning of arbitrary numbers and lengths and provides a comprehensive and efficient strategy for voice cloning and out-of-domain speaking style and emotion adaptation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for controlling fine-grained characteristics such as prosody and emotion. Code, checkpoints, and demo are freely available: this https URL

Title: A Practical Validation of RIS Detection and Identification
Authors: Recep Vural, Aymen Khaleel, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.

Title: Time-Series-Informed Closed-loop Learning for Sequential Decision Making and Control
Authors: Sebastian Hirt, Lukas Theiner, Rolf Findeisen
Abstract: Closed-loop performance of sequential decision making algorithms, such as model predictive control, depends strongly on the choice of controller parameters. Bayesian optimization allows learning of parameters from closed-loop experiments, but standard Bayesian optimization treats this as a black-box problem and ignores the temporal structure of closed-loop trajectories, leading to slow convergence and inefficient use of experimental resources. We propose a time-series-informed multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework that aligns the fidelity dimension with closed-loop time, enabling intermediate performance evaluations within a closed-loop experiment to be incorporated as lower-fidelity observations. Additionally, we derive probabilistic early stopping criteria to terminate unpromising closed-loop experiments based on the surrogate model's posterior belief, avoiding full episodes for poor parameterizations and thereby reducing resource usage. Simulation results on a nonlinear control benchmark demonstrate that, compared to standard black-box Bayesian optimization approaches, the proposed method achieves comparable closed-loop performance with roughly half the experimental resources, and yields better final performance when using the same resource budget, highlighting the value of exploiting temporal structure for sample-efficient closed-loop controller tuning.

Title: Invariant Kalman Filter for Relative Dynamics
Authors: Tejaswi K. C., Maneesha Wickramasuriya, Silvere Bonnabel, Axel Barrau, Taeyoung Lee
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for invariant filtering of relative dynamics on Lie groups. We first revisit the notion of state trajectory independence, under which the estimation error evolves autonomously, and derive new equivalent conditions by decomposing the system vector field into left-invariant, intrinsic, and right-invariant components. Building on this result, we introduce the concept of relative trajectory independence to characterize when the relative motion between two dynamical systems is autonomous. A key theoretical finding is that relative trajectory independence automatically ensures state trajectory independence for the corresponding estimation error. This connection provides the foundation for constructing invariant filters that preserve the Lie group structure, maintain exact linearization of the error dynamics, and enable consistent covariance propagation. These are illustrated with numerical examples.

Title: Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System
Authors: HyunJoong Kim, Jip Kim
Abstract: To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.

Title: Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization Imaging
Authors: Yao Du, Jiaxin Zhuang, Xiaoyu Zheng, Jing Cong, Limei Guo, Chao He, Lin Luo, Xiaomeng Li
Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we construct a polarization imaging system and curate a new dataset of over 13,000 paired Polar-H&E images. Visualizations of polarization properties reveal distinctive optical signatures in pathological tissues, underscoring its diagnostic value. Building on this dataset, we propose PolarHE, a dual-modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the latter ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models.

Title: Deep Learning-based OTFS Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection with Plug-and-Play Framework
Authors: Xiaoqi Zhang, Zhitong Ni, Weijie Yuan, J. Andrew Zhang, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential for enabling reliable communication in high-mobility environments. However, the effectiveness of OTFS receivers relies on the inherent characteristic of the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel, where the sparsity of the discretized channel varies across different communication scenarios. For instance, the fractional Doppler effect reduces the inherent channel sparsity, which consequently degrades channel estimation accuracy and increases the complexity of symbol detection. Traditional algorithms relying on fixed sparsity priors often require manual design, while purely data-driven deep learning (DL) methods typically struggle to generalize across diverse channel conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised DL-based plug-and-play (PnP) framework that provides a flexible solution for OTFS receiver design. The proposed framework can be applied to both channel estimation and symbol detection, jointly leveraging the flexibility of optimization-based methods and the powerful generalization capability of data-driven models. Specifically, a lightweight encoder-decoder network (EDN) is incorporated as an implicit channel prior for channel estimation, enabling robust performance across varying levels of channel sparsity. Furthermore, for symbol detection, we realize the PnP framework with a time-domain matrix inversion for model-based equalization, followed by a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) pre-trained for specific constellations, thereby achieving low complexity and enabling flexible adaptation to various modulation formats. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.

Title: System Identification Under Multi-rate Sensing Environment
Authors: Hiroshi Okajima, Risa Furukawa, Nobutomo Matsunaga
Abstract: This paper proposes a system identification algorithm for systems with multi-rate sensors in a discrete-time framework. It is challenging to obtain an accurate mathematical model when the ratios of inputs and outputs are different in the system. A cyclic reformulation-based model for multi-rate systems is formulated, and the multi-rate system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system to derive the model under the multi-rate sensing environment. The proposed algorithm integrates a cyclic reformulation with a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system to enable precise identification of systems under the multi-rate sensing environment. The effectiveness of the proposed system identification method is demonstrated using numerical simulations.

Title: Federated Continual 3D Segmentation With Single-round Communication
Authors: Can Peng, Qianhui Men, Pramit Saha, Qianye Yang, Cheng Ouyang, J. Alison Noble
Abstract: Federated learning seeks to foster collaboration among distributed clients while preserving the privacy of their local data. Traditionally, federated learning methods assume a fixed setting in which client data and learning objectives remain constant. However, in real-world scenarios, new clients may join, and existing clients may expand the segmentation label set as task requirements evolve. In such a dynamic federated analysis setup, the conventional federated communication strategy of model aggregation per communication round is suboptimal. As new clients join, this strategy requires retraining, linearly increasing communication and computation overhead. It also imposes requirements for synchronized communication, which is difficult to achieve among distributed clients. In this paper, we propose a federated continual learning strategy that employs a one-time model aggregation at the server through multi-model distillation. This approach builds and updates the global model while eliminating the need for frequent server communication. When integrating new data streams or onboarding new clients, this approach efficiently reuses previous client models, avoiding the need to retrain the global model across the entire federation. By minimizing communication load and bypassing the need to put unchanged clients online, our approach relaxes synchronization requirements among clients, providing an efficient and scalable federated analysis framework suited for real-world applications. Using multi-class 3D abdominal CT segmentation as an application task, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization
Authors: Shreya Khisa, Ali Amhaz, Mohamed Elhattab, Chadi Assi, Sanaa Sharafeddine
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.

Title: Finite-Precision Conjugate Gradient Method for Massive MIMO Detection
Authors: Yiming Fang, Li Chen, Changsheng You, Dingzhu Wen, Pengcheng Zhu
Abstract: The implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for massive MIMO detection is computationally challenging, especially for a large number of users and correlated channels. In this paper, we propose a low computational complexity CG detection from a finite-precision perspective. First, we develop a finite-precision CG (FP-CG) detection to mitigate the computational bottleneck of each CG iteration and provide the attainable accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity analysis to reveal the impact of finite-precision arithmetic. A practical heuristic is presented to select suitable precisions. Then, to further reduce the number of iterations, we propose a joint finite-precision and block-Jacobi preconditioned CG (FP-BJ-CG) detection. The corresponding performance analysis is also provided. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detection.

Title: Anytime Safe Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Pol Mestres, Arnau Marzabal, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained reinforcement learning problems with anytime guarantees, meaning that the algorithmic solution returns a safe policy regardless of when it is terminated. Drawing inspiration from anytime constrained optimization, we introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Safe Gradient Flow (RL-SGF), an on-policy algorithm which employs estimates of the value functions and their respective gradients associated with the objective and safety constraints for the current policy, and updates the policy parameters by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that if the estimates are computed with a sufficiently large number of episodes (for which we provide an explicit bound), safe policies are updated to safe policies with a probability higher than a prescribed tolerance. We also show that iterates asymptotically converge to a neighborhood of a KKT point, whose size can be arbitrarily reduced by refining the estimates of the value function and their gradients. We illustrate the performance of RL-SGF in a navigation example.

Title: Multi-Scale Target-Aware Representation Learning for Fundus Image Enhancement
Authors: Haofan Wu, Yin Huang, Yuqing Wu, Qiuyu Yang, Bingfang Wang, Li Zhang, Muhammad Fahadullah Khan, Ali Zia, M.Saleh Memon, Syed Sohail Bukhari, Abdul Fattah Memon, Daizong Ji, Ya Zhang, Ghulam Mustafa, Yin Fang
Abstract: High-quality fundus images provide essential anatomical information for clinical screening and ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Yet, due to hardware limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE) that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA) module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts. Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.

Title: Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems
Authors: Jeffrey Alido, Tongyu Li, Yu Sun, Lei Tian
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR, CelebA ($64\times64$), and CelebA-HQ ($256\times256$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

Title: Bridging the Modality Gap: Enhancing Channel Prediction with Semantically Aligned LLMs and Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Zhaoyang Li, Qianqian Yang, Zehui Xiong, Zhiguo Shi, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction is essential in massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) systems to improve precoding effectiveness and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, existing methods often suffer from accumulated prediction errors and poor generalization to dynamic wireless environments. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable modeling and generalization capabilities in tasks such as time series prediction, making them a promising solution. Nevertheless, a significant modality gap exists between the linguistic knowledge embedded in pretrained LLMs and the intrinsic characteristics of CSI, posing substantial challenges for their direct application to channel prediction. Moreover, the large parameter size of LLMs hinders their practical deployment in real-world communication systems with stringent latency constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel prediction framework based on semantically aligned large models, referred to as CSI-ALM, which bridges the modality gap between natural language and channel information. Specifically, we design a cross-modal fusion module that aligns CSI representations . Additionally, we maximize the cosine similarity between word embeddings and CSI embeddings to construct semantic cues. To reduce complexity and enable practical implementation, we further introduce a lightweight version of the proposed approach, called CSI-ALM-Light. This variant is derived via a knowledge distillation strategy based on attention matrices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSI-ALM achieves a 1 dB gain over state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, under limited training data conditions, CSI-ALM-Light, with only 0.34M parameters, attains performance comparable to CSI-ALM and significantly outperforms conventional deep learning approaches.

Title: Towards Prospective Medical Image Reconstruction via Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport
Authors: Taoran Zheng, Yan Yang, Xing Li, Xiang Gu, Jian Sun, Zongben Xu
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.

Title: Customising Electricity Contracts at Scale with Large Language Models
Authors: Jochen L. Cremer
Abstract: The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLMs) in chats at scale. This work addresses core technical challenges in automating contract design under grid constraints, integrating LLMs with power system models, and ensuring secure, reliable interaction. We develop a chat system using functional programs for power system analysis, enabling users to request customised, technically feasible contracts at scale. We demonstrate high accuracy in executing engineering studies, robustness to user input variations, self-assessment of connection requests by small and medium enterprises, and potential for secure, chat-enabled maintenance planning. This initial study paves the way toward developing a tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.

Title: Unsupervised patch-based dynamic MRI reconstruction using learnable tensor function with implicit neural representation
Authors: Yuanyuan Liu, Yuanbiao Yang, Jing Cheng, Zhuo-Xu Cui, Qingyong Zhu, Congcong Liu, Yuliang Zhu, Jingran Xu, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Yanjie Zhu
Abstract: Dynamic MRI suffers from limited spatiotemporal resolution due to long acquisition times. Undersampling k-space accelerates imaging but makes accurate reconstruction challenging. Supervised deep learning methods achieve impressive results but rely on large fully sampled datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Recently, implicit neural representations (INR) have emerged as a powerful unsupervised paradigm that reconstructs images from a single undersampled dataset without external training data. However, existing INR-based methods still face challenges when applied to highly undersampled dynamic MRI, mainly due to their inefficient representation capacity and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose TenF-INR, a novel unsupervised framework that integrates low-rank tensor modeling with INR, where each factor matrix in the tensor decomposition is modeled as a learnable factor function. Specifically,we employ INR to model learnable tensor functions within a low-rank decomposition, reducing the parameter space and computational burden. A patch-based nonlocal tensor modeling strategy further exploits temporal correlations and inter-patch similarities, enhancing the recovery of fine spatiotemporal details. Experiments on dynamic cardiac and abdominal datasets demonstrate that TenF-INR achieves up to 21-fold acceleration, outperforming both supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art methods in image quality, temporal fidelity, and quantitative accuracy.

Title: Rethinking Whole-Body CT Image Interpretation: An Abnormality-Centric Approach
Authors: Ziheng Zhao, Lisong Dai, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie
Abstract: Automated interpretation of CT images-particularly localizing and describing abnormal findings across multi-plane and whole-body scans-remains a significant challenge in clinical radiology. This work aims to address this challenge through four key contributions: (i) On taxonomy, we collaborate with senior radiologists to propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification system, with 404 representative abnormal findings across all body regions; (ii) On data, we contribute a dataset containing over 14.5K CT images from multiple planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose OmniAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings on multi-plane and whole-body CT images based on text queries, while also allowing flexible interaction through visual prompts; (iv) On evaluation, we establish three representative tasks based on real clinical scenarios, and introduce a clinically grounded metric to assess abnormality descriptions. Through extensive experiments, we show that OmniAbnorm-CT can significantly outperform existing methods in both internal and external validations, and across all the tasks.

Title: An Explainable Deep Learning Framework for Brain Stroke and Tumor Progression via MRI Interpretation
Authors: Rajan Das Gupta, Md Imrul Hasan Showmick, Mushfiqur Rahman Abir, Shanjida Akter, Md. Yeasin Rahat, Md. Jakir Hossen
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages. We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation. The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\% and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.

Title: Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis
Authors: Tarun G, Naman Malpani, Gugan Thoppe, Sridharan Devarajan
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied in automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering them computationally infeasible to analyze entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches to achieve reliable diagnoses. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.

Title: Fast Equivariant Imaging: Acceleration for Unsupervised Learning via Augmented Lagrangian and Auxiliary PnP Denoisers
Authors: Guixian Xu, Jinglai Li, Junqi Tang
Abstract: In this work, we propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning framework to rapidly and efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data. From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to the vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our FEI schemes achieve an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net for X-ray CT reconstruction and image inpainting, with improved generalization performance.

Title: Learning Koopman Models From Data Under General Noise Conditions
Authors: Lucian Cristian Iacob, Máté Szécsi, Gerben Izaak Beintema, Maarten Schoukens, Roland Tóth
Abstract: This paper presents a novel identification approach of Koopman models of nonlinear systems with inputs under rather general noise conditions. The method uses deep state-space encoders based on the concept of state reconstructability and an efficient multiple-shooting formulation of the squared loss of the prediction error to estimate the dynamics and the lifted state from input-output data. Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an innovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise. It is shown that the proposed approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient due to the multiple-shooting formulation where, on subsections of the data, multi-step prediction errors can be calculated in parallel. The latter allows for efficient batch optimization of the network parameters and, at the same time, excellent long-term prediction capabilities of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by nonlinear benchmark examples and an experimental quadcopter setup.

Authors: Yuanwei Liu, Hao Jiang, Xiaoxia Xu, Zhaolin Wang, Jia Guo, Chongjun Ouyang, Xidong Mu, Zhiguo Ding, Arumugam Nallanathan, George K. Karagiannidis, Robert Schober
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.

Title: Fine-grained Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration
Authors: Xiangfei Sheng, Xiaofeng Pan, Zhichao Yang, Pengfei Chen, Leida Li
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in this https URL.

Title: Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model
Authors: Hyun-Jic Oh, Junsik Kim, Zhiyi Shi, Yichen Wu, Yu-An Chen, Peter K. Sorger, Hanspeter Pfister, Won-Ki Jeong
Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions by utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

Title: DoSReMC: Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification using Batch Normalization Adaptation
Authors: Uğurcan Akyüz, Deniz Katircioglu-Öztürk, Emre K. Süslü, Burhan Keleş, Mete C. Kaya, Gamze Durhan, Meltem G. Akpınar, Figen B. Demirkazık, Gözde B. Akar
Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their performance often declines when applied to data from different domains, primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability while reducing the computational cost of model training. DoSReMC can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and generalizable mammography classification systems.

Title: Frequency Selective Reflection of Wideband Signals with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Pedro H. C. de Souza (1), Luciano Mendes (1) ((1) National Institute of Telecommunications - Inatel)
Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection for wideband signals.

Title: A Joint Delay-Energy-Security Aware Framework for Intelligent Task Scheduling in Satellite-Terrestrial Edge Computing Network
Authors: Ting You, Yuhao Zheng, Kejia Peng, Chang Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for secure task scheduling in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs). The framework jointly considers secure user association and task offloading to balance transmission delay, energy consumption, and physical-layer security. To address the inherent complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages. In the first stage, a secrecy-aware user association strategy is designed by discretizing artificial noise (AN) power ratios and identifying feasible links that satisfy secrecy constraints, resulting in a set of candidate secure associations. In the second stage, we formulate a delay-energy-aware task scheduling problem as an integer linear program and solve it using a heuristic Mayfly Algorithm (MA) to obtain low-complexity, high-quality solutions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in achieving secure and efficient task scheduling under dynamic satellite environments.

Title: Geometric Decentralized Stability Condition for Power Systems Based on Projecting DW Shells
Authors: Linbin Huang, Liangxiao Luo, Ruohan Leng, Huanhai Xin, Dan Wang, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze multi-agent network systems, such as heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservativeness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a geometric decentralized stability condition based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell and its projections. Our approach provides a geometric interpretation of the small-gain and small-phase theorems and enables decentralized stability analysis of power systems, serving as a visualization method to understand the closed-loop interactions and assess the stability of large-scale network systems in a scalable and modular manner.

Title: Frequency Response Identification of Low-Order Systems: Finite-Sample Analysis
Authors: Arya Honarpisheh, Mario Sznaier
Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example, and numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the sample complexity bound.

Title: AHAMask: Reliable Task Specification for Large Audio Language Models without Instructions
Authors: Yiwei Guo, Bohan Li, Hankun Wang, Zhihan Li, Shuai Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu
Abstract: Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from prompt sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.

Title: Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch
Authors: Penggao Yan, Li-Ta Hsu
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.

Title: Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized Linear-Quadratic Control with Multiplicative Noise
Authors: Gabriel Diaz, Lucky Li, Wenhao Zhang
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

Title: Dedelayed: Deleting remote inference delay via on-device correction
Authors: Dan Jacobellis, Mateen Ulhaq, Fabien Racapé, Hyomin Choi, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar
Abstract: Video comprises the vast majority of bits that are generated daily, and is the primary signal driving current innovations in robotics, remote sensing, and wearable technology. Yet, the most powerful video understanding models are too expensive for the resource-constrained platforms used in these applications. One approach is to offload inference to the cloud; this gives access to GPUs capable of processing high-resolution videos in real time. But even with reliable, high-bandwidth communication channels, the combined latency of video encoding, model inference, and round-trip communication prohibits use for certain real-time applications. The alternative is to use fully local inference; but this places extreme constraints on computational and power costs, requiring smaller models and lower resolution, leading to degraded accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Dedelayed, a real-time inference system that divides computation between a remote model operating on delayed video frames and a local model with access to the current frame. The remote model is trained to make predictions on anticipated future frames, which the local model incorporates into its prediction for the current frame. The local and remote models are jointly optimized with an autoencoder that limits the transmission bitrate required by the available downlink communication channel. We evaluate Dedelayed on the task of real-time streaming video segmentation using the BDD100k driving dataset. For a round trip delay of 100 ms, Dedelayed improves performance by 6.4 mIoU compared to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference -- an equivalent improvement to using a model ten times larger.

Title: Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics
Authors: Ilija Tanasković, Ljiljana B. Lazarević, Goran Knežević, Nikola Milosavljević, Olga Dubljević, Bojana Bjegojević, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude and slope, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.

Title: Cramér-Rao Bound Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Uplink Communication System
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Yang Liu, Qiong Wu
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna (FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel fluid antenna (FA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters, and FA position configurations, which is a highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing FA in the ISAC system.

Title: Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-Level Dynamics and System-Level Strength
Authors: Kehao Zhuang, Huanhai Xin, Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) technology is widely regarded as a promising solution for future power systems dominated by power electronics. However, a precise method for quantifying GFM converter behavior and a universally accepted GFM definition remain elusive. Moreover, the impact of GFM on system stability is not precisely quantified, creating a significant disconnect between device and system levels. To address these gaps from a small-signal perspective, at the device level, we introduce a novel metric, the Forming Index (FI) to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage fluctuations. Rather than enumerating various control architectures, the FI provides a metric for the converter's GFM ability by quantifying its sensitivity to grid variations. At the system level, we propose a new quantitative measure of system strength that captures the multi-bus voltage stiffness, which quantifies the voltage and phase angle responses of multiple buses to current or power disturbances. We further extend and define this concept to grid strength and bus strength to identify weak areas within the system. Finally, we bridge the device and system levels by formally proving that GFM converters enhance system strength. Our proposed framework provides a unified benchmark for GFM converter design, optimal placement, and system stability assessment.

Title: 3D Cooperative User Tracking for Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Michiel Sandra, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) becomes an integral part of 6G networks, distributed ISAC (DISAC) is expected to enhance both sensing and communication performance through its decentralized architecture. This paper presents a complete framework to address the challenge of cooperative user tracking in DISAC systems. By incorporating a global probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and a field-of-view-aware access point (AP) management strategy, the framework enables accurate user tracking using radio signals while optimizing AP scheduling. In addition, a real-world distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. The results demonstrate that a centimeter-level root mean-square trajectory error can be achieved. Furthermore, the results show that it is not necessary to keep APs active at all times to maintain high tracking accuracy, indicating the need for robust and efficient AP management. These findings provide valuable insights into practical deployments and the further development of cooperative user tracking techniques in DISAC systems.

Title: Predictive Compensation in Finite-Horizon LQ Games under Gauss-Markov Deviations
Authors: Navid Mojahed, Mahdis Rabbani, Shima Nazari
Abstract: This paper develops a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon, discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games subject to Gauss-Markov execution deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player's control is corrupted by temporally correlated stochastic perturbations modeled as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process, while the opposing player has causal access to past deviations and employs a predictive feedforward strategy that anticipates their future effect. We derive closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation under the resulting perturbed closed loop, establish boundedness and sensitivity properties of the equilibrium trajectory, and characterize the reduction in expected cost achieved by optimal predictive compensation. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate performance gains relative to nominal Nash feedback across a range of disturbance persistence levels.

Title: A Dynamic Recurrent Adjacency Memory Network for Mixed-Generation Power System Stability Forecasting
Authors: Guang An Ooi, Otavio Bertozzi, Mohd Asim Aftab, Charalambos Konstantinou, Shehab Ahmed
Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.

Title: RCMCL: A Unified Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Multi-Modal (RGB-D, Skeleton, Point Cloud) Action Understanding
Authors: Hasan Akgul, Mari Eplik, Javier Rojas, Akira Yamamoto, Rajesh Kumar, Maya Singh
Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) with multi-modal inputs (RGB-D, skeleton, point cloud) can achieve high accuracy but typically relies on large labeled datasets and degrades sharply when sensors fail or are noisy. We present Robust Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning (RCMCL), a self-supervised framework that learns modality-invariant representations and remains reliable under modality dropout and corruption. RCMCL jointly optimizes (i) a cross-modal contrastive objective that aligns heterogeneous streams, (ii) an intra-modal self-distillation objective that improves view-invariance and reduces redundancy, and (iii) a degradation simulation objective that explicitly trains models to recover from masked or corrupted inputs. At inference, an Adaptive Modality Gating (AMG) network assigns data-driven reliability weights to each modality for robust fusion. On NTU RGB+D 120 (CS/CV) and UWA3D-II, RCMCL attains state-of-the-art accuracy in standard settings and exhibits markedly better robustness: under severe dual-modality dropout it shows only an 11.5% degradation, significantly outperforming strong supervised fusion baselines. These results indicate that self-supervised cross-modal alignment, coupled with explicit degradation modeling and adaptive fusion, is key to deployable multi-modal HAR.

Title: Distributed MIMO Positioning: Fundamental Limit Analysis and User Tracking Framework Design
Authors: Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Ali Al-Ameri, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.

Title: Unsupervised Motion-Compensated Decomposition for Cardiac MRI Reconstruction via Neural Representation
Authors: Xuanyu Tian, Lixuan Chen, Qing Wu, Xiao Wang, Jie Feng, Yuyao Zhang, Hongjiang Wei
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used to characterize cardiac morphology and function. To accelerate CMR imaging, various methods have been proposed to recover high-quality spatiotemporal CMR images from highly undersampled k-t space data. However, current CMR reconstruction techniques either fail to achieve satisfactory image quality or are restricted by the scarcity of ground truth data, leading to limited applicability in clinical scenarios. In this work, we proposed MoCo-INR, a new unsupervised method that integrates implicit neural representations (INR) with the conventional motion-compensated (MoCo) framework. Using explicit motion modeling and the continuous prior of INRs, MoCo-INR can produce accurate cardiac motion decomposition and high-quality CMR reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a new INR network architecture tailored to the CMR problem, which significantly stabilizes model optimization. Experiments on retrospective (simulated) datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoCo-INR over state-of-the-art methods, achieving fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at ultra-high acceleration factors (e.g., 20x in VISTA sampling). Additionally, evaluations on prospective (real-acquired) free-breathing CMR scans highlight the clinical practicality of MoCo-INR for real-time imaging. Several ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the critical components of MoCo-INR.

Title: A Scalable and Exact Relaxation for Densest $k$-Subgraph via Error Bounds
Authors: Ya Liu, Junbin Liu, Wing-Kin Ma, Aritra Konar
Abstract: Given an undirected graph and a size parameter $k$, the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem extracts the subgraph on $k$ vertices with the largest number of induced edges. While D$k$S is NP--hard and difficult to approximate, penalty-based continuous relaxations of the problem have recently enjoyed practical success for real-world instances of D$k$S. In this work, we propose a scalable and exact continuous penalization approach for D$k$S using the error bound principle, which enables the design of suitable penalty functions. Notably, we develop new theoretical guarantees ensuring that both the global and local optima of the penalized problem match those of the original problem. The proposed penalized reformulation enables the use of first-order continuous optimization methods. In particular, we develop a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm, where the non-convex proximal operator can be computed in closed form, resulting in low per-iteration complexity. We also provide convergence analysis of the algorithm. Experiments on large-scale instances of the D$k$S problem and one of its variants, the Densest ($k_1, k_2$) Bipartite Subgraph (D$k_1k_2$BS) problem, demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality.

Title: Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Yuto Watanabe, Sotaro Fushimi, Kazunori Sakurama
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As structural constraints on a control gain result in non-convexity in general, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions with the same sparsity pattern as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a nonlinear matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As its relaxation, we derive novel LMIs, one of which strictly covers the conventional relaxation, and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.

Title: A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models
Authors: Camilo Espinosa-Curilem, Millaray Curilem, Daniel Basualto
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chillán Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.

Title: Dynamic Risk Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles from Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Occupancy Heatmaps
Authors: Han Wang, Yuneil Yeo, Antonio R. Paiva, Jean Utke, Maria Laura Delle Monache
Abstract: Accurately assessing collision risk in dynamic traffic scenarios is a crucial requirement for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles~(AVs) and enables a comprehensive safety evaluation of automated driving systems. To that end, this paper presents a novel probabilistic occupancy risk assessment~(PORA) metric. It uses spatiotemporal heatmaps as probabilistic occupancy predictions of surrounding traffic participants and estimates the risk of a collision along an AV's planned trajectory based on potential vehicle interactions. The use of probabilistic occupancy allows PORA to account for the uncertainty in future trajectories and velocities of traffic participants in the risk estimates. The risk from potential vehicle interactions is then further adjusted through a Cox model\edit{,} which considers the relative \edit{motion} between the AV and surrounding traffic participants. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the accuracy of collision risk assessment in dynamic traffic scenarios, resulting in safer vehicle controllers, and provides a robust framework for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving systems. From evaluation in Monte Carlo simulations, PORA is shown to be more effective at accurately characterizing collision risk compared to other safety surrogate measures.

Title: Sequential Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions
Authors: Muhua Zhang, Lei Ma, Ying Wu, Kai Shen, Yongkui Sun, Henry Leung
Abstract: This paper proposes a 2-D autonomous exploration and mapping framework for LiDAR-based SLAM mobile robots, designed to address the major challenges on low-cost platforms, including process instability, map drift, and increased risks of collisions and deadlocks. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. For local exploration, the proposed Self-Convergent RRT (SC-RRT) efficiently covers the reachable space within a finite time while the robot remains stationary, without relying on motion-induced sampling diversity. In addition, traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is employed to generate motion trajectories that are more amenable to stable scan matching. The resulting straight-segment and in-place-rotation pattern improves scan-matching robustness and effectively suppresses map drift on resource-constrained platforms. For the process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillations caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is incorporated to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency. Experiments in challenging simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves higher mapping success rates and stronger robustness on resource-constrained robots and maintains consistent mapping quality across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.

Title: Less is More: Contextual Sampling for Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control
Authors: Julius Beerwerth, Bassam Alrifaee
Abstract: Data-Driven Predictive Control (DPC) optimizes system behavior directly from measured trajectories without requiring an explicit model. However, its computational cost scales with dataset size, limiting real-time applicability to nonlinear robotic systems. For robotic tasks such as trajectory tracking and motion planning, real-time feasibility and numerical robustness are essential. Nonlinear DPC often relies on large datasets or learned nonlinear representations to ensure accuracy, both of which increase computational demand. We propose Contextual Sampling, a dynamic data selection strategy that adaptively selects the most relevant trajectories based on the current state and reference. By reducing dataset size while preserving representativeness, it improves computational efficiency. Experiments on a scaled autonomous vehicle and a quadrotor show that Contextual Sampling achieves comparable or better tracking than Random Sampling with fewer trajectories, enabling real-time feasibility. Compared with Select-DPC, it achieves similar tracking accuracy at lower computational cost. In comparison with the full DPC formulation without sampling, Contextual Sampling attains comparable tracking performance while requiring less computation, highlighting the benefit of efficient data selection in data-driven predictive control.

Title: JAFAR: Jack up Any Feature at Any Resolution
Authors: Paul Couairon, Loick Chambon, Louis Serrano, Jean-Emmanuel Haugeard, Matthieu Cord, Nicolas Thome
Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

Title: AI-Native Open RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview
Authors: Jikang Deng, Fizza Hassan, Hui Zhou, Saad Al-Ahmadi, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Daniel B. Da Costa
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN) is expected to be a critical component of Sixth Generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous services and enhancing the system resilience. However, the high-altitude operation and inherent mobility of NTN introduce significant challenges across the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. Apart from that, how to achieve artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities in NTN for intelligent network management and orchestration remains an important challenge. To solve the challenges above, we propose integrating the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) with NTN as a promising solution, leveraging its principles of disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive technical literature on ORAN and NTN, respectively, there is a lack of a holistic view of the integration of ORAN and NTN architectures, particularly in terms of how intelligent ORAN can address the scalability challenge in NTN management. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured overview of an AI-native ORAN-based NTN framework to support dynamic configuration, scalability, and intelligent orchestration. The paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature from leading industry and academic institutions, subsequently providing the necessary background knowledge related to ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the unique DevOps challenges for NTN and proposes the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework, with a detailed discussion on the key technological enablers within the framework. Finally, this paper presents various use cases and outlines the prospective research directions of this study in detail.

Title: READ: Real-time and Efficient Asynchronous Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Head Generation
Authors: Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Jun Du, Haoran Xu, Xiaoyan Wu, Shan He, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Jianqing Gao, Qingfeng Liu
Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, a real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference processes of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Title: Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control: Extended Version
Authors: Zewen Yang, Dongfa Zhang, Xiaobing Dai, Fengyi Yu, Chi Zhang, Bingkun Huang, Hamid Sadeghian, Sami Haddadin
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Phase-Pole-Free Images and Smooth Coil Sensitivity Maps by Regularized Nonlinear Inversion
Authors: Moritz Blumenthal, Martin Uecker
Abstract: Purpose: Phase singularities are a common problem in image reconstruction with auto-calibrated sensitivities due to an inherent ambiguity of the estimation problem. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for detecting and correcting phase poles in non-linear inverse (NLINV) reconstruction of MR images and coil sensitivity maps. Methods: Phase poles are detected in individual coil sensitivity maps by computing the curl in each pixel. A weighted average of the curl in each coil is computed to detect phase poles. Phase pole detection and correction is then integrated into the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method of the NLINV algorithm, which then avoid phase singularities in the reconstructed images. The method is evaluated for reconstruction of accelerated Cartesian MPRAGE data of the brain and interactive radial real-time MRI of the human heart. Results: Phase poles are reliably removed in NLINV reconstructions for both applications. NLINV with phase pole correction can reliably and efficiently estimate coil sensitivity profiles free from singularities even from very small ($7\times7$) auto-calibration (AC) regions. Conclusion: NLINV emerges as an efficient and reliable tool for image reconstruction and coil sensitivity estimation in challenging MRI applications.

Title: DualSpeechLM: Towards Unified Speech Understanding and Generation via Dual Speech Token Modeling with Large Language Models
Authors: Yuanyuan Wang, Dongchao Yang, Yiwen Shao, Hangting Chen, Jiankun Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Helen Meng, Xixin Wu
Abstract: Extending pre-trained text Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.

Title: Multi-Metric Preference Alignment for Generative Speech Restoration
Authors: Junan Zhang, Xueyao Zhang, Jing Yang, Yuancheng Wang, Fan Fan, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

Title: Audio Palette: A Diffusion Transformer with Multi-Signal Conditioning for Controllable Foley Synthesis
Authors: Junnuo Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled high-quality text-to-audio synthesis, but fine-grained acoustic control remains a significant challenge in open-source research. We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more artist-centric workflow.

Title: zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks
Authors: Paritosh Ramanan, H.M. Mohaimanul Islam, Abhiram Reddy Alugula
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.

Title: MusRec: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Rectified Flow and Diffusion Transformers
Authors: Ali Boudaghi, Hadi Zare
Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences. However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true zero-shot capability. leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, a zero-shot text-to-music editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.

Title: HQ-SVC: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion in Low-Resource Scenarios
Authors: Bingsong Bai, Yizhong Geng, Fengping Wang, Cong Wang, Puyuan Guo, Yingming Gao, Ya Li
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC) transforms a source singer's timbre to an unseen target speaker's voice while preserving melodic content without fine-tuning. Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks.

Title: Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements
Authors: Weijia Zhao, Linlin Li, Kaiqi Kuang, Yang Lin, Claudio Bruschini, Jiaming Cao, Ting Li, Edoardo Charbon, Wuwei Ren
Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.
