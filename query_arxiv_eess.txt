Title: Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Classification of Kidney CT Images: Diagnosis of Stones, Cysts, and Tumors
Authors: Kiran Sharma, Ziya Uddin, Adarsh Wadal, Dhruv Gupta
Abstract: Medical image classification is a vital research area that utilizes advanced computational techniques to improve disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have transformed this field by providing automated and precise analysis of complex medical images. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning model that integrates a pre-trained ResNet101 with a custom CNN to classify kidney CT images into four categories: normal, stone, cyst, and tumor. The proposed model leverages feature fusion to enhance classification accuracy, achieving 99.73% training accuracy and 100% testing accuracy. Using a dataset of 12,446 CT images and advanced feature mapping techniques, the hybrid CNN model outperforms standalone ResNet101. This architecture delivers a robust and efficient solution for automated kidney disease diagnosis, providing improved precision, recall, and reduced testing time, making it highly suitable for clinical applications.

Title: Distributed Resilient Asymmetric Bipartite Consensus: A Data-Driven Event-Triggered Mechanism
Authors: Yi Zhang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Shan Zuo
Abstract: The problem of asymmetric bipartite consensus control is investigated within the context of nonlinear, discrete-time, networked multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To address the challenges posed by these aperiodic DoS attacks, a data-driven event-triggered (DDET) mechanism has been developed. This mechanism is specifically designed to synchronize the states of the follower agents with the leader's state, even in the face of aperiodic communication disruptions and data losses. Given the constraints of unavailable agents' states and data packet loss during these attacks, the DDET control framework resiliently achieves leader-follower consensus. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two numerical examples, which showcase its ability to adeptly handle the complexities arising from aperiodic DoS attacks in nonlinear MAS settings.

Title: GenVC: Self-Supervised Zero-Shot Voice Conversion
Authors: Zexin Cai, Henry Li Xinyuan, Ashi Garg, Leibny Paola García-Perera, Kevin Duh, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Matthew Wiesner, Nicholas Andrews
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion has recently made substantial progress, but many models still depend on external supervised systems to disentangle speaker identity and linguistic content. Furthermore, current methods often use parallel conversion, where the converted speech inherits the source utterance's temporal structure, restricting speaker similarity and privacy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVC, a generative zero-shot voice conversion model. GenVC learns to disentangle linguistic content and speaker style in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for external models and enabling efficient training on large, unlabeled datasets. Experimental results show that GenVC achieves state-of-the-art speaker similarity while maintaining naturalness competitive with leading approaches. Its autoregressive generation also allows the converted speech to deviate from the source utterance's temporal structure. This feature makes GenVC highly effective for voice anonymization, as it minimizes the preservation of source prosody and speaker characteristics, enhancing privacy protection.

Title: Generative Autoregressive Transformers for Model-Agnostic Federated MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Valiyeh A. Nezhad, Gokberk Elmas, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Tolga Çukur
Abstract: Although learning-based models hold great promise for MRI reconstruction, single-site models built on limited local datasets often suffer from poor generalization. This challenge has spurred interest in collaborative model training on multi-site datasets via federated learning (FL) -- a privacy-preserving framework that aggregates model updates instead of sharing imaging data. Conventional FL builds a global model by aggregating locally trained model weights, inherently constraining all sites to a homogeneous model architecture. This rigid homogeneity requirement forces sites to forgo architectures tailored to their compute infrastructure and application-specific demands. Consequently, existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction fail to support model-heterogeneous settings, where individual sites are allowed to use distinct architectures. To overcome this fundamental limitation, here we introduce FedGAT, a novel model-agnostic FL technique based on generative autoregressive transformers. FedGAT decentralizes the training of a global generative prior that captures the distribution of multi-site MR images. For enhanced fidelity, we propose a novel site-prompted GAT prior that controllably synthesizes MR images from desired sites via autoregressive prediction across spatial scales. Each site then trains its site-specific reconstruction model -- using its preferred architecture -- on a hybrid dataset comprising the local MRI dataset and GAT-generated synthetic MRI datasets for other sites. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional datasets demonstrate that FedGAT supports flexible collaborations while enjoying superior within-site and across-site reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Based Prediction of PID Controller Gains for Quadrotor UAVs
Authors: Serhat Sönmez, Luca Montecchio, Simone Martini, Matthew J. Rutherford, Alessandro Rizzo, Margareta Stefanovic, Kimon P. Valavanis
Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) based methodology is proposed and implemented for online fine-tuning of PID controller gains, thus, improving quadrotor effective and accurate trajectory tracking. The RL agent is first trained offline on a quadrotor PID attitude controller and then validated through simulations and experimental flights. RL exploits a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which is an off-policy actor-critic method. Training and simulation studies are performed using Matlab/Simulink and the UAV Toolbox Support Package for PX4 Autopilots. Performance evaluation and comparison studies are performed between the hand-tuned and RL-based tuned approaches. The results show that the controller parameters based on RL are adjusted during flights, achieving the smallest attitude errors, thus significantly improving attitude tracking performance compared to the hand-tuned approach.

Title: A Fractional-Order Nonlinear Backstepping Controller Design for Current-Controlled Maglev System
Authors: Dorukhan Astekin, Fatih Adıgüzel
Abstract: The magnetic levitation system (Maglev) is a nonlinear system by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. The main control perspective of the Maglev system is to levitate a steel ball in air by the electromagnetic force. However, the Maglev system has highly nonlinear dynamics which is inconvenient in the sense of sensitive control/regulation of its nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, the nonlinear backstepping controller based on the fractional-order derivative is proposed for the control of the nonlinear current-controlled Maglev system. After, the system dynamics and fractional-order backstepping controller design are given, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved by employing the Lyapunov theory. Some computer-based numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the control of Maglev system.

Title: Dynamic Incentive Selection for Hierarchical Convex Model Predictive Control
Authors: Akshay Thirugnanam, Koushil Sreenath
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss incentive design for hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) systems viewed as Stackelberg games. We consider a hierarchical MPC formulation where, given a lower-level convex MPC (LoMPC), the upper-level system solves a bilevel MPC (BiMPC) subject to the constraint that the lower-level system inputs are optimal for the LoMPC. Such hierarchical problems are challenging due to optimality constraints in the BiMPC formulation. We analyze an incentive Stackelberg game variation of the problem, where the BiMPC provides additional incentives for the LoMPC cost function, which grants the BiMPC influence over the LoMPC inputs. We show that for such problems, the BiMPC can be reformulated as a simpler optimization problem, and the optimal incentives can be iteratively computed without knowing the LoMPC cost function. We extend our formulation for the case of multiple LoMPCs and propose an algorithm that finds bounded suboptimal solutions for the BiMPC. We demonstrate our algorithm for a dynamic price control example, where an independent system operator (ISO) sets the electricity prices for electric vehicle (EV) charging with the goal of minimizing a social cost and satisfying electricity generation constraints. Notably, our method scales well to large EV population sizes.

Title: End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control
Authors: Xiaole Zhang, Peiyu Zhang, Xiongye Xiao, Shixuan Li, Vasileios Tzoumas, Vijay Gupta, Paul Bogdan
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via \textit{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) for \textit{fractional-order linear time-invariant }(FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, \textbf{F}ractional-\textbf{O}rder \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{C}ontrol (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.

Title: OTFS-ISAC System with Sub-Nyquist ADC Sampling Rate
Authors: Henglin Pu, Xuefeng Wang, Ajay Kumar, Lu Su, Husheng Li
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless communication and radar systems, enabling high-resolution sensing and high-throughput communication with shared spectrum and hardware. However, achieving a fine radar resolution often requires high-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and substantial storage, making it both expensive and impractical for many commercial applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based ISAC architecture that operates at reduced ADC sampling rates, yet preserves accurate radar estimation and supports simultaneous communication. The proposed architecture introduces pilot symbols directly in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain to leverage the transformation mapping between the DD and time-frequency (TF) domains to keep selected subcarriers active while others are inactive, allowing the radar receiver to exploit under-sampling aliasing and recover the original DD signal at much lower sampling rates. To further enhance the radar accuracy, we develop an iterative interference estimation and cancellation algorithm that mitigates data symbol interference. We propose a code-based spreading technique that distributes data across the DD domain to preserve the maximum unambiguous radar sensing range. For communication, we implement a complete transceiver pipeline optimized for reduced sampling rate system, including synchronization, channel estimation, and iterative data detection. Experimental results from a software-defined radio (SDR)-based testbed confirm that our method substantially lowers the required sampling rate without sacrificing radar sensing performance and ensures reliable communication.

Title: Multi-Agent Coverage Control in Non-Convex Annulus Region with Conformal Mapping
Authors: Xun Feng, Chao Zhai
Abstract: Efficiently fulfilling coverage tasks in non-convex regions has long been a significant challenge for multi-agent systems (MASs). By leveraging conformal mapping, this paper introduces a novel sectorial coverage formulation to transform a non-convex annulus region into a topologically equivalent one. This approach enables the deployment of MASs in a non-star-shaped region while optimizing coverage performance and achieving load balance among sub-regions. It provides a unique perspective on the partitioned sub-regions to highlight the geodesic convex property of the non-star-shaped region. By utilizing the sectorial partition mechanism and the diffeomorphism property of conformal mapping, a decentralized control law is designed to drive MASs towards a desired configuration, which not only optimizes the global coverage cost but also ensures exponential convergence of equitable workload. Moreover, an iterative search algorithm is developed to identify the optimal approximation of multi-agent deployment in the non-star-shaped region. Theoretical analysis is conducted to confirm the asymptotic stability and global convergence with arbitrary small tolerance of the closed-loop system. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the practicality of the proposed coverage formulation with conformal mapping.

Title: Leveraging band diversity for feature selection in EO data
Authors: Sadia Hussain, Brejesh Lall
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a powerful earth observation technology that captures and processes information across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging provides comprehensive and detailed spectral data that is invaluable for a wide range of reconstruction problems. However due to complexity in analysis it often becomes difficult to handle this data. To address the challenge of handling large number of bands in reconstructing high quality HSI, we propose to form groups of bands. In this position paper we propose a method of selecting diverse bands using determinantal point processes in correlated bands. To address the issue of overlapping bands that may arise from grouping, we use spectral angle mapper analysis. This analysis can be fed to any Machine learning model to enable detailed analysis and monitoring with high precision and accuracy.

Title: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: Extending OFDM for Scenario-Flexibility and Resilience
Authors: Haoran Yin, Yanqun Tang, Ali Bemani, Marios Kountouris, Yu Zhou, Xingyao Zhang, Yuqing Liu, Gaojie Chen, Kai Yang, Fan Liu, Christos Masouros, Shuangyang Li, Giuseppe Caire, Pei Xiao
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are conceived to provide reliable and high-data-rate communication services for diverse scenarios, such as vehicle-to-vehicle, unmanned aerial vehicles, and satellite networks. The severe Doppler spreads in the underlying time-varying channels induce destructive inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the extensively adopted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, leading to severe performance degradation. This calls for a new air interface design that can accommodate the severe delay-Doppler spreads in highly dynamic channels while possessing sufficient flexibility to cater to various applications. This article provides a comprehensive overview of a promising chirp-based waveform named affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). It is featured with two tunable parameters and achieves optimal diversity order in doubly dispersive channels (DDC). We study the fundamental principle of AFDM, illustrating its intrinsic suitability for DDC. Based on that, several potential applications of AFDM are explored. Furthermore, the major challenges and the corresponding solutions of AFDM are presented, followed by several future research directions. Finally, we draw some instructive conclusions about AFDM, hoping to provide useful inspiration for its development.

Title: Efficient Evaluation of Quantization-Effects in Neural Codecs
Authors: Wolfgang Mack, Ahmed Mustafa, Rafał Łaganowski, Samer Hijazy
Abstract: Neural codecs, comprising an encoder, quantizer, and decoder, enable signal transmission at exceptionally low bitrates. Training these systems requires techniques like the straight-through estimator, soft-to-hard annealing, or statistical quantizer emulation to allow a non-zero gradient across the quantizer. Evaluating the effect of quantization in neural codecs, like the influence of gradient passing techniques on the whole system, is often costly and time-consuming due to training demands and the lack of affordable and reliable metrics. This paper proposes an efficient evaluation framework for neural codecs using simulated data with a defined number of bits and low-complexity neural encoders/decoders to emulate the non-linear behavior in larger networks. Our system is highly efficient in terms of training time and computational and hardware requirements, allowing us to uncover distinct behaviors in neural codecs. We propose a modification to stabilize training with the straight-through estimator based on our findings. We validate our findings against an internal neural audio codec and against the state-of-the-art descript-audio-codec.

Title: MedMimic: Physician-Inspired Multimodal Fusion for Early Diagnosis of Fever of Unknown Origin
Authors: Minrui Chen, Yi Zhou, Huidong Jiang, Yuhan Zhu, Guanjie Zou, Minqi Chen, Rong Tian, Hiroto Saigo
Abstract: Fever of unknown origin FUO remains a diagnostic challenge. MedMimic is introduced as a multimodal framework inspired by real-world diagnostic processes. It uses pretrained models such as DINOv2, Vision Transformer, and ResNet-18 to convert high-dimensional 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging into low-dimensional, semantically meaningful features. A learnable self-attention-based fusion network then integrates these imaging features with clinical data for classification. Using 416 FUO patient cases from Sichuan University West China Hospital from 2017 to 2023, the multimodal fusion classification network MFCN achieved macro-AUROC scores ranging from 0.8654 to 0.9291 across seven tasks, outperforming conventional machine learning and single-modality deep learning methods. Ablation studies and five-fold cross-validation further validated its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of pretrained large models and deep learning, MedMimic offers a promising solution for disease classification.

Title: DULRTC-RME: A Deep Unrolled Low-rank Tensor Completion Network for Radio Map Estimation
Authors: Yao Wang, Xin Wu, Lianming Xu, Na Liu, Li Wang
Abstract: Radio maps enrich radio propagation and spectrum occupancy information, which provides fundamental support for the operation and optimization of wireless communication systems. Traditional radio maps are mainly achieved by extensive manual channel measurements, which is time-consuming and inefficient. To reduce the complexity of channel measurements, radio map estimation (RME) through novel artificial intelligence techniques has emerged to attain higher resolution radio maps from sparse measurements or few observations. However, black box problems and strong dependency on training data make learning-based methods less explainable, while model-based methods offer strong theoretical grounding but perform inferior to the learning-based methods. In this paper, we develop a deep unrolled low-rank tensor completion network (DULRTC-RME) for radio map estimation, which integrates theoretical interpretability and learning ability by unrolling the tedious low-rank tensor completion optimization into a deep network. It is the first time that algorithm unrolling technology has been used in the RME field. Experimental results demonstrate that DULRTC-RME outperforms existing RME methods.

Title: The Wideband Analysis of the Impact of I/Q Imbalance on THz Communication
Authors: Dogus Can Sevdiren, Aydin Sezgin, Mohammad Soleymani
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band is a promising solution to the increasing data traffic demands of future wireless networks. However, developing transceivers for THz communication is a complex and toilsome task due to the difficulty in designing devices that operate at this frequency and the impact of hardware impairments on performance. This paper investigates the impact of radio frequency (RF) impairment, in-phase/quadrature imbalance (IQI). To this end, we express an IQI model for the THzspecific array-of-subarrays (AoSA) architecture considering the unique features of THz communication; vast bandwidth, severe power drawdown, and pencil-like beams. We further model the impact of IQI in the power limited regime in order to investigate the power and ultra-wideband trade-off. To achieve this, we express the spectral efficiency in terms of wideband slope and bit energy to noise ratio which are the two important information theoretic metrics that reveals the performance of the ultrawideband systems as in THz communication. Our results show that THz systems with IQI have a strict limit in achievable rate although they provide immense spectrum. We also demonstrate with our simulation results that compared to low frequencies, IQI is a more serious concern in THz links.

Title: UAV-Based Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Joint Placement and Power Optimization under Fronthaul Capacity Limitations
Authors: Neetu R.R, Ozan Alp Topal, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson, Cicek Cavdar, Gourab Ghatak, Vivek Ashok Bohara
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple antennas serve as distributed UAV-access points (UAV-APs). These UAV-APs provide seamless coverage by jointly serving user equipments (UEs) with out predefined cell boundaries. However, high-capacity wireless networks face significant challenges due to fronthaul limitations in UAV-assisted architectures. This letter proposes a novel UAV-based cell-free mMIMO framework that leverages distributed UAV-APs to serve UEs while addressing the capacity constraints of wireless fronthaul links. We evaluate functional split Options 7.2 and 8 for the fronthaul links, aiming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the UEs and minimize the power consumption by optimizing the transmit powers of UAV-APs and selectively activating them. Our analysis compares sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for the fronthaul, showing that mmWave achieves superior SINR with lower power consumption, particularly under Option 8. Additionally, we determine the minimum fronthaul bandwidth required to activate a single UAV-AP under different split options.

Title: Terahertz Integrated Sensing and Communication-Empowered UAVs in 6G: A Transceiver Design Perspective
Authors: Ruoyu Zhang, Wen Wu, Xiaoming Chen, Zhen Gao, Yueming Cai
Abstract: Due to their high maneuverability, flexible deployment, and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a pivotal role in not only communication, but also sensing. Especially by exploiting the ultra-wide bandwidth of terahertz (THz) bands, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-empowered UAV has been a promising technology of 6G space-air-ground integrated networks. In this article, we systematically investigate the key techniques and essential obstacles for THz-ISAC-empowered UAV from a transceiver design perspective, with the highlight of its major challenges and key technologies. Specifically, we discuss the THz-ISAC-UAV wireless propagation environment, based on which several channel characteristics for communication and sensing are revealed. We point out the transceiver payload design peculiarities for THz-ISAC-UAV from the perspective of antenna design, radio frequency front-end, and baseband signal processing. To deal with the specificities faced by the payload, we shed light on three key technologies, i.e., hybrid beamforming for ultra-massive MIMO-ISAC, power-efficient THz-ISAC waveform design, as well as communication and sensing channel state information acquisition, and extensively elaborate their concepts and key issues. More importantly, future research directions and associated open problems are presented, which may unleash the full potential of THz-ISAC-UAV for 6G wireless networks.

Title: ARTInp: CBCT-to-CT Image Inpainting and Image Translation in Radiotherapy
Authors: Ricardo Coimbra Brioso, Leonardo Crespi, Andrea Seghetto, Damiano Dei, Nicola Lambri, Pietro Mancosu, Marta Scorsetti, Daniele Loiacono
Abstract: A key step in Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) workflows is the evaluation of the patient's anatomy at treatment time to ensure the accuracy of the delivery. To this end, Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) is widely used being cost-effective and easy to integrate into the treatment process. Nonetheless, CBCT images have lower resolution and more artifacts than CT scans, making them less reliable for precise treatment validation. Moreover, in complex treatments such as Total Marrow and Lymph Node Irradiation (TMLI), where full-body visualization of the patient is critical for accurate dose delivery, the CBCT images are often discontinuous, leaving gaps that could contain relevant anatomical information. To address these limitations, we propose ARTInp (Adaptive Radiation Therapy Inpainting), a novel deep-learning framework combining image inpainting and CBCT-to-CT translation. ARTInp employs a dual-network approach: a completion network that fills anatomical gaps in CBCT volumes and a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate high-quality synthetic CT (sCT) images. We trained ARTInp on a dataset of paired CBCT and CT images from the SynthRad 2023 challenge, and the performance achieved on a test set of 18 patients demonstrates its potential for enhancing CBCT-based workflows in radiotherapy.

Title: Wavelet-Assisted Multi-Frequency Attention Network for Pansharpening
Authors: Jie Huang, Rui Huang, Jinghao Xu, Siran Pen, Yule Duan, Liangjian Deng
Abstract: Pansharpening aims to combine a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to produce a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. Although pansharpening in the frequency domain offers clear advantages, most existing methods either continue to operate solely in the spatial domain or fail to fully exploit the benefits of the frequency domain. To address this issue, we innovatively propose Multi-Frequency Fusion Attention (MFFA), which leverages wavelet transforms to cleanly separate frequencies and enable lossless reconstruction across different frequency domains. Then, we generate Frequency-Query, Spatial-Key, and Fusion-Value based on the physical meanings represented by different features, which enables a more effective capture of specific information in the frequency domain. Additionally, we focus on the preservation of frequency features across different operations. On a broader level, our network employs a wavelet pyramid to progressively fuse information across multiple scales. Compared to previous frequency domain approaches, our network better prevents confusion and loss of different frequency features during the fusion process. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches and shows significant generalization capabilities for real-world scenarios.

Title: Joint Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems with Hybrid-Colluding Eavesdroppers
Authors: Meiding Liu, Zhengchun Zhou, Qiao Shi, Guyue Li, Zilong Liu, Pingzhi Fan, Inkyu Lee
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the physical layer security (PLS) problem for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the presence of hybrid-colluding eavesdroppers, where an active eavesdropper (AE) and a passive eavesdropper (PE) collude to intercept the confidential information. To ensure the accuracy of sensing while preventing the eavesdropping, a base station transmits a signal consisting of information symbols and sensing waveform, in which the sensing waveform can be also used as artificial noise to interfere with eavesdroppers. Under this setup, we propose an alternating optimization-based two stage scheme (AO-TSS) for improving the sensing and communication performance. In the first stage, based on the assumptions that the perfect channel state information (CSI) of the AE and statistical CSI of the PE are known, the communication and sensing beamforming problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the beampattern matching mean squared error (MSE) and cross-correlation, subject to the secure transmission constraint. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithm and a reduced-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm. Then, the scenarios are further extended to more general cases with imperfect AE CSI and unknown PE CSI. To further improve the communication performance, the second-stage problem is developed to optimize the secrecy rate threshold under the radar performance constraint. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of sensing and secure communication.

Title: Explainable and externally validated machine learning for neuropsychiatric diagnosis via electrocardiograms
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Ebenezer Oloyede, David Taylor, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has emerged as a promising tool for identifying physiological changes associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. The relationship between cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric disorders suggests that ECG abnormalities could serve as valuable biomarkers for more efficient detection, therapy monitoring, and risk stratification. However, the potential of the ECG to accurately distinguish neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly among diverse patient populations, remains underexplored. This study utilized ECG markers and basic demographic data to predict neuropsychiatric conditions using machine learning models, with targets defined through ICD-10 codes. Both internal and external validation were performed using the MIMIC-IV and ECG-View datasets respectively. Performance was assessed using AUROC scores. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley values were applied to provide insights into the contributions of individual ECG features to the predictions. Significant predictive performance was observed for conditions within the neurological and psychiatric groups. For the neurological group, Alzheimer's disease (G30) achieved an internal AUROC of 0.813 (0.812-0.814) and an external AUROC of 0.868 (0.867-0.868). In the psychiatric group, unspecified dementia (F03) showed an internal AUROC of 0.849 (0.848-0.849) and an external AUROC of 0.862 (0.861-0.863). Discriminative features align with known ECG markers but also provide hints on potentially new markers. ECG offers significant promise for diagnosing and monitoring neuropsychiatric conditions, with robust predictive performance across internal and external cohorts. Future work should focus on addressing potential confounders, such as therapy-related cardiotoxicity, and expanding the scope of ECG applications, including personalized care and early intervention strategies.

Title: Convergent NMPC-based Reinforcement Learning Using Deep Expected Sarsa and Nonlinear Temporal Difference Learning
Authors: Amine Salaje, Thomas Chevet, Nicolas Langlois
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) using an original reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn the optimal weights of the NMPC scheme. The controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Furthermore, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with parametrized NMPC as function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.

Title: Towards Smarter Sensing: 2D Clutter Mitigation in RL-Driven Cognitive MIMO Radar
Authors: Adam Umra, Aya Mostafa Ahmed, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in integrated sensing and communication for 6th generation (6G) networks, this paper presents a cognitive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar system enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) for robust multitarget detection in dynamic environments. The system employs a planar array configuration and adapts its transmitted waveforms and beamforming patterns to optimize detection performance in the presence of unknown two-dimensional (2D) disturbances. A robust Wald-type detector is integrated with a SARSA-based RL algorithm, enabling the radar to learn and adapt to complex clutter environments modeled by a 2D autoregressive process. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in detection probability compared to omnidirectional methods, particularly for low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) targets masked by clutter.

Title: CMamba: Learned Image Compression with State Space Models
Authors: Zhuojie Wu, Heming Du, Shuyun Wang, Ming Lu, Haiyang Sun, Yandong Guo, Xin Yu
Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has explored various architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, in modeling image content distributions in order to achieve compression effectiveness. However, achieving high rate-distortion performance while maintaining low computational complexity (\ie, parameters, FLOPs, and latency) remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Convolution and State Space Models (SSMs) based image compression framework, termed \textit{CMamba}, to achieve superior rate-distortion performance with low computational complexity. Specifically, CMamba introduces two key components: a Content-Adaptive SSM (CA-SSM) module and a Context-Aware Entropy (CAE) module. First, we observed that SSMs excel in modeling overall content but tend to lose high-frequency details. In contrast, CNNs are proficient at capturing local details. Motivated by this, we propose the CA-SSM module that can dynamically fuse global content extracted by SSM blocks and local details captured by CNN blocks in both encoding and decoding stages. As a result, important image content is well preserved during compression. Second, our proposed CAE module is designed to reduce spatial and channel redundancies in latent representations after encoding. Specifically, our CAE leverages SSMs to parameterize the spatial content in latent representations. Benefiting from SSMs, CAE significantly improves spatial compression efficiency while reducing spatial content redundancies. Moreover, along the channel dimension, CAE reduces inter-channel redundancies of latent representations via an autoregressive manner, which can fully exploit prior knowledge from previous channels without sacrificing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that CMamba achieves superior rate-distortion performance.

Title: C2GM: Cascading Conditional Generation of Multi-scale Maps from Remote Sensing Images Constrained by Geographic Features
Authors: Chenxing Sun, Yongyang Xu, Xuwei Xu, Xixi Fan, Jing Bai, Xiechun Lu, Zhanlong Chen
Abstract: Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.

Title: Output-Feedback Full-State Targeting Model Predictive Control for Station-Keeping on Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits
Authors: Yuri Shimane, Stefano Di Cairano, Koki Ho, Avishai Weiss
Abstract: We develop a model predictive control (MPC) policy for station-keeping (SK) on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed policy achieves full-state tracking of a reference NRHO via a two-maneuver control horizon placed one revolution apart. Our method abides by the typical mission requirement that at most one maneuver is used for SK during each NRHO revolution. Simultaneously, the policy has sufficient controllability for full-state tracking, making it immune to phase deviation issues in the along-track direction of the reference NRHO, a common drawback of existing SK methods with a single maneuver per revolution. We report numerical simulations with a navigation filter to demonstrate the MPC's performance with output feedback. Our approach successfully maintains the spacecraft's motion in the vicinity of the reference in both space and phase, with tighter tracking than state-of-the-art SK methods and comparable delta-V performance.

Title: Impact of Model Mismatch on DOA Estimation with MUSIC: Near-Field and Far-Field
Authors: Don-Roberts Emenonye, Harpreet S. Dhillon, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: There has been substantial work on developing variants of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithms that take advantage of the information present in the near-field propagation regime. However, it is not always easy to determine the correct propagation regime, which opens the possibility of incorrectly applying simpler algorithms (meant for far-field) in the near-field regime. Inspired by this, we use simulation results to investigate the performance drop when there is a mismatch between the signal model in the MUSIC algorithm and the propagation regime. For direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, we consider the cases when the receiver is in the near-field region but uses i) the near-field model, ii) the approximate near-field model (ANM) model, and iii) the far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. We also consider the case when the receiver is in the far-field region, and we use the correct far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. One contribution is that in the near-field, we have quantified the loss in performance when the ANM and the far-field model are used to create the beamforming matrix for the MUSIC algorithm, causing a reduction in estimation accuracy compared to the case when the correct near-field model is used to design the beamforming matrix. Another result is that in the near-field, when we incorrectly assume that the receiver is in the far-field and subsequently use the far-field beamforming matrix, we underestimate the DOA estimation error. Finally, we show that the MUSIC algorithm can provide very accurate range estimates for distances less than the Fraunhofer distance. This estimate gradually becomes inaccurate as the distances exceed the Fraunhofer distance.

Title: Investigating the impact of kernel harmonization and deformable registration on inspiratory and expiratory chest CT images for people with COPD
Authors: Aravind R. Krishnan, Yihao Liu, Kaiwen Xu, Michael E. Kim, Lucas W. Remedios, Gaurav Rudravaram, Adam M. Saunders, Bradley W. Richmond, Kim L. Sandler, Fabien Maldonado, Bennett A. Landman, Lianrui Zuo
Abstract: Paired inspiratory-expiratory CT scans enable the quantification of gas trapping due to small airway disease and emphysema by analyzing lung tissue motion in COPD patients. Deformable image registration of these scans assesses regional lung volumetric changes. However, variations in reconstruction kernels between paired scans introduce errors in quantitative analysis. This work proposes a two-stage pipeline to harmonize reconstruction kernels and perform deformable image registration using data acquired from the COPDGene study. We use a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to harmonize inspiratory scans reconstructed with a hard kernel (BONE) to match expiratory scans reconstructed with a soft kernel (STANDARD). We then deformably register the expiratory scans to inspiratory scans. We validate harmonization by measuring emphysema using a publicly available segmentation algorithm before and after harmonization. Results show harmonization significantly reduces emphysema measurement inconsistencies, decreasing median emphysema scores from 10.479% to 3.039%, with a reference median score of 1.305% from the STANDARD kernel as the target. Registration accuracy is evaluated via Dice overlap between emphysema regions on inspiratory, expiratory, and deformed images. The Dice coefficient between inspiratory emphysema masks and deformably registered emphysema masks increases significantly across registration stages (p<0.001). Additionally, we demonstrate that deformable registration is robust to kernel variations.

Title: Fixed-Throughput GRAND with FIFO Scheduling
Authors: Filippo Christen, Darja Nonaca, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is a code-agnostic decoding method that iteratively guesses the noise pattern affecting the received codeword. The number of noise sequences to test depends on the noise realization. Thus, GRAND exhibits random runtime which results in nondeterministic throughput. However, real-time systems must process the incoming data at a fixed rate, necessitating a fixed-throughput decoder in order to avoid losing data. We propose a first-in first-out (FIFO) scheduling architecture that enables a fixed throughput while improving the block error rate (BLER) compared to the common approach of imposing a maximum runtime constraint per received codeword. Moreover, we demonstrate that the average throughput metric of GRAND-based hardware implementations typically provided in the literature can be misleading as one needs to operate at approximately one order of magnitude lower throughput to achieve the BLER of an unconstrained decoder.

Title: Chest X-ray Foundation Model with Global and Local Representations Integration
Authors: Zefan Yang, Xuanang Xu, Jiajin Zhang, Ge Wang, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Pingkun Yan
Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most frequently ordered imaging test, supporting diverse clinical tasks from thoracic disease detection to postoperative monitoring. However, task-specific classification models are limited in scope, require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a self-supervised vision foundation model that learns robust CXR representations and generalizes effectively across a wide range of downstream tasks. We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40 disease findings across different prevalence levels on the CXR-LT 24 dataset and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular disease risk estimation and mortality prediction. These results highlight CheXFound's strong generalization capabilities, enabling diverse adaptations with improved label efficiency. The project source code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: HSI: A Holistic Style Injector for Arbitrary Style Transfer
Authors: Shuhao Zhang, Hui Kang, Yang Liu, Fang Mei, Hongjuan Li
Abstract: Attention-based arbitrary style transfer methods have gained significant attention recently due to their impressive ability to synthesize style details. However, the point-wise matching within the attention mechanism may overly focus on local patterns such that neglect the remarkable global features of style images. Additionally, when processing large images, the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism will bring high computational load. To alleviate above problems, we propose Holistic Style Injector (HSI), a novel attention-style transformation module to deliver artistic expression of target style. Specifically, HSI performs stylization only based on global style representation that is more in line with the characteristics of style transfer, to avoid generating local disharmonious patterns in stylized images. Moreover, we propose a dual relation learning mechanism inside the HSI to dynamically render images by leveraging semantic similarity in content and style, ensuring the stylized images preserve the original content and improve style fidelity. Note that the proposed HSI achieves linear computational complexity because it establishes feature mapping through element-wise multiplication rather than matrix multiplication. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Authors: Bo Wen, Xin Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents SOLOMON, a novel Neuro-inspired Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning Network architecture that enhances the adaptability of foundation models for domain-specific applications. Through a case study in semiconductor layout design, we demonstrate how SOLOMON enables swift adaptation of general-purpose LLMs to specialized tasks by leveraging Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning techniques. Our experiments reveal the challenges LLMs face in spatial reasoning and applying domain knowledge to practical problems. Results show that SOLOMON instances significantly outperform their baseline LLM counterparts and achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art reasoning model, o1-preview. We discuss future research directions for developing more adaptive AI systems that can continually learn, adapt, and evolve in response to new information and changing requirements.

Authors: Bokeng Zheng, Bo Rao, Tianxiang Zhu, Chee Wei Tan, Jingpu Duan, Zhi Zhou, Xu Chen, Xiaoxi Zhang
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs), are increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the evolution of urban this http URL, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model this http URL overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.

Title: FocalCodec: Low-Bitrate Speech Coding via Focal Modulation Networks
Authors: Luca Della Libera, Francesco Paissan, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli
Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling.

Title: Iterative Importance Fine-tuning of Diffusion Models
Authors: Alexander Denker, Shreyas Padhy, Francisco Vargas, Johannes Hertrich
Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using the $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by estimating the $h$-transform, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the $h$-transform using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.

Title: ADIFF: Explaining audio difference using natural language
Authors: Soham Deshmukh, Shuo Han, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj
Abstract: Understanding and explaining differences between audio recordings is crucial for fields like audio forensics, quality assessment, and audio generation. This involves identifying and describing audio events, acoustic scenes, signal characteristics, and their emotional impact on listeners. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively study the task of explaining audio differences and then propose benchmark, baselines for the task. First, we present two new datasets for audio difference explanation derived from the AudioCaps and Clotho audio captioning datasets. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate three levels of difference explanations: (1) concise descriptions of audio events and objects, (2) brief sentences about audio events, acoustic scenes, and signal properties, and (3) comprehensive explanations that include semantics and listener emotions. For the baseline, we use prefix tuning where audio embeddings from two audio files are used to prompt a frozen language model. Our empirical analysis and ablation studies reveal that the naive baseline struggles to distinguish perceptually similar sounds and generate detailed tier 3 explanations. To address these limitations, we propose ADIFF, which introduces a cross-projection module, position captioning, and a three-step training process to enhance the model's ability to produce detailed explanations. We evaluate our model using objective metrics and human evaluation and show our model enhancements lead to significant improvements in performance over naive baseline and SoTA Audio-Language Model (ALM) Qwen Audio. Lastly, we conduct multiple ablation studies to study the effects of cross-projection, language model parameters, position captioning, third stage fine-tuning, and present our findings. Our benchmarks, findings, and strong baseline pave the way for nuanced and human-like explanations of audio differences.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer relies on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for segmentation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). Manual segmentation of these volumes is regarded as the gold standard for ground truth in machine learning applications but to acquire such data is tedious and time-consuming. A publicly available clinical dataset is presented, comprising MRI- and synthetic CT (sCT) images, target and OARs segmentations, and radiotherapy dose distributions for 432 prostate cancer patients treated with MRI-guided radiotherapy. An extended dataset with 35 patients is also included, with the addition of deep learning (DL)-generated segmentations, DL segmentation uncertainty maps, and DL segmentations manually adjusted by four radiation oncologists. The publication of these resources aims to aid research within the fields of automated radiotherapy treatment planning, segmentation, inter-observer analyses, and DL model uncertainty investigation. The dataset is hosted on the AIDA Data Hub and offers a free-to-use resource for the scientific community, valuable for the advancement of medical imaging and prostate cancer radiotherapy research.

Title: ImprovNet: Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinement
Authors: Keshav Bhandari, Sungkyun Chang, Tongyu Lu, Fareza R. Enus, Louis B. Bradshaw, Dorien Herremans, Simon Colton
Abstract: Deep learning has enabled remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, offering new possibilities for creative content generation. However, in the realm of symbolic music, generating controllable and expressive performance-level style transfers for complete musical works remains challenging due to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations.

Title: The Mini Wheelbot: A Testbed for Learning-based Balancing, Flips, and Articulated Driving
Authors: Henrik Hose, Jan Weisgerber, Sebastian Trimpe
Abstract: The Mini Wheelbot is a balancing, reaction wheel unicycle robot designed as a testbed for learning-based control. It is an unstable system with highly nonlinear yaw dynamics, non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in a small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot can use its wheels to stand up from any initial orientation - enabling automatic environment resets in repetitive experiments and even challenging half flips. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Mini Wheelbot as a testbed by implementing two popular learning-based control algorithms. First, we showcase Bayesian optimization for tuning the balancing controller. Second, we use imitation learning from an expert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic effects to reorient the robot and can track higher-level velocity and orientation commands. The latter allows the robot to drive around based on user commands - for the first time in this class of robots. The Mini Wheelbot is not only compelling for testing learning-based control algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with, as demonstrated in the video of our experiments.

Title: Force interaction, modeling and soft tissue deformation during reciprocating insertion of multi-part probe
Authors: Tassanai Parittotokkaporn, Matthew Oldfield, Luca Frasson, Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena
Abstract: The bio-inspired engineering of ovipositing wasps, which employ a reciprocating motion for soft tissue insertion, offers potential advantages in reducing insertion force and minimizing tissue damage. However, the underlying mechanisms of tissue interaction and sparing are not fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate a multi-part probe designed to mimic the reciprocating motion of ovipositors. A reciprocal insertion model was developed to study the interaction between the probe and soft tissue, and experimental testing was conducted using a force sensor and laser optical technique to gain insights into interacting forces and tissue deformation. The results reveal that during the cutting phase of reciprocal motion, the peak force and average displacement of the soft substrate were approximately 19% and 20% lower, respectively, compared to direct insertion at an overall probe velocity of 1 mm/s. This study presents a novel approach combining mechanical modeling and experimental analysis to explore the force mechanics of the reciprocating insertion method, providing a better understanding of the interaction between the probe and soft tissue.

Title: Adversarially-Robust TD Learning with Markovian Data: Finite-Time Rates and Fundamental Limits
Authors: Sreejeet Maity, Aritra Mitra
Abstract: One of the most basic problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is policy evaluation: estimating the long-term return, i.e., value function, corresponding to a given fixed policy. The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated finite-time convergence guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof. However, these guarantees hinge on the reward observations being always generated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian) true reward distribution. Motivated by harsh, real-world environments where such an idealistic assumption may no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem from the perspective of adversarial robustness. In particular, we consider a Huber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each reward sample with a small probability $\epsilon$. Under this observation model, we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to converge to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm called Robust-TD and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of vanilla TD with linear function approximation up to a small $O(\epsilon)$ term that captures the effect of corruption. We complement this result with a minimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive corruption-induced term is unavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the first of their kind in the context of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation schemes driven by Markov noise. The key new technical tool that enables our results is an analysis of the Median-of-Means estimator with corrupted, time-correlated data that might be of independent interest to the literature on robust statistics.

Title: Be Water, My Antennas: Riding on Radio Wave Fluctuation in Nature for Spatial Multiplexing using Programmable Meta-Fluid Antenna
Authors: Baiyang Liu, Kin-Fai Tong, Kai-Kit Wong, Chan-Byoung Chae, Hang Wong
Abstract: Interference and scattering, often deemed undesirable, are inevitable in wireless communications, especially when the current mobile networks and upcoming sixth generation (6G) have turned into ultra-dense networks. Current approaches relying on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combined with artificial-intelligence-aided (AI) signal processing have drawbacks of being power-hungry and requiring wide bandwidth that raise scalability concerns. In this article, we take a radical approach and utilize the channel fading phenomenon to our advantage. Specifically, we propose a novel meta-fluid antenna architecture, referred to as the `fluid' antenna system (FAS), that can freely surf on radio wave fluctuations, like `fluid' figuratively speaking, with fine resolution in space to opportunistically avoid interference, eliminating the need for expensive signal processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that under rich scattering conditions, the proposed meta-fluidic architecture is able to exploit the natural ups and downs of radio waves in space for spatial multiplexing. These breakthrough results show that scattering can be desirable not harmful and interference can be dodged not suppressed, fundamentally changing our perception of fading and our understanding on how interference should be managed in wireless communications networks.

Title: Dynamic Frequency-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Xihao Yuan, Siqi Liu, Hanting Chen, Lu Zhou, Jian Li, Jie Hu
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement (SE) models have recently outperformed traditional techniques, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high computational and memory demands. This paper introduces a novel dynamic frequency-adaptive knowledge distillation (DFKD) approach to effectively compress SE models. Our method dynamically assesses the model's output, distinguishing between high and low-frequency components, and adapts the learning objectives to meet the unique requirements of different frequency bands, capitalizing on the SE task's inherent characteristics. To evaluate the DFKD's efficacy, we conducted experiments on three state-of-the-art models: DCCRN, ConTasNet, and DPTNet. The results demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances the performance of the compressed model (student model) but also surpasses other logit-based knowledge distillation methods specifically for SE tasks.

Title: Singing Voice Conversion with Accompaniment Using Self-Supervised Representation-Based Melody Features
Authors: Wei Chen, Binzhu Sha, Jing Yang, Zhuo Wang, Fan Fan, Zhiyong Wu
Abstract: Melody preservation is crucial in singing voice conversion (SVC). However, in many scenarios, audio is often accompanied with background music (BGM), which can cause audio distortion and interfere with the extraction of melody and other key features, significantly degrading SVC performance. Previous methods have attempted to address this by using more robust neural network-based melody extractors, but their performance drops sharply in the presence of complex accompaniment. Other approaches involve performing source separation before conversion, but this often introduces noticeable artifacts, leading to a significant drop in conversion quality and increasing the user's operational costs. To address these issues, we introduce a novel SVC method that uses self-supervised representation-based melody features to improve melody modeling accuracy in the presence of BGM. In our experiments, we compare the effectiveness of different self-supervised learning (SSL) models for melody extraction and explore for the first time how SSL benefits the task of melody extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SVC model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of melody accuracy and shows higher similarity and naturalness in both subjective and objective evaluations across noisy and clean audio environments.

Title: Uplink Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Mobile Edge Computing with Short-Packet Communications
Authors: Jiawei Xu, Yumeng Zhang, Yunnuo Xu, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: In this paper, a Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) scheme is proposed to assist a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system where local computation tasks from two users are offloaded to the MEC server, facilitated by uplink RSMA for processing. The efficiency of the MEC service is hence primarily influenced by the RSMA-aided task offloading phase and the subsequent task computation phase, where reliable and low-latency communication is required. For this practical consideration, short-packet communication in the Finite Blocklength (FBL) regime is introduced. In this context, we propose a novel uplink RSMA-aided MEC framework and derive the overall Successful Computation Probability (SCP) with FBL consideration. To maximize the SCP of our proposed RSMA-aided MEC, we strategically optimize: (1) the task offloading factor which determines the number of tasks to be offloaded and processed by the MEC server; (2) the transmit power allocation between different RSMA streams; and (3) the task-splitting factor which decides how many tasks are allocated to splitting streams, while adhering to FBL constraints. To address the strong coupling between these variables in the SCP expression, we apply the Alternative Optimization method, which formulates tractable subproblems to optimize each variable iteratively. The resultant non-convex subproblems are then tackled by Successive Convex Approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that applying uplink RSMA in the MEC system with FBL constraints can not only improve the SCP performance but also provide lower latency in comparison to conventional transmission scheme such as Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA).

Title: Quantum Supremacy in Tomographic Imaging: Advances in Quantum Tomography Algorithms
Authors: Hyunju Lee, Kyungtaek Jun
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm, capable of tackling complex computational problems that are infeasible for classical methods within a practical timeframe. At the core of this advancement lies the concept of quantum supremacy, which signifies the ability of quantum processors to surpass classical systems in specific tasks. In the context of tomographic image reconstruction, quantum optimization algorithms enable faster processing and clearer imaging than conventional methods. This study further substantiates quantum supremacy by reducing the required projection angles for tomographic reconstruction while enhancing robustness against image artifacts. Notably, our experiments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm accurately reconstructed tomographic images without artifacts, even when up to 50% error was introduced into the sinogram to induce ring artifacts. Furthermore, it achieved precise reconstructions using only 50% of the projection angles from the original sinogram spanning 0° to 180°. These findings highlight the potential of quantum algorithms to revolutionize tomographic imaging by enabling efficient and accurate reconstructions under challenging conditions, paving the way for broader applications in medical imaging, material science, and advanced tomography systems as quantum computing technologies continue to advance.

Title: Online Robot Motion Planning Methodology Guided by Group Social Proxemics Feature
Authors: Xuan Mu, Xiaorui Liu, Shuai Guo, Wenzheng Chi, Wei Wang, Shuzhi Sam Ge
Abstract: Nowadays robot is supposed to demonstrate human-like perception, reasoning and behavior pattern in social or service application. However, most of the existing motion planning methods are incompatible with above requirement. A potential reason is that the existing navigation algorithms usually intend to treat people as another kind of obstacle, and hardly take the social principle or awareness into consideration. In this paper, we attempt to model the proxemics of group and blend it into the scenario perception and navigation of robot. For this purpose, a group clustering method considering both social relevance and spatial confidence is introduced. It can enable robot to identify individuals and divide them into groups. Next, we propose defining the individual proxemics within magnetic dipole model, and further established the group proxemics and scenario map through vector-field superposition. On the basis of the group clustering and proxemics modeling, we present the method to obtain the optimal observation positions (OOPs) of group. Once the OOPs grid and scenario map are established, a heuristic path is employed to generate path that guide robot cruising among the groups for interactive purpose. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the proposed methodology on the practical robot, the results have demonstrated that our methodology has achieved promising performance on group recognition accuracy and path-generation efficiency. This concludes that the group awareness evolved as an important module to make robot socially behave in the practical scenario.

Title: The Role of Integrity Monitoring in Connected and Automated Vehicles: Current State-of-Practice and Future Directions
Authors: Saswat Priyadarshi Nayak, Matthew Barth
Abstract: Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) research has gained traction in the last decade due to significant advancements in perception, navigation, communication, and control functions. Accurate and reliable position information is needed to meet the requirements of CAV applications, especially when safety is concerned. With the advent of various perception sensors (e.g. camera, LiDAR, etc.), the vehicular positioning system has improved both in accuracy and robustness. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based cooperative positioning can improve the accuracy of the position estimates, but the integrity risks involved in multi-sensor fusion in a cooperative environment have not yet been fully explored. This paper reviews existing research in the field of positioning Integrity Monitoring (IM) and identifies various research gaps. Particular attention has been placed on identifying research that highlights cooperative IM methods. This analysis helps pave the way for the development of new IM frameworks for cooperative positioning solutions in the future.

Title: Evaluating Standard and Dialectal Frisian ASR: Multilingual Fine-tuning and Language Identification for Improved Low-resource Performance
Authors: Reihaneh Amooie, Wietse de Vries, Yun Hao, Jelske Dijkstra, Matt Coler, Martijn Wieling
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance for low-resource languages is still far behind that of higher-resource languages such as English, due to a lack of sufficient labeled data. State-of-the-art methods deploy self-supervised transfer learning where a model pre-trained on large amounts of data is fine-tuned using little labeled data in a target low-resource language. In this paper, we present and examine a method for fine-tuning an SSL-based model in order to improve the performance for Frisian and its regional dialects (Clay Frisian, Wood Frisian, and South Frisian). We show that Frisian ASR performance can be improved by using multilingual (Frisian, Dutch, English and German) fine-tuning data and an auxiliary language identification task. In addition, our findings show that performance on dialectal speech suffers substantially, and, importantly, that this effect is moderated by the elicitation approach used to collect the dialectal data. Our findings also particularly suggest that relying solely on standard language data for ASR evaluation may underestimate real-world performance, particularly in languages with substantial dialectal variation.

Title: Deep Learning Models for Physical Layer Communications
Authors: Nunzio A. Letizia
Abstract: The increased availability of data and computing resources has enabled researchers to successfully adopt machine learning (ML) techniques and make significant contributions in several engineering areas. ML and in particular deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown to perform better in tasks where a physical bottom-up description of the phenomenon is lacking and/or is mathematically intractable. Indeed, they take advantage of the observations of natural phenomena to automatically acquire knowledge and learn internal relations. Despite the historical model-based mindset, communications engineering recently started shifting the focus towards top-down data-driven learning models, especially in domains such as channel modeling and physical layer design, where in most of the cases no general optimal strategies are known. In this thesis, we aim at solving some fundamental open challenges in physical layer communications exploiting new DL paradigms. In particular, we mathematically formulate, under ML terms, classic problems such as channel capacity and optimal coding-decoding schemes, for any arbitrary communication medium. We design and develop the architecture, algorithm and code necessary to train the equivalent DL model, and finally, we propose novel solutions to long-standing problems in the field.

Title: A New Paradigm in Tuning Learned Indexes: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Approach
Authors: Taiyi Wang, Liang Liang, Guang Yang, Thomas Heinis, Eiko Yoneki
Abstract: Learned Index Structures (LIS) have significantly advanced data management by leveraging machine learning models to optimize data indexing. However, designing these structures often involves critical trade-offs, making it challenging for both designers and end-users to find an optimal balance tailored to specific workloads and scenarios. While some indexes offer adjustable parameters that demand intensive manual tuning, others rely on fixed configurations based on heuristic auto-tuners or expert knowledge, which may not consistently deliver optimal performance. This paper introduces LITune, a novel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures. LITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To accommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance LITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These innovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online tuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and workloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in runtime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter settings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight LITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS in real-world applications.

Title: Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters
Authors: Simon Donker van Heel, Rutger-Jan Lange, Dick van Dijk, Bram van Os
Abstract: We consider the problem of tracking latent time-varying parameter vectors under model misspecification. We analyze implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update a prediction of the parameters using the gradient of the logarithmic observation density (i.e., the score). In the ESD filter, the score is computed using the predicted parameter values, whereas in the ISD filter, the score is evaluated using the new, updated parameter values. For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions for the exponential stability (i.e., invertibility) of the filtered parameter path and existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound with respect to the pseudo-true parameter path. In addition, we present expressions for finite-sample and asymptotic MSE bounds. Our performance guarantees rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability result is entirely agnostic about the true process. As a result, our primary conditions depend only on the characteristics of the filter; hence, they are verifiable in practice. Concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient (but not necessary) for ISD-filter stability, whereas ESD-filter stability additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous. Extensive simulation studies validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the enhanced stability and improved performance of ISD over ESD filters. An empirical application to U.S. Treasury-bill rates confirms the practical relevance of our contribution.

Title: Optimizing Wireless Resource Management and Synchronization in Digital Twin Networks
Authors: Hanzhi Yu, Yuchen Liu, Zhaohui Yang, Haijian Sun, Mingzhe Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an accurate synchronization between a physical network and its digital network twin (DNT), which serves as a virtual representation of the physical network. The considered network includes a set of base stations (BSs) that must allocate its limited spectrum resources to serve a set of users while also transmitting its partially observed physical network information to a cloud server to generate the DNT. Since the DNT can predict the physical network status based on its historical status, the BSs may not need to send their physical network information at each time slot, allowing them to conserve spectrum resources to serve the users. However, if the DNT does not receive the physical network information of the BSs over a large time period, the DNT's accuracy in representing the physical network may degrade. To this end, each BS must decide when to send the physical network information to the cloud server to update the DNT, while also determining the spectrum resource allocation policy for both DNT synchronization and serving the users. We formulate this resource allocation task as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the total data rate of all users while minimizing the asynchronization between the physical network and the DNT. To address this problem, we propose a method based on the GRUs and the value decomposition network (VDN). Simulation results show that our GRU and VDN based algorithm improves the weighted sum of data rates and the similarity between the status of the DNT and the physical network by up to 28.96%, compared to a baseline method combining GRU with the independent Q learning.

Title: Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for Long-Form Audio Generation
Authors: Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao
Abstract: Previous work on long-form audio generation using global-view diffusion or iterative generation demands significant training or inference costs. While recent advancements in multi-view joint diffusion for panoramic generation provide an efficient option, they struggle with spectrum generation with severe overlap distortions and high cross-view consistency costs. We initially explore this phenomenon through the connectivity inheritance of latent maps and uncover that averaging operations excessively smooth the high-frequency components of the latent map. To address these issues, we propose Swap Forward (SaFa), a frame-level latent swap framework that synchronizes multiple diffusions to produce a globally coherent long audio with more spectrum details in a forward-only manner. At its core, the bidirectional Self-Loop Latent Swap is applied between adjacent views, leveraging stepwise diffusion trajectory to adaptively enhance high-frequency components without disrupting low-frequency components. Furthermore, to ensure cross-view consistency, the unidirectional Reference-Guided Latent Swap is applied between the reference and the non-overlap regions of each subview during the early stages, providing centralized trajectory guidance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based long audio generation models. Moreover, we find that it also adapts well to panoramic generation, achieving comparable state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency and model generalizability.

Title: Meta Audiobox Aesthetics: Unified Automatic Quality Assessment for Speech, Music, and Sound
Authors: Andros Tjandra, Yi-Chiao Wu, Baishan Guo, John Hoffman, Brian Ellis, Apoorv Vyas, Bowen Shi, Sanyuan Chen, Matt Le, Nick Zacharov, Carleigh Wood, Ann Lee, Wei-Ning Hsu
Abstract: The quantification of audio aesthetics remains a complex challenge in audio processing, primarily due to its subjective nature, which is influenced by human perception and cultural context. Traditional methods often depend on human listeners for evaluation, leading to inconsistencies and high resource demands. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of predicting audio aesthetics without human intervention. Such systems are crucial for applications like data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets, and evaluating generative audio models, especially as these models become more sophisticated. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to audio aesthetic evaluation by proposing new annotation guidelines that decompose human listening perspectives into four distinct axes. We develop and train no-reference, per-item prediction models that offer a more nuanced assessment of audio quality. Our models are evaluated against human mean opinion scores (MOS) and existing methods, demonstrating comparable or superior performance. This research not only advances the field of audio aesthetics but also provides open-source models and datasets to facilitate future work and benchmarking. We release our code and pre-trained model at: this https URL

Title: A Modular System Architecture for an Offshore Off-grid Platform for Climate neutral Power-to-X Production in H2Mare
Authors: Pascal Häbig, Daniel Dittler, Maximilian Fey, Timo Müller, Nikola Mößner, Nasser Jazdi, Michael Weyrich, Kai Hufendiek
Abstract: Power-to-X (PtX) products constitute a promising solution component in the defossilisation of hard-to-abate sectors. Where direct electrification is not possible, they can find application as chemical feedstock, easy to transport energy carriers and storage. In this contribution, a modular system architecture for a highly automated operation of an offshore off-grid PtX production platform consisting of five layers (asset, control, communication, digital, application) is presented. The assumed advantage of such an off-grid platform is the good scalability worldwide as well as easy exploitation of renewable potentials in any location. Using the example of a power-to-methanol process, a simplified prototype is outlined.

Title: UAV Formation and Resource Allocation Optimization for Communication-Assisted 3D InSAR Sensing
Authors: Mohamed-Amine Lahmeri, Víctor Mustieles-Pérez, Martin Vossiek, Gerhard Krieger, Robert Schober
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate joint unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation and resource allocation optimization for communication-assisted three-dimensional (3D) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing. We consider a system consisting of two UAVs that perform bistatic interferometric SAR (InSAR) sensing for generation of a digital elevation model (DEM) and transmit the radar raw data to a ground station (GS) in real time. To account for practical 3D sensing requirements, we use non-conventional sensing performance metrics, such as the SAR interferometric coherence, i.e., the local cross-correlation between the two co-registered UAV SAR images, the point-to-point InSAR relative height error, and the height of ambiguity, which together characterize the accuracy with which the InSAR system can determine the height of ground targets. Our objective is to jointly optimize the UAV formation, speed, and communication power allocation for maximization of the InSAR coverage while satisfying energy, communication, and InSAR-specific sensing constraints. To solve the formulated non-smooth and non-convex optimization problem, we divide it into three sub-problems and propose a novel alternating optimization (AO) framework that is based on classical, monotonic, and stochastic optimization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive simulations and compared to several benchmark schemes. Furthermore, our simulation results highlight the impact of the UAV-GS communication link on the flying formation and sensing performance and show that the DEM of a large area of interest can be mapped and offloaded to ground successfully, while the ground topography can be estimated with centimeter-scale precision. Lastly, we demonstrate that a low UAV velocity is preferable for InSAR applications as it leads to better sensing accuracy.

Title: SACNet: A Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network for 2D Multi-organ Medical Segmentation
Authors: Lin Zhang, Wenbo Gao, Jie Yi, Yunyun Yang
Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation in medical image analysis is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many factors complicate the task, including variability in different target categories and interference from complex backgrounds. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge of Deformable Convolution V3 (DCNv3) and multi-object segmentation to optimize our Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network (SACNet) in three aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, and loss constraint, simultaneously enhancing the perception of different segmentation targets. Firstly, we propose the Adaptive Receptive Field Module (ARFM), which combines DCNv3 with a series of customized block-level and architecture-level designs similar to transformers. This module can capture the unique features of different organs by adaptively adjusting the receptive field according to various targets. Secondly, we utilize ARFM as building blocks to construct the encoder-decoder of SACNet and partially share parameters between the encoder and decoder, making the network wider rather than deeper. This design achieves a shared lightweight decoder and a more parameter-efficient and effective framework. Lastly, we propose a novel continuity dynamic adjustment loss function, based on t-vMF dice loss and cross-entropy loss, to better balance easy and complex classes in segmentation. Experiments on 3D slice datasets from ACDC and Synapse demonstrate that SACNet delivers superior segmentation performance in multi-organ segmentation tasks compared to several existing methods.

Title: GLAM: Glomeruli Segmentation for Human Pathological Lesions using Adapted Mouse Model
Authors: Lining Yu, Mengmeng Yin, Ruining Deng, Quan Liu, Tianyuan Yao, Can Cui, Yitian Long, Yu Wang, Yaohong Wang, Shilin Zhao, Haichun Yang, Yuankai Huo
Abstract: Moving from animal models to human applications in preclinical research encompasses a broad spectrum of disciplines in medical science. A fundamental element in the development of new drugs, treatments, diagnostic methods, and in deepening our understanding of disease processes is the accurate measurement of kidney tissues. Past studies have demonstrated the viability of translating glomeruli segmentation techniques from mouse models to human applications. Yet, these investigations tend to neglect the complexities involved in segmenting pathological glomeruli affected by different lesions. Such lesions present a wider range of morphological variations compared to healthy glomerular tissue, which are arguably more valuable than normal glomeruli in clinical practice. Furthermore, data on lesions from animal models can be more readily scaled up from disease models and whole kidney biopsies. This brings up a question: ``\textit{Can a pathological segmentation model trained on mouse models be effectively applied to human patients?}" To answer this question, we introduced GLAM, a deep learning study for fine-grained segmentation of human kidney lesions using a mouse model, addressing mouse-to-human transfer learning, by evaluating different learning strategies for segmenting human pathological lesions using zero-shot transfer learning and hybrid learning by leveraging mouse samples. From the results, the hybrid learning model achieved superior performance.

Title: multiGradICON: A Foundation Model for Multimodal Medical Image Registration
Authors: Basar Demir, Lin Tian, Thomas Hastings Greer, Roland Kwitt, Francois-Xavier Vialard, Raul San Jose Estepar, Sylvain Bouix, Richard Jarrett Rushmore, Ebrahim Ebrahim, Marc Niethammer
Abstract: Modern medical image registration approaches predict deformations using deep networks. These approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration accuracy and are generally fast. However, deep learning (DL) approaches are, in contrast to conventional non-deep-learning-based approaches, anatomy-specific. Recently, a universal deep registration approach, uniGradICON, has been proposed. However, uniGradICON focuses on monomodal image registration. In this work, we therefore develop multiGradICON as a first step towards universal *multimodal* medical image registration. Specifically, we show that 1) we can train a DL registration model that is suitable for monomodal *and* multimodal registration; 2) loss function randomization can increase multimodal registration accuracy; and 3) training a model with multimodal data helps multimodal generalization. Our code and the multiGradICON model are available at this https URL.

Title: Assessment of Cell Nuclei AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology

Abstract: Cell nuclei instance segmentation is a crucial task in digital kidney pathology. Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.

Title: Prescribed-time Convergent Distributed Multiobjective Optimization with Dynamic Event-triggered Communication
Authors: Tengyang Gong, Zhongguo Li, Yiqiao Xu, Zhengtao Ding
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed constrained multiobjective resource allocation problems (DCMRAPs) within multi-agent networks, where each agent has multiple, potentially conflicting local objectives, constrained by both local and global constraints. By reformulating the DCMRAP as a single-objective weighted $L_p$ problem, a distributed solution is enabled, which eliminates the need for predetermined weighting factors or centralized decision-making in traditional methods. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), novel distributed algorithms are proposed to achieve Pareto optimality within a prescribed settling time through sampled communication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), these algorithms provide more flexibility in optimizing accuracy and control smoothness without the constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs are designed to work with generalized TBGs to promote communication efficiency, which adjusts to both local error metrics and network-based disagreements. The Zeno behavior is excluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulations, our method demonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, advancing distributed optimization in complex environments.

Title: Degrees of Freedom of Holographic MIMO in Multi-user Near-field Channels
Authors: Houfeng Chen, Shaohua Yue, Marco Di Renzo, Hongliang Zhang
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is an emerging technology for 6G communications, in which numerous antenna units are integrated in a limited space. As the HMIMO array aperture expands, the near-field region of the array is dramatically enlarged, resulting in more users being located in the near-field region. This creates new opportunities for wireless communications. In this context, the evaluation of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) of HMIMO multi-user systems in near-field channels is an open problem, as the analytical methods utilized for evaluating the DoF in far-field channels cannnot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a novel method to calculate the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels. We first derive the DoF for a single user in the near field, and then extend the analysis to multi-user scenarios. In this latter scenario, we focus on the impact of spatial blocking between HMIMO users. The derived analytical framework reveals that the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels is not in general given by the sum of the DoF of the HMIMO single-user setting because of spatial blocking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the considered setup, the DoF may be reduced by 6.7 dB on average due to spatial blocking.

Title: Nature-inspired dynamic control for pursuit-evasion of robots
Authors: Panpan Zhou, Sirui Li, Benyun Zhao, Bo Wahlberg, Xiaoming Hu
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion problem is widespread in nature, engineering, and societal applications. It is commonly observed in nature that predators often exhibit faster speeds than their prey but have less agile maneuverability. Over millions of years of evolution, animals have developed effective and efficient strategies for both pursuit and evasion. In this paper, we provide a dynamic framework for the pursuit-evasion problem of unicycle systems, drawing inspiration from nature. First, we address the scenario involving one pursuer and one evader by proposing an Alert-Turn control strategy, which consists of two efficient ingredients: a sudden turning maneuver and an alert condition for starting and maintaining the maneuver. We present and analyze the escape and capture results at two levels: a lower level of a single run and a higher level with respect to parameters' changes. In addition, we provide a theorem with sufficient conditions for capture. The Alert-Turn strategy is then extended to more complex scenarios involving multiple pursuers and evaders by integrating aggregation control laws and a target-changing mechanism. By adjusting a 'selfish parameter', the aggregation control commands produce various escape patterns of evaders: cooperative mode, selfish mode, as well as their combinations. The influence of the selfish parameter is quantified, and the effects of the number of pursuers and the target-changing mechanism are explored from a statistical perspective. Our findings align closely with observations in nature. Finally, the proposed control strategies are validated through numerical simulations that replicate some chasing behaviors of animals in nature.

Title: Enhancing Multimodal Medical Image Classification using Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning
Authors: Jun-En Ding, Chien-Chin Hsu, Chi-Hsiang Chu, Shuqiang Wang, Feng Liu
Abstract: The classification of medical images is a pivotal aspect of disease diagnosis, often enhanced by deep learning techniques. However, traditional approaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting the integration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal structured data from different data domains to improve medical image classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-image data by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learning to align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modality feature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process by reducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a public melanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventional unimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction. Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanoma classification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medical image classification while offering improved disease interpretability and predictive capabilities.

Title: Exploring the Use of Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles for Supporting Power Grid Operations
Authors: Yuqi Zhou, Cong Feng, Mingzhi Zhang, Rui Yang
Abstract: This paper explores the use of autonomous unmanned vehicles to support power grid operations. With built-in batteries and the capability to carry additional battery energy storage, the rising number of autonomous vehicles can represent a substantial amount of capacity that is currently underutilized in the power grid. Unlike traditional electric vehicles that require drivers, the operations of autonomous vehicles can be performed without human intervention. To guide idle vehicles to autonomously support power grids, we propose a tractable optimization-based method to effectively integrate these "mobile batteries" into grid operations. During real-time operations, the vehicles are strategically routed to target locations to maintain power balance and reduce operating costs. Numerical studies have confirmed both the validity and the scalability of the proposed algorithm to efficiently integrate autonomous vehicles into routine power system operations.

Title: ScAlN-on-SiC Ku-Band Solidly-Mounted Bidimensional Mode Resonators
Authors: Luca Colombo, Luca Spagnuolo, Kapil Saha, Gabriel Giribaldi, Pietro Simeoni, Matteo Rinaldi
Abstract: This letter reports on Solidly-Mounted Bidimensional Mode Resonators (S2MRs) exploiting a highly-optimized Sezawa mode in 30% Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) and operating near 16 GHz. Experimental results demonstrate mechanical quality factors (Qm) as high as 380, Bode quality factors (QBode) approaching 500, electromechanical coupling coefficients (kt2) of 4.5%, an overall Figure of Merit (FOM = Qm kt2) exceeding 17, and power handling greater than 20 dBm for devices closely matched to 50 ohms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, S2MRs exhibit the highest Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) among solidly mounted resonators in the Ku band, paving the way for the integration of nanoacoustic devices on fast substrates with high-power electronics, tailored for military and harsh-environment applications.

Title: Hilbert Transform on Graphs: Let There Be Phase
Authors: Chun Hei Michael Chan, Alexandre Cionca, Dimitri Van De Ville
Abstract: In the past years, many signal processing operations have been successfully adapted to the graph setting. One elegant and effective approach is to exploit the eigendecomposition of a graph shift operator (GSO), such as the adjacency or Laplacian operator, to define a graph Fourier transform when projecting graph signals on the corresponding basis. However, the extension of this scheme to directed graphs is challenging since the associated GSO is non-symmetric and, in general, not diagonalizable. Here, we build upon a recent framework that adds a minimal number of edges to allow diagonalization of the GSO and thus provide a proper graph Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that such minimal addition of edges creates a cycle cover and that it is essential for the phase analysis of a signal throughout the graph. Concurrently, we propose a generalization of the Hilbert transform interpreted over the newfound cycle cover, which re-establishes intuitions from traditional Hilbert Transform, equivalent to the generalized Hilbert Transform on a single cycle. This generalization leads to a number of simple and elegant recipes to effectively exploit the phase information of graph signals provided by the graph Fourier transform. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on several examples.

Title: Spectral-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation for Speaker Verification
Authors: Zhe Li, Man-wai Mak, Mert Pilanci, Hung-yi Lee, Helen Meng
Abstract: Previous research has shown that the principal singular vectors of a pre-trained model's weight matrices capture critical knowledge. In contrast, those associated with small singular values may contain noise or less reliable information. As a result, the LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach, which does not constrain the use of the spectral space, may not be effective for tasks that demand high representation capacity. In this study, we enhance existing PEFT techniques by incorporating the spectral information of pre-trained weight matrices into the fine-tuning process. We investigate spectral adaptation strategies with a particular focus on the additive adjustment of top singular vectors. This is accomplished by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the pre-trained weight matrices and restricting the fine-tuning within the top spectral space. Extensive speaker verification experiments on VoxCeleb1 and CN-Celeb1 demonstrate enhanced tuning performance with the proposed approach. Code is released at this https URL.

Title: LLM4WM: Adapting LLM for Wireless Multi-Tasking
Authors: Xuanyu Liu, Shijian Gao, Boxun Liu, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: The wireless channel is fundamental to communication, encompassing numerous tasks collectively referred to as channel-associated tasks. These tasks can leverage joint learning based on channel characteristics to share representations and enhance system design. To capitalize on this advantage, LLM4WM is proposed--a large language model (LLM) multi-task fine-tuning framework specifically tailored for channel-associated tasks. This framework utilizes a Mixture of Experts with Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) approach for multi-task fine-tuning, enabling the transfer of the pre-trained LLM's general knowledge to these tasks. Given the unique characteristics of wireless channel data, preprocessing modules, adapter modules, and multi-task output layers are designed to align the channel data with the LLM's semantic feature space. Experiments on a channel-associated multi-task dataset demonstrate that LLM4WM outperforms existing methodologies in both full-sample and few-shot evaluations, owing to its robust multi-task joint modeling and transfer learning capabilities.

Title: Crystal Oscillators in OSNMA-Enabled Receivers: An Implementation View for Automotive Applications
Authors: Francesco Ardizzon, Nicola Laurenti, Carlo Sarto, Giovanni Gamba, Cillian O'Driscoll, Ignacio Fernandez-Hernandez
Abstract: To ensure the authenticity of navigation data, Galileo Open Service navigation message authentication (OSNMA) requires loose synchronization between the receiver clock and the system time. This means that during the period between clock calibrations, the receiver clock error needs to be smaller than a pre-defined threshold, currently up to 165s for OSNMA. On the other hand, relying on the PVT solution to steer the receiver clock or correct its bias may not be possible since this would depend on the very same signals we intend to authenticate. This work aims to investigate the causes of the frequency accuracy loss leading to clock errors and to build a model that, from the datasheet of a real-time clock (RTC) device, allows to bound the error clock during a certain period. The model's main contributors are temperature changes, long-term aging, and offset at calibration, but it includes other factors. We then apply the model to several RTCs from different manufacturers and bound the maximum error for certain periods, with a focus on the two-year between-calibration period expected for the smart tachograph, an automotive application that will integrate OSNMA.

Title: A Dynamic Similarity Index for Assessing Voltage Source Behaviour in Power Systems
Authors: Onur Alican, Dionysios Moutevelis, Josep Arevalo-Soler, Carlos Collados-Rodriguez, Jaume Amorós, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt, Marc Cheah-Mane, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo
Abstract: Due to the fundamental transition to a power electronic dominated power system, the increasing diversity of dynamic elements underscores the need to assess their similarity to mature electrical engineering models. This article addresses the concept of the Dynamic Similarity Index (DSI) for its use in, power electronics-dominated networks. The DSI is a multipurpose tool developed to be used by different stakeholders (e.g., converter manufacturers and system operators). Such an index is calculated per frequency, which serves to anticipate potential differences in particular frequency ranges of interest between the model under study and the reference model. Within the scope of this study, the dynamic similarity of inverter-based generators to an ideal voltage source behind an impedance is assessed, due to the relevance of this fundamental circuit in the representation of generation units in power system studies. The article presents two potential applications based on this mathematical framework. First, for manufacturers to evaluate control performance compared to a reference model and second, it enables operators to diagnose buses with voltage vulnerability based on a user-defined reference Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR) value. The DSI results for these two case studies are validated using Matlab Simulink simulations.

Title: A Hodge-FAST Framework for High-Resolution Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis of Higher Order Interactions in EEG Signals
Authors: Om Roy, Yashar Moshfeghi, Jason Smith, Agustin Ibanez, Mario A.Parra, Keith M. Smith
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Hodge decomposition with Filtered Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity to analyze dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in EEG signals. This method leverages graph-based topology and simplicial analysis to explore transient connectivity patterns at multiple scales, addressing noise, sparsity, and computational efficiency. The temporal EEG data are first sparsified by keeping only the most globally important connections, instantaneous connectivity at these connections is then filtered by global long-term stable correlations. This tensor is then decomposed into three orthogonal components to study signal flows over higher-order structures such as triangle and loop structures. Our analysis of Alzheimer-related MCI patients show significant temporal differences related to higher-order interactions that a pairwise analysis on its own does not implicate. This allows us for the first time to capture higher-dimensional interactions at high temporal resolution in noisy EEG signal recordings.

Title: C codegen considered unnecessary: go directly to binary, do not pass C. Compilation of Julia code for deployment in model-based engineering
Authors: Fredrik Bagge Carlson, Cody Tapscott, Gabriel Baraldi, Chris Rackauckas
Abstract: Since time immemorial an old adage has always seemed to ring true: you cannot use a high-level productive programming language like Python or R for real-time control and embedded-systems programming, you must rewrite your program in C. We present a counterexample to this mantra by demonstrating how recent compiler developments in the Julia programming language allow users of Julia and the equation-based modeling language ModelingToolkit to compile and deploy binaries for real-time model-based estimation and control. Contrary to the approach taken by a majority of modeling and simulation tools, we do not generate C code, and instead demonstrate how we may use the native Julia code-generation pipeline through LLVM to compile architecture-specific binaries from high-level code. This approach avoids many of the restrictions typically placed on high-level languages to enable C-code generation. As case studies, we include a nonlinear state estimator derived from an equation-based model which is compiled into a program that performs state estimation for deployment onto a Raspberry Pi, as well as a PID controller library implemented in Julia and compiled into a shared library callable from a C program.

Title: Optimal No-Fly Zone Design for the Coexistence of Drone and Satellite Networks
Authors: Xiangliu Tu, Chiranjib Saha, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Abstract: Constructing a no-fly zone (NFZ) is a straightforward and effective way to facilitate the coexistence of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and existing systems (typically satellite systems). However, there has been little work on understanding the optimal design of such NFZs. In the absence of this design, one invariably ends up overestimating this region, hence significantly limiting the allowed airspace for the drones. To optimize the volume of the NFZ, we formulate this task as a variational problem and utilize the calculus of variations to rigorously obtain the NFZ as a function of the antenna pattern of victim receivers and the spatial distribution of drones. This approach parallels the matched filter design in the sense that the NFZ extends in directions where the antenna gain and/or the density of drones is high. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimal design compared to the known baselines in reducing the volume of the NFZ without compromising the protective performance.

Title: SLCGC: A lightweight Self-supervised Low-pass Contrastive Graph Clustering Network for Hyperspectral Images
Authors: Yao Ding, Zhili Zhang, Aitao Yang, Yaoming Cai, Xiongwu Xiao, Danfeng Hong, Junsong Yuan
Abstract: Self-supervised hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the absence of labeled data and the inherent complexity of spatial-spectral interactions. While recent advancements have explored innovative approaches, existing methods face critical limitations in clustering accuracy, feature discriminability, computational efficiency, and robustness to noise, hindering their practical deployment. In this paper, a self-supervised efficient low-pass contrastive graph clustering (SLCGC) is introduced for HSIs. Our approach begins with homogeneous region generation, which aggregates pixels into spectrally consistent regions to preserve local spatial-spectral coherence while drastically reducing graph complexity. We then construct a structural graph using an adjacency matrix A and introduce a low-pass graph denoising mechanism to suppress high-frequency noise in the graph topology, ensuring stable feature propagation. A dual-branch graph contrastive learning module is developed, where Gaussian noise perturbations generate augmented views through two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and a cross-view contrastive loss enforces structural consistency between views to learn noise-invariant representations. Finally, latent embeddings optimized by this process are clustered via K-means. Extensive experiments and repeated comparative analysis have verified that our SLCGC contains high clustering accuracy, low computational complexity, and strong robustness.

Title: Comprehensive Layer-wise Analysis of SSL Models for Audio Deepfake Detection
Authors: Yassine El Kheir, Youness Samih, Suraj Maharjan, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian Möller
Abstract: This paper conducts a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for audio deepfake detection across diverse contexts, including multilingual datasets (English, Chinese, Spanish), partial, song, and scene-based deepfake scenarios. By systematically evaluating the contributions of different transformer layers, we uncover critical insights into model behavior and performance. Our findings reveal that lower layers consistently provide the most discriminative features, while higher layers capture less relevant information. Notably, all models achieve competitive equal error rate (EER) scores even when employing a reduced number of layers. This indicates that we can reduce computational costs and increase the inference speed of detecting deepfakes by utilizing only a few lower layers. This work enhances our understanding of SSL models in deepfake detection, offering valuable insights applicable across varied linguistic and contextual settings. Our trained models and code are publicly available: this https URL.

Authors: Yi Ding, Joon Hei Lee, Shuailei Zhang, Tianze Luo, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Learning the spatial topology of electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and their temporal dynamics is crucial for decoding attention states. This paper introduces EEG-PatchFormer, a transformer-based deep learning framework designed specifically for EEG attention classification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. By integrating a Temporal CNN for frequency-based EEG feature extraction, a pointwise CNN for feature enhancement, and Spatial and Temporal Patching modules for organizing features into spatial-temporal patches, EEG-PatchFormer jointly learns spatial-temporal information from EEG data. Leveraging the global learning capabilities of the self-attention mechanism, it captures essential features across brain regions over time, thereby enhancing EEG data decoding performance. Demonstrating superior performance, EEG-PatchFormer surpasses existing benchmarks in accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and macro-F1 score on a public cognitive attention dataset.

Title: Towards Explainable Spoofed Speech Attribution and Detection:a Probabilistic Approach for Characterizing Speech Synthesizer Components
Authors: Jagabandhu Mishra, Manasi Chhibber, Hye-jin Shim, Tomi H. Kinnunen
Abstract: We propose an explainable probabilistic framework for characterizing spoofed speech by decomposing it into probabilistic attribute embeddings. Unlike raw high-dimensional countermeasure embeddings, which lack interpretability, the proposed probabilistic attribute embeddings aim to detect specific speech synthesizer components, represented through high-level attributes and their corresponding values. We use these probabilistic embeddings with four classifier back-ends to address two downstream tasks: spoofing detection and spoofing attack attribution. The former is the well-known bonafide-spoof detection task, whereas the latter seeks to identify the source method (generator) of a spoofed utterance. We additionally use Shapley values, a widely used technique in machine learning, to quantify the relative contribution of each attribute value to the decision-making process in each task. Results on the ASVspoof2019 dataset demonstrate the substantial role of duration and conversion modeling in spoofing detection; and waveform generation and speaker modeling in spoofing attack attribution. In the detection task, the probabilistic attribute embeddings achieve $99.7\%$ balanced accuracy and $0.22\%$ equal error rate (EER), closely matching the performance of raw embeddings ($99.9\%$ balanced accuracy and $0.22\%$ EER). Similarly, in the attribution task, our embeddings achieve $90.23\%$ balanced accuracy and $2.07\%$ EER, compared to $90.16\%$ and $2.11\%$ with raw embeddings. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework is both inherently explainable by design and capable of achieving performance comparable to raw CM embeddings.

Title: Terahertz Defect Detection in Multi-Layer Materials Using Echo Labeling
Authors: Dogus Can Sevdiren, Furkan H. Ilgac, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.

Title: Copula Density Neural Estimation
Authors: Nunzio A. Letizia, Andrea M. Tonello
Abstract: Probability density estimation from observed data constitutes a central task in statistics. Recent advancements in machine learning offer new tools but also pose new challenges. The big data era demands analysis of long-range spatial and long-term temporal dependencies in large collections of raw data, rendering neural networks an attractive solution for density estimation. In this paper, we exploit the concept of copula to explicitly build an estimate of the probability density function associated to any observed data. In particular, we separate univariate marginal distributions from the joint dependence structure in the data, the copula itself, and we model the latter with a neural network-based method referred to as copula density neural estimation (CODINE). Results show that the novel learning approach is capable of modeling complex distributions and it can be applied for mutual information estimation and data generation.

Title: RISnet: A Domain-Knowledge Driven Neural Network Architecture for RIS Optimization with Mutual Coupling and Partial CSI
Authors: Bile Peng, Karl-Ludwig Besser, Shanpu Shen, Finn Siegismund-Poschmann, Ramprasad Raghunath, Daniel Mittleman, Vahid Jamali, Eduard A. Jorswieck
Abstract: Space-division multiple access (SDMA) plays an important role in modern wireless communications. Its performance depends on the channel properties, which can be improved by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this work, we jointly optimize SDMA precoding at the base station (BS) and RIS configuration. We tackle difficulties of mutual coupling between RIS elements, scalability to more than 1000 RIS elements, and high requirement for channel estimation. We first derive an RIS-assisted channel model considering mutual coupling, then propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) approach to optimize the RIS with a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet, which has good scalability, desired permutation-invariance, and a low requirement for channel estimation. Moreover, we leverage existing high-performance analytical precoding scheme to propose a hybrid solution of ML-enabled RIS configuration and analytical precoding at BS. More generally, this work is an early contribution to combine ML technique and domain knowledge in communication for NN architecture design. Compared to generic ML, the problem-specific ML can achieve higher performance, lower complexity and permutation-invariance.

Title: Multi-Scale Frequency-Enhanced Deep D-bar Method for Electrical Impedance Tomography
Authors: Xiang Cao, Qiaoqiao Ding, Xiaoqun Zhang
Abstract: The regularized D-bar method is a popular method for solving Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) problems due to its efficiency and simplicity. It utilizes the low-pass truncated scattering data in the non-linear Fourier domain to solve the associated D-bar integral equations, yielding a smooth conductivity approximation. However, the D-bar reconstruction often presents low contrast and resolution due to the absence of accurate high-frequency information and the ill-posedness of the problem. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based supervised approach for real-time EIT reconstruction. Based on the D-bar method, we propose to utilize both multi-scale frequency enhancement and spatial consistency for a high image quality reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a fixed-point iteration for solving discrete D-bar systems on GPUs for fast computation. Numerical results are performed for both the continuum model and complete electrode model simulation on KIT4 and ACT4 datasets to demonstrate notable improvements in absolute EIT imaging quality.

Title: Distributed Signal Processing for Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array Systems: State-of-the-Art and Future Directions
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Erik G. Larsson, Eduard A. Jorswieck, Xiao Li, Shi Jin, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) play a critical role in enabling the functionalities of next generation wireless communication systems. However, as the number of antennas increases, ELAA systems face significant bottlenecks, such as excessive interconnection costs and high computational complexity. Efficient distributed signal processing (SP) algorithms show great promise in overcoming these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of distributed SP algorithms for ELAA systems, tailored to address these bottlenecks. We start by presenting three representative forms of ELAA systems: single-base station ELAA systems, coordinated distributed antenna systems, and ELAA systems integrated with emerging technologies. For each form, we review the associated distributed SP algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we outline several important future research directions that are essential for improving the performance and practicality of ELAA systems.

Title: The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions
Authors: Vincenzo Mottola, Antonio Corbo Esposito, Luisa Faella, Gianpaolo Piscitelli, Ravi Prakash, Antonello Tamburrino
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle states a monotonic relationship between a possibly non-linear material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator. The Monotonicity Principle (MP) has attracted great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Together with the introduction of a MP and a related imaging method to treat the inverse obstacle problem in the presence of nonlinear anomalies, arose a set of fundamental questions regarding the performances of the method in the presence of noise. The main contribution of this work is focused on theoretical aspects and consists in proving that (i) the imaging method is stable and robust with respect to the noise, (ii) the reconstruction approaches monotonically to a well-defined limit, as the noise level approaches to zero, and that (iii) the limit contains the unknown set and is contained in the outer boundary of the unknown set. Results (i) and (ii) come directly from the Monotonicity Principle, while results (iii) requires to prove the so-called Converse of the Monotonicity Principle, a theoretical results of fundamental relevance to evaluate the ideal (noise-free) performances of the imaging method. The results are provided in a quite general setting for Calderón problem, and proved for three wide classes where the nonlinearity of the anomaly can be either bounded from infinity and zero, or bounded from zero only, or bounded by infinity only. These classes of constitutive relationships cover the wide majority of cases encountered in applications. To be concrete, the PDE considered in this study is the one that governs Electrical Resistance Tomography.

Title: VoiceTextBlender: Augmenting Large Language Models with Speech Capabilities via Single-Stage Joint Speech-Text Supervised Fine-Tuning
Authors: Yifan Peng, Krishna C. Puvvada, Zhehuai Chen, Piotr Zelasko, He Huang, Kunal Dhawan, Ke Hu, Shinji Watanabe, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Recent studies have augmented large language models (LLMs) with speech capabilities, leading to the development of speech language models (SpeechLMs). Earlier SpeechLMs focused on single-turn speech-based question answering (QA), where user input comprised a speech context and a text question. More recent studies have extended this to multi-turn conversations, though they often require complex, multi-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with diverse data. Another critical challenge with SpeechLMs is catastrophic forgetting, where models optimized for speech tasks suffer significant degradation in text-only performance. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel single-stage joint speech-text SFT approach on the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of the LLM backbone. Our joint SFT combines text-only SFT data with three types of speech-related data: speech recognition and translation, speech-based QA, and mixed-modal SFT. Compared to previous SpeechLMs with 7B or 13B parameters, our 3B model demonstrates superior performance across various speech benchmarks while preserving the original capabilities on text-only tasks. Furthermore, our model shows emergent abilities of effectively handling previously unseen prompts and tasks, including multi-turn, mixed-modal inputs.

Title: Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments
Authors: Yu-Han Huang, Venugopal V. Veeravalli
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.

Title: Methods to Increase the Amount of Data for Speech Recognition for Low Resource Languages
Authors: Alexan Ayrapetyan, Sofia Kostandian, Ara Yeroyan, Mher Yerznkanyan, Nikolay Karpov, Nune Tadevosyan, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: This study explores methods to increase data volume for low-resource languages using techniques such as crowdsourcing, pseudo-labeling, advanced data preprocessing and various permissive data sources such as audiobooks, Common Voice, YouTube. While these methods are well-explored for highresource languages, their application for low-resource languages remains underexplored. Using Armenian and Georgian as case studies, we demonstrate how linguistic and resource-specific characteristics influence the success of these methods. This work provides practical guidance for researchers to choose cost-effective and quality-driven dataset extension strategies for low-resource languages. The key takeaway from various data extension approaches is that paid crowd-sourcing offers the best balance between cost and quality, outperforming volunteer crowd-sourcing, open-source audiobooks, and unlabeled data usage. Ablation study shows that models trained on the expanded datasets outperform existing baselines and achieve 5.73% for Gergian and 9.9% for Armenian ASR word error rate using a relatively small FastConformer architecture. We open-sourced both the Armenian and Georgian models to allow further research and practical applications.

Title: How to warm-start your unfolding network
Authors: Vicky Kouni
Abstract: We present a new ensemble framework for boosting the performance of overparameterized unfolding networks solving the compressed sensing problem. We combine a state-of-the-art overparameterized unfolding network with a continuation technique, to warm-start a crucial quantity of the said network's architecture; we coin the resulting continued network C-DEC. Moreover, for training and evaluating C-DEC, we incorporate the log-cosh loss function, which enjoys both linear and quadratic behavior. Finally, we numerically assess C-DEC's performance on real-world images. Results showcase that the combination of continuation with the overparameterized unfolded architecture, trained and evaluated with the chosen loss function, yields smoother loss landscapes and improved reconstruction and generalization performance of C-DEC, consistently for all datasets.
