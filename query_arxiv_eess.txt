Title: Distributed learning for automatic modulation recognition in bandwidth-limited networks
Authors: Narges Rashvand, Kenneth Witham, Gabriel Maldonado, Vinit Katariya, Aly Sultan, Gunar Schirner, Hamed Tabkhi
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques. However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around 41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers, the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach. These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of bandwidth-limited wireless networks.

Title: Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates
Authors: Sehyun Ryu, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.

Title: Ambient Backscatter Communication Assisted by Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Masoud Kaveh, Farshad Rostami Ghadi, Riku Jantti, Kai-Kit Wong, F. Javier Lopez-Martinez
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.

Title: Modelling Real-Life Cycling Decisions in Real Urban Settings Through Psychophysiology and LLM-Derived Contextual Data
Authors: Maximiliano Rosadio Z., Angel Jimenez-Molina, Bastián Henríquez, Paulina Leiva, Ricardo Hurtubia, Ricardo De La Paz Guala, Leandro Gayozo, C. Angelo Guevara
Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field. Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments. This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach, extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete, although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking, etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic conditions on cyclist behavior.

Title: Constructive Lyapunov Functions via Topology-Preserving Neural Networks
Authors: Jaehong Oh
Abstract: We prove that ONN achieves order-optimal performance on convergence rate ($\mu \propto \lambda_2$), edge efficiency ($E = N$ for minimal connectivity $k = 2$), and computational complexity ($O(N d^2)$). Empirical validation on 3M-node semantic networks demonstrates 99.75\% improvement over baseline methods, confirming exponential convergence ($\mu = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}$) and topology preservation. ORTSF integration into transformers achieves 14.7\% perplexity reduction and 2.3 faster convergence on WikiText-103. We establish deep connections to optimal control (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman), information geometry (Fisher-efficient natural gradient), topological data analysis (persistent homology computation in $O(KN)$), discrete geometry (Ricci flow), and category theory (adjoint functors). This work transforms Massera's abstract existence theorem into a concrete, scalable algorithm with provable guarantees, opening pathways for constructive stability analysis in neural networks, robotics, and distributed systems.

Title: Aerial RIS-Enhanced Communications: Joint UAV Trajectory, Altitude Control, and Phase Shift Design
Authors: Bin Li, Dongdong Yang, Lei Liu, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS), we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies. Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance, achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.

Title: Decoding non-invasive brain activity with novel deep-learning approaches
Authors: Richard Csaky
Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.

Title: Cardi-GPT: An Expert ECG-Record Processing Chatbot
Authors: Koustav Mallick, Neel Singh, Mohammedreza Hajiarbabi
Abstract: Interpreting and communicating electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are crucial yet challenging tasks in cardiovascular diagnosis, traditionally requiring significant expertise and precise clinical communication. This paper introduces Cardi-GPT, an advanced expert system designed to streamline ECG interpretation and enhance clinical communication through deep learning and natural language interaction. Cardi-GPT employs a 16-residual-block convolutional neural network (CNN) to process 12-lead ECG data, achieving a weighted accuracy of 0.6194 across 24 cardiac conditions. A novel fuzzification layer converts complex numerical outputs into clinically meaningful linguistic categories, while an integrated chatbot interface facilitates intuitive exploration of diagnostic insights and seamless communication between healthcare providers. The system was evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning six hospitals across four countries, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, Cardi-GPT achieved an impressive overall response quality score of 73\%, assessed using a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures coverage, grounding, and coherence. By bridging the gap between intricate ECG data interpretation and actionable clinical insights, Cardi-GPT represents a transformative innovation in cardiovascular healthcare, promising to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes across diverse medical settings.

Title: StrikeWatch: Wrist-worn Gait Recognition with Compact Time-series Models on Low-power FPGAs
Authors: Tianheng Ling, Chao Qian, Peter Zdankin, Torben Weis, Gregor Schiele
Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline, post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity. This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN, 1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized 1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just 0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub repository this https URL.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Data Augmentation for Clinical ECG Classification with STAR
Authors: Nader Nemati
Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii) source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware, stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus, thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are essential.

Title: PulseFi: A Low Cost Robust Machine Learning System for Accurate Cardiopulmonary and Apnea Monitoring Using Channel State Information
Authors: Pranay Kocheta, Nayan Sanjay Bhatia, Katia Obraczka
Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can be expensive and less accessible.

Title: EcoScaleNet: A Lightweight Multi Kernel Network for Long Sequence 12 lead ECG Classification
Authors: Dong-Hyeon Kang, Ju-Hyeon Nam, Sang-Chul Lee
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN) addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by 99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub Link.

Title: Opportunistic Screening of Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome using Single-Lead AI-ECG Mobile System: A Real-World Study of over 3.5 million ECG Recordings in China
Authors: Shun Huang, Deyun Zhang, Sumei Fan, Shijia Geng, Yujie Xiao, Rui Zhang, Zhaoji Fu, Shenda Hong
Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%. Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626 single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5% sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210 times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case, compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting population-based cardiovascular prevention.

Title: Principal and Combination Parametric Resonances of an Electromagnetically Suspended Vehicle subject to Base Excitation
Authors: Jithu Paul, Karel N. van Dalen, Andrei B. Faragau, Rens J. van Leijden, Biagio Carboni, Andrei V. Metrikine
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic stability of an electromagnetically suspended vehicle, encountered in Hyperloop and Maglev systems, subject to periodic excitations caused by surface irregularities or vibration of the support induced by external noise. The narrow clearance between the vehicle and the support can make it highly sensitive to small oscillations, since the admissible amplitudes of the vehicle oscillations can be comparable to external excitation amplitude. The vehicle is modelled as a three-degree-of-freedom model where the vehicle is suspended via two identical electromagnetic actuators from a rigid support that oscillates. The governing equations are derived using force and torque balances, incorporating nonlinear electromagnetic forces, and Kirchhoffs law for the electromagnets with PD control strategy on the airgap. The equations of motion are linearized around the steady state induced by the surface oscillation, yielding a system with time-periodic coefficients. We analytically explore both principal and combination parametric resonances using an extended Hills method, and Floquet theory is used for numerical validation. The stability boundaries are obtained as ellipses in control gain parameter space, and the influence of system parameters on these boundaries is characterized. For the principal parametric resonance, the ratio of the sizes of the two obtained ellipses is three to one, whereas for the combination parametric resonance, the ratio is fourteen to one. When all ellipses are simultaneously present, one of the ellipses associated with the combination parametric resonance is the largest.

Title: Stable-by-Design Neural Network-Based LPV State-Space Models for System Identification
Authors: Ahmet Eren Sertbaş, Tufan Kumbasar
Abstract: Accurate modeling of nonlinear systems is essential for reliable control, yet conventional identification methods often struggle to capture latent dynamics while maintaining stability. We propose a \textit{stable-by-design LPV neural network-based state-space} (NN-SS) model that simultaneously learns latent states and internal scheduling variables directly from data. The state-transition matrix, generated by a neural network using the learned scheduling variables, is guaranteed to be stable through a Schur-based parameterization. The architecture combines an encoder for initial state estimation with a state-space representer network that constructs the full set of scheduling-dependent system matrices. For training the NN-SS, we develop a framework that integrates multi-step prediction losses with a state-consistency regularization term, ensuring robustness against drift and improving long-horizon prediction accuracy. The proposed NN-SS is evaluated on benchmark nonlinear systems, and the results demonstrate that the model consistently matches or surpasses classical subspace identification methods and recent gradient-based approaches. These findings highlight the potential of stability-constrained neural LPV identification as a scalable and reliable framework for modeling complex nonlinear systems.

Title: A Digital Twin Framework for Decision-Support and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure in Localized Urban Systems
Authors: Linh Do-Bui-Khanh, Thanh H. Nguyen, Nghi Huynh Quang, Doanh Nguyen-Ngoc, Laurent El Ghaoui
Abstract: As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments, optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction, energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios. Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW) solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible, computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to city-wide urban contexts.

Title: DMVFC: Deep Learning Based Functionally Consistent Tractography Fiber Clustering Using Multimodal Diffusion MRI and Functional MRI
Authors: Bocheng Guo, Jin Wang, Yijie Li, Junyi Wang, Mingyu Gao, Puming Feng, Yuqian Chen, Jarrett Rushmore, Nikos Makris, Yogesh Rathi, Lauren J O'Donnell, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore, microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from each source of information separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

Title: CFL-SparseMed: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Medical Imaging with Top-k Sparse Updates
Authors: Gousia Habib, Aniket Bhardwaj, Ritvik Sharma, Shoeib Amin Banday, Ishfaq Ahmad Malik
Abstract: Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborations but struggles with heterogeneous, non-IID data and high communication costs, especially in large networks. We propose \textbf{CFL-SparseMed}, an FL approach that uses Top-k Sparsification to reduce communication overhead by transmitting only the top k gradients. This unified solution effectively addresses data heterogeneity while maintaining model accuracy. It enhances FL efficiency, preserves privacy, and improves diagnostic accuracy and patient care in non-IID medical imaging settings. The reproducibility source code is available on \href{this https URL}{Github}.

Title: Semantic Communications with World Models
Authors: Peiwen Jiang, Jiajia Guo, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin, Jun Zhang
Abstract: Semantic communication is a promising technique for emerging wireless applications, which reduces transmission overhead by transmitting only task-relevant features instead of raw data. However, existing methods struggle under extremely low bandwidth and varying channel conditions, where corrupted or missing semantics lead to severe reconstruction errors. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a world foundation model (WFM)-aided semantic video transmission framework that leverages the predictive capability of WFMs to generate future frames based on the current frame and textual guidance. This design allows transmissions to be omitted when predictions remain reliable, thereby saving bandwidth. Through WFM's prediction, the key semantics are preserved, yet minor prediction errors tend to amplify over time. To mitigate issue, a lightweight depth-based feedback module is introduced to determine whether transmission of the current frame is needed. Apart from transmitting the entire frame, a segmentation-assisted partial transmission method is proposed to repair degraded frames, which can further balance performance and bandwidth cost. Furthermore, an active transmission strategy is developed for mobile scenarios by exploiting camera trajectory information and proactively scheduling transmissions before channel quality deteriorates. Simulation results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces transmission overhead while maintaining task performances across varying scenarios and channel conditions.

Title: Decentralized Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles to Enhance Safety and Energy Efficiency using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shreshta Rajakumar Deshpande, Mrdjan Jankovic
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized Control Barrier Function (CBF) based approach for highway merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized controller compared to its centralized counterpart.

Title: A Cylindrical Nanowire Array-Based Flexure-FET Receiver for Molecular Communication
Authors: Dilara Aktas, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale communication and networking techniques with bio-cyber interfaces, ensuring energy-efficient, reliable, and low-complexity modulation and detection while maintaining biocompatibility. To address these challenges, the Flexure-FET MC receiver was introduced as a mechanically transducing design capable of detecting both charged and neutral molecular species. In this study, we present a cylindrical nanowire array-based Flexure-FET MC receiver that enhances design versatility and scalability through distributed electromechanical coupling in a suspended-gate configuration. The proposed array architecture offers additional geometric degrees of freedom, including nanowire radius, length, spacing, and array size, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to advanced MC scenarios. An analytical end-to-end model is developed to characterize the system's electromechanical response, noise behavior, and information-theoretic performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. The results reveal the strong interdependence between geometry, electromechanical dynamics, and molecular binding processes, enabling tunable control over sensitivity, noise characteristics, and communication capacity. The enhanced structural tunability and array configuration of the proposed design provide a flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver architectures within the IoNT framework.

Title: Delay Tolerant Control for Autonomous Driving Using CDOB
Authors: Xincheng Cao, Haochong Chen, Levent Guvenc, Bilin Aksun-Guvenc
Abstract: With the rapid growth of autonomous vehicle technologies, effective path-tracking control has become a critical component in ensuring safety and efficiency in complex traffic scenarios. When a high level decision making agent generates a collision free path, a robust low level controller is required to precisely follow this trajectory. However, connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) are inherently affected by communication delays and computation delays, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional controllers such as PID or other more advanced controllers like disturbance observers (DOB). While DOB-based designs have shown effectiveness in rejecting disturbances under nominal conditions, their performance deteriorates considerably in the presence of unknown time delays. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a delay-tolerant communication disturbance observer (CDOB) framework for path-tracking control in delayed systems. The proposed CDOB compensates for the adverse effects of time delays, maintaining accurate trajectory tracking even under uncertain and varying delay conditions. It is shown through a simulation study that the proposed control architecture maintains close alignment with the reference trajectory across various scenarios, including single lane change, double-= lane change, and Elastic Band generated collision avoidance paths under various time delays. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches in both tracking accuracy and delay robustness, making it well suited for autonomous driving applications.

Title: Next-Generation MAC Technique for Priority Handling in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Anwar Ahmed Khan, Farid Nait-Abdesselam, Indrakshi Dey
Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC (DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous traffic.

Title: Optimizing Next Generation Wireless BAN with Prioritized Access for Heterogeneous Traffic
Authors: Shama Sidiqui, Indrakshi Dey
Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to efficiently handle urgent-priority data.

Title: A Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Framework with Soft Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems
Authors: Chams Eddine Mballo, Donggun Lee, Claire J. Tomlin
Abstract: Traditional reachability methods provide formal guarantees of safety under bounded disturbances. However, they strictly enforce state constraints as inviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in complex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such as bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed envelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are inherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined safety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands, albeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This paper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of safety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints. Specifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred to as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed to reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring that cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified budget. The framework comprises two principal components: (i) an augmented-state model with an auxiliary budget state that tracks soft-constraint violations, and (ii) a regularization-based approximation of the discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi value function associated with the reach-avoid differential game studied herein. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical examples involving the landing of a simple point-mass model and a fixed-wing aircraft executing an emergency descent, both under wind disturbances. The simulation results validate the framework's ability to simultaneously manage both hard and soft constraints in safety-critical settings

Title: Hybrid Liquid Neural Network-Random Finite Set Filtering for Robust Maneuvering Object Tracking
Authors: Minti Liu, Qinghua Guo, Cao Zeng, Yanguang Yu, Jun Li, Ming Jin
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex motion patterns, a task in which conventional methods often struggle due to their reliance on predefined motion models. We integrate a data-driven liquid neural network (LNN) into the random finite set (RFS) framework, leading to two LNN-RFS filters. By learning continuous-time dynamics directly from data, the LNN enables the filters to adapt to complex, nonlinear motion and achieve accurate tracking of highly maneuvering objects in clutter. This hybrid approach preserves the inherent multi-object tracking strengths of the RFS framework while improving flexibility and robustness. Simulation results on challenging maneuvering scenarios demonstrate substantial gains of the proposed hybrid approach in tracking accuracy.

Title: EasyEyes: Online hearing research using speakers calibrated by phones
Authors: Ivan Vican, Hugo De Moraes, Chongjun Liao, Nathnael H. Tsegaye, William O'Gara, Jasper Inamoto, Denis G. Pelli
Abstract: Hearing research requires a calibrated sound source, traditionally as lab equipment. Online research is quicker and more inclusive, but most participants lack calibration equipment and their sound sources are uncalibrated and diverse. This article explains how the open-source this http URL calibrates loudspeakers online. A library of smartphone-microphone profiles allows EasyEyes to use the participant's phone to calibrate their computer's loudspeaker in three minutes. Participants select their phone model, which is verified by screen size. Calibration employs the Novak et al. nonsynchronous maximum-length-sequence (MLS) algorithm. The computer's loudspeaker is corrected by convolving its input with the inverse of its impulse response. Researchers can contribute to the open-access library by calibrating phones with a measurement microphone. In the library, each profile is linked back to the profile used to produce it, back to the manufacturer profile of a measurement microphone. Correction accuracy is such that playing the flat-spectrum MLS through the corrected loudspeaker produces a nearly flat spectrum, with standard deviation less than 3 dB. A survey shows that a library of 94 phone models from major brands will support most participants in the USA (87%) and UK (80%). This method facilitates efficient and inclusive online hearing research.

Title: Control Synthesis with Reinforcement Learning: A Modeling Perspective
Authors: Nikki Xu, Hien Tran
Abstract: Controllers designed with reinforcement learning can be sensitive to model mismatch. We demonstrate that designing such controllers in a virtual simulation environment with an inaccurate model is not suitable for deployment in a physical setup. Controllers designed using an accurate model is robust against disturbance and small mismatch between the physical setup and the mathematical model derived from first principles; while a poor model results in a controller that performs well in simulation but fails in physical experiments. Sensitivity analysis is used to justify these discrepancies and an empirical region of attraction estimation help us visualize their robustness.

Title: Stochastic Long-Term Joint Decarbonization Planning for Power Systems and Data Centers: A Case Study in PJM
Authors: Zhentong Shao, Nanpeng Yu, Daniel Wong
Abstract: With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services, data centers have become critical infrastructures driving digital economies, with increasing energy demand heightening concerns over electricity use and carbon emissions, emphasizing the need for carbon-aware infrastructure planning. Most studies assume static power systems, focus only on operational emissions, and overlook co-optimization. This paper proposes a dynamic joint planning framework that co-optimizes long-term data center and power system development over 15 years. The model determines siting, capacity, and type of data centers alongside power generation expansion, storage deployment, and retirements, accounting for both operational and embodied emissions. To handle multi-scale uncertainty, a large-scale two-stage stochastic program is formulated and solved via an enhanced Benders decomposition. Applied to the PJM Interconnection, with curated datasets released on GitHub, results show the system can support up to 55 GW peak data center demand, with Virginia (DOM) and Northern Illinois (ComEd) as optimal hosts. Compared to non-joint planning, the framework cuts investment cost by 12.6%, operational cost by 8.25%, and emissions by 5.63%. Including lifecycle emissions further raises renewable deployment by 25.5%, highlighting embodied carbon's role in deeper decarbonization.

Title: The Waterbed Effect on Quasiperiodic Disturbance Observer: Avoidance of Sensitivity Tradeoff with Time Delays
Authors: Hisayoshi Muramatsu
Abstract: In linear time-invariant systems, the sensitivity function to disturbances is designed under a sensitivity tradeoff known as the waterbed effect. To compensate for a quasiperiodic disturbance, a quasiperiodic disturbance observer using time delays was proposed. Its sensitivity function avoids the sensitivity tradeoff, achieving wideband harmonic suppression without amplifying aperiodic disturbances or shifting harmonic suppression frequencies. However, its open-loop transfer function is not rational and does not satisfy the assumptions of existing Bode sensitivity integrals due to its time delays. This paper provides Bode-like sensitivity integrals for the quasiperiodic disturbance observer in both continuous-time and discrete-time representations and clarifies the avoided sensitivity tradeoff with time delays.

Title: Transformers in Medicine: Improving Vision-Language Alignment for Medical Image Captioning
Authors: Yogesh Thakku Suresh, Vishwajeet Shivaji Hogale, Luca-Alexandru Zamfira, Anandavardhana Hegde
Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting.

Title: Retaining Mixture Representations for Domain Generalized Anomalous Sound Detection
Authors: Phurich Saengthong, Tomoya Nishida, Kota Dohi, Natsuo Yamashita, Yohei Kawaguchi
Abstract: Anomalous sound detection (ASD) in the wild requires robustness to distribution shifts such as unseen low-SNR input mixtures of machine and noise types. State-of-the-art systems extract embeddings from an adapted audio encoder and detect anomalies via nearest-neighbor search, but fine tuning on noisy machine sounds often acts like a denoising objective, suppressing noise and reducing generalization under mismatched mixtures or inconsistent labeling. Training-free systems with frozen self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders avoid this issue and show strong first-shot generalization, yet their performance drops when mixture embeddings deviate from clean-source embeddings. We propose to improve SSL backbones with a retain-not-denoise strategy that better preserves information from mixed sound sources. The approach combines a multi-label audio tagging loss with a mixture alignment loss that aligns student mixture embeddings to convex teacher embeddings of clean and noise inputs. Controlled experiments on stationary, non-stationary, and mismatched noise subsets demonstrate improved robustness under distribution shifts, narrowing the gap toward oracle mixture representations.

Title: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Tradeoff for Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Zihao Zhou, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically, in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions. In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service coverage increase.

Title: State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation
Authors: Qi You, Qinghua Huang, Yi-Cheng Lin
Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.

Title: Silicon-based Josephson junction field-effect transistors enabling cryogenic logic and quantum technologies
Authors: Yusheng Xiong, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: The continuous miniaturisation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) from long- to short-channel architectures has advanced beyond the predictions of Moore's Law. Continued advances in semiconductor electronics, even near current scaling and performance boundaries under cryogenic conditions, are driving the development of innovative device paradigms that enable ultra-low-power and high-speed functionality. Among emerging candidates, the Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JJFET or JoFET) provides an alternative by integrating superconducting source and drain electrodes for efficient, phase-coherent operation at ultra-low temperatures. These hybrid devices have the potential to bridge conventional semiconductor electronics with cryogenic logic and quantum circuits, enabling energy-efficient and high-coherence signal processing across temperature domains. This review traces the evolution from Josephson junctions to field-effect transistors, emphasising the structural and functional innovations that underpin modern device scalability. The performance and material compatibility of JJFETs fabricated on Si, GaAs, and InGaAs substrates are analysed, alongside an assessment of their switching dynamics and material compatibility. Particular attention is given to superconductor-silicon-superconductor Josephson junctions as the active core of JJFET architectures. By unfolding more than four decades of experimental progress, this work highlights the promise of JJFETs as foundational building blocks for next-generation cryogenic logic and quantum electronic systems.

Title: Separating peripheral and higher-level effects on speech intelligibility using a hearing loss simulator and an objective intelligibility measure
Authors: Toshio Irino, Ayako Yamamoto, Fuki Miyazaki
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for separating the effects of peripheral hearing loss (HL) and higher-level processes on speech intelligibility (SI). In a previous study, we conducted an SI experiment with 14 older adult (OA) listeners, using speech-in-noise sounds that were either processed with an ideal ratio mask (IRM) enhancement technique or left unprocessed. The current study involved an SI experiment with 15 young, normal-hearing (YNH) listeners. This experiment used simulated HL sounds processed with the WHIS simulator that reflected the hearing level of a specific OA from the previous study. The results showed that the target OA's SI scores were higher than the average YNH scores. This implies that the target OA's higher-level processes may be more effective than those of the average YNH. To understand the characteristics of other OAs, we used the GESI objective intelligibility measure to predict SI. First, we confirmed that GESI could fairly accurately predict the SI scores for both the YNH and OA listeners. Next, we predicted the SI scores of the 14 OA listeners using the parameters estimated in the YNH experiment. The results showed that some OAs had higher SI scores than the average YNH, while one OA had lower scores. These differences in SI scores may reflect variations in the efficiency of higher-level this http URL results imply that WHIS and GESI could facilitate contrastive experiments between YNH and OA listeners, regardless of hearing level. This would allow us to study the effects of higher-level processes in OA listeners individually.

Title: Cramér-Rao Bound Optimization for Movable Antenna-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Uplink Communication System
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Yang Liu, Qiong Wu
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna (FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in the ISAC system.

Title: Shared Control for Vehicle Lane-Changing with Uncertain Driver Behaviors
Authors: Jiamin Wu, Chenguang Zhao, Huan Yu
Abstract: Lane changes are common yet challenging driving maneuvers that require continuous decision-making and dynamic interaction with surrounding vehicles. Relying solely on human drivers for lane-changing can lead to traffic disturbances due to the stochastic nature of human behavior and its variability under different task demands. Such uncertainties may significantly degrade traffic string stability, which is critical for suppressing disturbance propagation and ensuring smooth merging of the lane-changing vehicles. This paper presents a human-automation shared lane-changing control framework that preserves driver authority while allowing automated assistance to achieve stable maneuvers in the presence of driver's behavioral uncertainty. Human driving behavior is modeled as a Markov jump process with transitions driven by task difficulty, providing a tractable representation of stochastic state switching. Based on this model, we first design a nominal stabilizing controller that guarantees stochastic ${L}_2$ string stability under imperfect mode estimation. To further balance performance and automated effort, we then develop a Minimal Intervention Controller (MIC) that retains acceptable stability while limiting automation. Simulations using lane-changing data from the NGSIM dataset verify that the nominal controller reduces speed perturbations and shorten lane-changing time, while the MIC further reduces automated effort and enhances comfort but with moderate stability and efficiency loss. Validations on the TGSIM dataset with SAE Level 2 vehicles show that the MIC enables earlier lane changes than Level 2 control while preserving driver authority with a slight stability compromise. These findings highlight the potential of shared control strategies to balance stability, efficiency, and driver acceptance.

Title: Fair Rate Maximization for Multi-user Multi-cell MISO Communication Systems via Novel Transmissive RIS Transceiver
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Zhendong Li, Kunlun Wang, Hongying Tang, Jun Li
Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.

Title: Millimeter-Wave Radar Sensing of Wombat Respiration
Authors: Marina Murakami, Ryoko Iwase, Chiemi Iba, Daisuke Ogura, Takuya Sakamoto
Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function, capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and 0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and December. The results support the potential application of this method to non-contact health monitoring of wombats.

Title: Data-Enabled Predictive Control and Guidance for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
Authors: Sebastian Zieglmeier, Mathias Hudoba de Badyn, Narada D. Warakagoda, Thomas R. Krogstad, Paal Engelstad
Abstract: This paper presents a fully data-driven control framework for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC). The approach eliminates the need for explicit hydrodynamic modeling by exploiting measured input-output data to predict and optimize future system behavior. Classic DeePC was employed in the heading control, while a cascaded DeePC architecture is proposed for depth regulation, incorporating a loop-frequency separation to handle the different dynamic modes of input and output. For 3-D waypoint path following, the Adaptive Line-of-Sight algorithm is extended to a predictive formulation and integrated with DeePC. All methods are validated in extensive simulation on the REMUS 100 AUV and compared with classical PI/PID control. The results demonstrate superior tracking performance and robustness of DeePC under ocean-current disturbances and nonlinear operating conditions, while significantly reducing modeling effort.

Title: Tight Collision Avoidance for Stochastic Optimal Control: with Applications in Learning-based, Interactive Motion Planning
Authors: Erik Börve, Nikolce Murgovski, Leo Laine
Abstract: Trajectory planning in dense, interactive traffic scenarios presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, primarily due to the uncertainty of human driver behavior and the non-convex nature of collision avoidance constraints. This paper introduces a stochastic optimal control framework to address these issues simultaneously, without excessively conservative approximations. We opt to model human driver decisions as a Markov Decision Process and propose a method for handling collision avoidance between non-convex vehicle shapes by imposing a positive distance constraint between compact sets. In this framework, we investigate three alternative chance constraint formulations. To ensure computational tractability, we introduce tight, continuously differentiable reformulations of both the non-convex distance constraints and the chance constraints. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through simulation studies of two challenging interactive scenarios: an unregulated intersection crossing and a highway lane change in dense traffic.

Title: Lightweight Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Computing with Statistical and Device Heterogeneity Awareness
Authors: Jinghong Tan, Zhichen Zhang, Kun Guo, Tsung-Hui Chang, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, but high communication and computation costs, exacerbated by statistical and device heterogeneity, limit its practicality in mobile edge computing. Existing compression methods like sparsification and pruning reduce per-round costs but may increase training rounds and thus the total training cost, especially under heterogeneous environments. We propose a lightweight personalized FL framework built on parameter decoupling, which separates the model into shared and private subspaces, enabling us to uniquely apply gradient sparsification to the shared component and model pruning to the private one. This structural separation confines communication compression to global knowledge exchange and computation reduction to local personalization, protecting personalization quality while adapting to heterogeneous client resources. We theoretically analyze convergence under the combined effects of sparsification and pruning, revealing a sparsity-pruning trade-off that links to the iteration complexity. Guided by this analysis, we formulate a joint optimization that selects per-client sparsity and pruning rates and wireless bandwidth to reduce end-to-end training time. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence and substantial reductions in overall communication and computation costs with negligible accuracy loss, validating the benefits of coordinated and resource-aware personalization in resource-constrained heterogeneous environments.

Title: Low-Overhead CSI Prediction via Gaussian Process Regression -- Part~I: Data-Driven Spatial Interpolation
Authors: Syed Luqman Shah, Nurul Huda Mahmood, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries, thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis function, Matérn, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with 50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving over 92% of the link capacity.

Title: Model-Free Robust Beamforming in Satellite Downlink using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Alea Schröder, Steffen Gracla, Carsten Bockelmann, Dirk Wübben, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios. The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for use and reproduction of the results.

Title: Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling for Secure RIS-Assisted ISAC in 6G UAV Corridors
Authors: Sana Hafeez, Ghulam E Mustafa Abro, Hifza Mustafa
Abstract: The rapid deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) corridors in sixth-generation (6G) networks requires safe, intelligence-driven integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance spectrum efficiency, localisation accuracy, and situational awareness, while introducing new vulnerabilities. The rise of quantum computing increases the risks associated with harvest-now-decrypt-later strategies and quantum-enhanced spoofing. We propose a Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling (QRTM) framework for RIS-assisted ISAC in UAV corridors to address these challenges. QRTM integrates classical, quantum-ready, and quantum-aided adversaries, countered using post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives: ML-KEM for key establishment and Falcon for authentication, both embedded within RIS control signalling and UAV coordination. To strengthen security sensing, the framework introduces RIS-coded scene watermarking validated through a generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT), with its detection probability characterised by the Marcum Q function. Furthermore, a Secure ISAC Utility (SIU) jointly optimises secrecy rate, spoofing detection, and throughput under RIS constraints, enabled by a scheduler with computational complexity of O(n^2). Monte Carlo evaluations using 3GPP Release 19 mid-band urban-canyon models (7-15 GHz) demonstrate a spoof-detection probability approaching 0.99 at a false-alarm rate of 1e-3, secrecy-rate retention exceeding 90 percent against quantum-capable adversaries, and signal-interference utilisation improvements of about 25 percent compared with baselines. These results show a standards-compliant path towards reliable, quantum-resilient ISAC for UAV corridors in smart cities and non-terrestrial networks.

Title: Adaptive End-to-End Transceiver Design for NextG Pilot-Free and CP-Free Wireless Systems
Authors: Jiaming Cheng, Wei Chen, Bo Ai
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems, where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E) transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems. The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter (CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native NextG.

Title: Improving Temporal Consistency and Fidelity at Inference-time in Perceptual Video Restoration by Zero-shot Image-based Diffusion Models
Authors: Nasrin Rahimi, A. Murat Tekalp
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.

Title: Learning-Based Blockage-Resilient Beam Training in Near-Field Terahertz Communications
Authors: Caihao Weng, Yuqing Guo, Bowen Zhao, Ying Wang, Wen Chen, Zhendong Li
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network (AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping while significantly reducing training overhead.

Title: Echo-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Multi-Target Tracking in RF Sensing
Authors: Amirhossein Azarbahram, Onel L. A. López
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for integrated sensing and communications.

Title: Adaptive Channel Estimation and Quantized Feedback for RIS Assisted Optical Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Muhammad Khalil, Ke Wang, Jinho Choi
Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, estimation, and feedback framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface RIS-assisted optical wireless links. The key modeling element is a long-exposure pixel gain that extends the classical diffraction-limited response by statistically averaging angular jitter and mispointing; it admits an exact real-integral form and captures boresight attenuation and progressive sidelobe filling. The end-to-end system couples free-space path loss, Beer--Lambert atmospheric extinction, pixel-level diffraction, and optical efficiency with a unitary-pilot least-squares channel estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels, pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of 0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.

Title: Dynamic Beamforming and Power Allocation in ISAC via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Duc Nguyen Dao, André B. J. Kokkeler, Haibin Zhang, Yang Miao
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks, where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal strategies through trial and error, guided by predefined rewards. Simulation results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500 ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in dynamic scenarios.

Title: A New Neural Network Paradigm for Scalable and Generalizable Stability Analysis of Power Systems
Authors: Tong Han, Yan Xu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a new neural network (NN) paradigm for scalable and generalizable stability analysis of power systems. The paradigm consists of two parts: the neural stability descriptor and the sample-augmented iterative training scheme. The first part, based on system decomposition, constructs the object (such as a stability function or condition) for stability analysis as a scalable aggregation of multiple NNs. These NNs remain fixed across varying power system structures and parameters, and are repeatedly shared within each system instance defined by these variations, thereby enabling the generalization of the neural stability descriptor across a class of power systems. The second part learns the neural stability descriptor by iteratively training the NNs with sample augmentation, guided by the tailored conservativeness-aware loss function. The training set is strategically constructed to promote the descriptor's generalizability, which is systematically evaluated by verification and validation during the training process. Specifically, the proposed NN paradigm is implemented for large-disturbance stability analysis of the bulk power grid and small-disturbance stability conditions of the microgrid system. Finally, numerical studies for the two implementations demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed NN paradigm.

Title: Optimal and Heuristic Approaches for Platooning Systems with Deadlines
Authors: Thiago S. Gomides, Evangelos Kranakis, Ioannis Lambadaris, Yannis Viniotis, Gennady Shaikhet
Abstract: Efficient truck platooning is a key strategy for reducing freight costs, lowering fuel consumption, and mitigating emissions. Deadlines are critical in this context, as trucks must depart within specific time windows to meet delivery requirements and avoid penalties. In this paper, we investigate the optimal formation and dispatch of truck platoons at a highway station with finite capacity $L$ and deadline constraints $T$. The system operates in discrete time, with each arriving truck assigned a deadline of $T$ slot units. The objective is to leverage the efficiency gains from forming large platoons while accounting for waiting costs and deadline violations. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and analyze the structure of the optimal policy $\pi^\star$ for $L = 3$, extending insights to arbitrary $L$. We prove that the $\pi^\star$ is monotone in the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and identify classes of unreachable states. Moreover, since $\mathcal{S}$ grows exponentially with $L$ and $T$, we propose heuristics-including conditional and deep-learning based approaches-that exploit these structural insights while maintaining low computational complexity.

Title: PitchFlower: A flow-based neural audio codec with pitch controllability
Authors: Diego Torres, Axel Roebel, Nicolas Obin
Abstract: We present PitchFlower, a flow-based neural audio codec with explicit pitch controllability. Our approach enforces disentanglement through a simple perturbation: during training, F0 contours are flattened and randomly shifted, while the true F0 is provided as conditioning. A vector-quantization bottleneck prevents pitch recovery, and a flow-based decoder generates high quality audio. Experiments show that PitchFlower achieves more accurate pitch control than WORLD at much higher audio quality, and outperforms SiFiGAN in controllability while maintaining comparable quality. Beyond pitch, this framework provides a simple and extensible path toward disentangling other speech attributes.

Title: Lost in Phonation: Voice Quality Variation as an Evaluation Dimension for Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Harm Lameris, Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish, Joakim Gustafson, Éva Székely
Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal. One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality, encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality, designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular non-lexical aspects of speech perception.

Title: Incorporating Social Awareness into Control of Unknown Multi-Agent Systems: A Real-Time Spatiotemporal Tubes Approach
Authors: Siddhartha Upadhyay, Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates social awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is assigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or self-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system. Building on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT framework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its social interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby avoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a socially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The proposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is computationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through simulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional

Title: Quickest Change Point Detection with Measurements over a Lossy Link
Authors: Krishna Chaythanya KV, Saqib Abbas Baba, Anurag Kumar, Arpan Chattopadhyay, Rajesh Sundaresan
Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection (QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the non-asymptotic regime.

Title: Continuous subsurface property retrieval from sparse radar observations using physics informed neural networks
Authors: Ishfaq Aziz, Mohamad Alipour
Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements (R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2). Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.

Title: An OPF-based Control Framework for Hybrid AC-MTDC Power Systems under Uncertainty
Authors: Hongjin Du, Rahul Rane, Weijie Xia, Pedro P. Vergara, Aleksandra Lekić
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, introduces significant uncertainty into hybrid AC-HVDC systems due to forecast errors and power fluctuations. Conventional control strategies typically rely on fixed setpoints and neglect frequency deviations, which can compromise system stability under rapid renewable variations. To address this challenge, this paper presents a forecast-integrated, optimal power flow (OPF)-based adaptive control framework. Wind speed forecasts generated using a Random Forest model are incorporated into a time-coupled OPF to determine baseline converter setpoints in anticipation of wind fluctuations, which are further adjusted in real time based on actual operating conditions. An adaptive droop control scheme is developed that jointly considers DC voltage and AC frequency deviations. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, demonstrating its capability to ensure stable and robust operation of hybrid AC-HVDC systems under high penetration of renewable energy.

Title: PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering
Authors: John-Joseph Brady, Benjamin Cox, Víctor Elvira, Yunpeng Li
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.

Title: Over 3 kV and Ultra-Low leakage Vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Power Diodes with Engineered Schottky Contact and High-permittivity Dielectric Field Plate
Authors: Emerson J. Hollar, Esmat Farzana
Abstract: We report over 3 kV breakdown voltage and ultra-low leakage (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices utilizing Schottky barrier engineering and high-permittivity (\k{appa}) dielectric (ZrO2) field plate. The (011) orientation of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift layers which are promising to support kV-class vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power switches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse blocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the interfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a co-processed Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same wafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the field-plate Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage of 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the breakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown voltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management by composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage, edge field reduction by high-\k{appa} dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as the advantageous material properties offered by (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 demonstrate a promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices.

Title: Physics-Guided Conditional Diffusion Networks for Microwave Image Reconstruction
Authors: Shirin Chehelgami, Joe LoVetri, Vahab Khoshdel
Abstract: A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust, data-driven microwave imaging.

Title: Low Probability of Detection Communication Using Noncoherent Grassmannian Signaling
Authors: Diego Cuevas, Mikel Gutiérrez, Jesús Ibáñez, Ignacio Santamaria
Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD) communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and performance.

Title: Artificial Transmission Line Synthesis Tailored for Traveling-Wave Parametric Processes
Authors: M. Malnou
Abstract: Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and capacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design methods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are lacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial transmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive network synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space: periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission line.

Title: Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However, simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Title: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds
Authors: Ziyang Xu, Olaf Wysocki, Christoph Holst
Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data, which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage. Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation, providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

Title: Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Yujie Nie, Jianzhang Ni, Yonglong Ye, Yuan-Ting Zhang, Yun Kwok Wing, Xiangqing Xu, Xin Ma, Lizhou Fan
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions.

Title: FPGA-based Lane Detection System incorporating Temperature and Light Control Units
Authors: Ibrahim Qamar, Saber Mahmoud, Seif Megahed, Mohamed Khaled, Saleh Hesham, Ahmed Matar, Saif Gebril, Mervat Mahmoud
Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding environmental conditions.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to QoSAware Load Balancing in 5G Cellular Networks under User Mobility and Observation Uncertainty
Authors: Mehrshad Eskandarpour, Hossein Soleimani
Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators (aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends (higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based toolchain.

Title: Defect Mitigation for Robot Arm-based Additive Manufacturing Utilizing Intelligent Control and IOT
Authors: Matsive Ali, Blake Gassen, Sen Liu
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated robotic fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing system featuring closed-loop thermal control and intelligent in-situ defect correction using a 6-degree of freedom robotic arm and an Oak-D camera. The robot arm end effector was modified to mount an E3D hotend thermally regulated by an IoT microcontroller, enabling precise temperature control through real-time feedback. Filament extrusion system was synchronized with robotic motion, coordinated via ROS2, ensuring consistent deposition along complex trajectories. A vision system based on OpenCV detects layer-wise defects position, commanding autonomous re-extrusion at identified sites. Experimental validation demonstrated successful defect mitigation in printing operations. The integrated system effectively addresses challenges real-time quality assurance. Inverse kinematics were used for motion planning, while homography transformations corrected camera perspectives for accurate defect localization. The intelligent system successfully mitigated surface anomalies without interrupting the print process. By combining real-time thermal regulation, motion control, and intelligent defect detection & correction, this architecture establishes a scalable and adaptive robotic additive manufacturing framework suitable for aerospace, biomedical, and industrial applications.

Title: Resi-VidTok: An Efficient and Decomposed Progressive Tokenization Framework for Ultra-Low-Rate and Lightweight Video Transmission
Authors: Zhenyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Zhi Ding
Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete, importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens, Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios (CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps, demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient, latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

Title: Disentangling Shared and Private Neural Dynamics with SPIRE: A Latent Modeling Framework for Deep Brain Stimulation
Authors: Rahil Soroushmojdehi, Sina Javadzadeh, Mehrnaz Asadi, Terence D.Sanger
Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE (Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents, SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation (DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies. These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

Title: Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally Incongruent Speech
Authors: Pedro Corrêa, João Lima, Victor Moreno, Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa
Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples, a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Title: Joint Analysis of Acoustic Scenes and Sound Events Based on Semi-Supervised Training of Sound Events With Partial Labels
Authors: Keisuke Imoto
Abstract: Annotating time boundaries of sound events is labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of strongly supervised learning in audio detection. To reduce annotation costs, weakly-supervised learning with only clip-level labels has been widely adopted. As an alternative, partial label learning offers a cost-effective approach, where a set of possible labels is provided instead of exact weak annotations. However, partial label learning for audio analysis remains largely unexplored. Motivated by the observation that acoustic scenes provide contextual information for constructing a set of possible sound events, we utilize acoustic scene information to construct partial labels of sound events. On the basis of this idea, in this paper, we propose a multitask learning framework that jointly performs acoustic scene classification and sound event detection with partial labels of sound events. While reducing annotation costs, weakly-supervised and partial label learning often suffer from decreased detection performance due to lacking the precise event set and their temporal annotations. To better balance between annotation cost and detection performance, we also explore a semi-supervised framework that leverages both strong and partial labels. Moreover, to refine partial labels and achieve better model training, we propose a label refinement method based on self-distillation for the proposed approach with partial labels.

Abstract: In this work, we propose neighborhood feature pooling (NFP) as a novel texture feature extraction method for remote sensing image classification. The NFP layer captures relationships between neighboring inputs and efficiently aggregates local similarities across feature dimensions. Implemented using convolutional layers, NFP can be seamlessly integrated into any network. Results comparing the baseline models and the NFP method indicate that NFP consistently improves performance across diverse datasets and architectures while maintaining minimal parameter overhead.

Title: Machine Learning and CPU (Central Processing Unit) Scheduling Co-Optimization over a Network of Computing Centers
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Zulfiya R. Gabidullina, Hamid R. Rabiee
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and (ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications, distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

Title: SFMS-ALR: Script-First Multilingual Speech Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution
Authors: Dharma Teja Donepudi
Abstract: Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution (SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML representation with appropriate "lang" or "voice" spans and synthesizes the utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models, SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility, naturalness, and user preference.

Title: Minimum time consensus for damped second order agents using Gröbner basis
Authors: Akansha Rautela, Deepak U. Patil, Ameer Mulla, Indra Narayan Kar
Abstract: A problem of achieving minimum time consensus for a set of $N$ second-order LTI system agents with bounded inputs and fuel constraints is considered. Unlike our other works, here the damping effect in agent dynamics is included. First, the attainable set for each agent with fuel budget constraints is characterized, and its boundary equations are derived. Then, using the convexity property, the minimum time at which attainable sets of all agents have a non-empty intersection is computed. By applying Helly's theorem, the computation reduces to finding the minimum time to consensus and the corresponding consensus point for each of the triplets separately.

Monitoring these biomarkers regularly and in a non-invasive manner would enable early insight into metabolic status and vascular health. Currently, there are only a handful of non-invasive monitoring systems. Optical methods offer molecular specificity (i.e., multi-biomarker monitoring) but have shallow reach (a few millimeters); ultrasound penetrates deeper but lacks specificity; and MRI is large, slow, and costly. Photoacoustic (PA) sensing combines the best of optical and ultrasound methods. A laser transmitter emits pulses that are absorbed by different molecules, providing specificity. These light pulses generate pressure changes that are captured by an ultrasound receiver, providing depth. Photoacoustic sensing is promising, but the current platforms are bulky, complex, and costly. We propose the first embedded PA platform. Our contributions are fourfold. First, inspired by LiDAR technology, we propose a novel transmitter that emits pulses similar to those in the state-of-the-art (SoA), but instead of using high-voltage sources and complex electronic interfaces, we use a simple low-power microcontroller (MCU). Second, we carry out a thorough analysis of our custom transmitter and a commercial system. Third, we build a basic ultrasound receiver that is able to process the faint signal generated by our transmitter. Lastly, we compare the performance of our platform against a SoA commercial system, and show that we can detect glucose and (de)oxygenated hemoglobin in two controlled solution studies. The resulting signal characteristics indicate a plausible path toward noninvasive, real-time, at-home sensing relevant to diabetes care. More broadly, this platform lays the groundwork for translating the promise of PA sensing into a broader practical reality.

Title: Seeing Clearly and Deeply: An RGBD Imaging Approach with a Bio-inspired Monocentric Design
Authors: Zongxi Yu, Xiaolong Qian, Shaohua Gao, Qi Jiang, Yao Gao, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge: conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this, we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

Title: Energy consumption assessment of a Virtual Reality Remote Rendering application over 5G networks
Authors: Roberto Viola, Mikel Irazola, José Ramón Juárez, Minh Nguyen, Alexander Zoubarev, Alexander Futasz, Louay Bassbouss, Amr A. AbdelNabi, Javier Fernández Hidalgo
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy implications of remote rendering for Virtual Reality (VR) applications within a real 5G testbed. Remote rendering enables lightweight devices to access high-performance graphical content by offloading computationally intensive tasks to Cloud-native Network Functions (CNFs) running on remote servers. However, this approach raises concerns regarding energy consumption across the various network components involved, including the remote computing node, the 5G Core, the Radio Access Network (RAN), and the User Equipment (UE). This work proposes and evaluates two complementary energy monitoring solutions, one hardware-based and one software-based, to measure energy consumption at different system levels. A VR remote renderer, deployed as CNF and leveraging the Media over QUIC (MoQ) protocol, is used as test case for assessing its energy footprint under different multimedia and network configurations. The results provide critical insights into the trade-off between energy consumption and performance of a real-world VR application running in a 5G environment.

Title: Integrating Legal and Logical Specifications in Perception, Prediction, and Planning for Automated Driving: A Survey of Methods
Authors: Kumar Manas, Mert Keser, Alois Knoll
Abstract: This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms, facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible. The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception, logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation. We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.

Title: AirCNN via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Architecture Design and Implementation
Authors: Meng Hua, Haotian Wu, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: This paper introduces AirCNN, a novel paradigm for implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via over-the-air (OTA) analog computation. By leveraging multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD, MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS, especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.

Title: Data-Driven Stabilization Using Prior Knowledge on Stabilizability and Controllability
Authors: Amir Shakouri, Henk J. van Waarde, Tren M.J.T. Baltussen, W.P.M.H. (Maurice)Heemels
Abstract: In this work, we study data-driven stabilization of linear time-invariant systems using prior knowledge of system-theoretic properties, specifically stabilizability and controllability. To formalize this, we extend the concept of data informativity by requiring the existence of a controller that stabilizes all systems consistent with the data and the prior knowledge. We show that if the system is controllable, then incorporating this as prior knowledge does not relax the conditions required for data-driven stabilization. Remarkably, however, we show that if the system is stabilizable, then using this as prior knowledge leads to necessary and sufficient conditions that are weaker than those for data-driven stabilization without prior knowledge. In other words, data-driven stabilization is easier if one knows that the underlying system is stabilizable. We also provide new data-driven control design methods in terms of linear matrix inequalities that complement the conditions for informativity.

Title: Combining Moving Mass Actuators and Manoeuvring Models for Underwater Vehicles: A Lagrangian Approach
Authors: Alexander B. Rambech, Ivar B. Saksvik, Vahid Hassani
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator. Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen (1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass actuator formulation.

Title: Sum-of-Squares Certificates for Almost-Sure Reachability of Stochastic Polynomial Systems
Authors: Arash Bahari Kordabad, Rupak Majumdar, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational approach to certify almost sure reachability for discrete-time polynomial stochastic systems by turning drift--variant criteria into sum-of-squares (SOS) programs solved with standard semidefinite solvers. Specifically, we provide an SOS method based on two complementary certificates: (i) a drift certificate that enforces a radially unbounded function to be non-increasing in expectation outside a compact set of states; and (ii) a variant certificate that guarantees a one-step decrease with positive probability and ensures the target contains its nonpositive sublevel set. We transform these conditions to SOS constraints. For the variant condition, we enforce a robust decrease over a parameterized disturbance ball with nonzero probability and encode the constraints via an S-procedure with polynomial multipliers. The resulting bilinearities are handled by an alternating scheme that alternates between optimizing multipliers and updating the variant and radius until a positive slack is obtained. Two case studies illustrate the workflow and certifies almost-sure reachability.

Title: Controlling Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning with Knowledge-Driven Multiple Hypothesis: Application to Beat Tracking
Authors: Antonin Gagnere, Slim Essid, Geoffroy Peeters
Abstract: Ambiguities in data and problem constraints can lead to diverse, equally plausible outcomes for a machine learning task. In beat and downbeat tracking, for instance, different listeners may adopt various rhythmic interpretations, none of which would necessarily be incorrect. To address this, we propose a contrastive self-supervised pre-training approach that leverages multiple hypotheses about possible positive samples in the data. Our model is trained to learn representations compatible with different such hypotheses, which are selected with a knowledge-based scoring function to retain the most plausible ones. When fine-tuned on labeled data, our model outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks, showcasing the advantages of integrating domain knowledge with multi-hypothesis selection in music representation learning in particular.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Cooperative Rate Splitting for Satellite-to-Underground Communication Networks
Authors: Kaiqiang Lin, Kangchun Zhao, Yijie Mao
Abstract: Reliable downlink communication in satellite-to-underground networks remains challenging due to severe signal attenuation caused by underground soil and refraction in the air-soil interface. To address this, we propose a novel cooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an aboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices (UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization problem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time slot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a deep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling and a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic underground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\%$ over conventional benchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions.

Title: BOLT-GAN: Bayes-Optimal Loss for Stable GAN Training
Authors: Mohammadreza Tavasoli Naeini, Ali Bereyhi, Morteza Noshad, Ben Liang, Alfred O. Hero III
Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60% lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Title: Effect of Full Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems
Authors: Shreya Meel, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness, independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness. Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be $\frac{1}{2}$.

Title: Privacy Preservation by Local Design in Cooperative Networked Control Systems
Authors: Chao Yang, Yuqing Ni, Wen Yang, Hongbo Shi
Abstract: In this paper, we study the privacy preservation problem in a cooperative networked control system, which has closed-loop dynamics, working for the task of linear quadratic Guassian (LQG) control. The system consists of a user and a server: the user owns the plant to control, while the server provides computation capability, and the user employs the server to compute control inputs for it. To enable the server's computation, the user needs to provide the measurements of the plant states to the server, who then calculates estimates of the states, based on which the control inputs are computed. However, the user regards the states as privacy, and makes an interesting request: the user wants the server to have "incorrect" knowledge of the state estimates rather than the true values. Regarding that, we propose a novel design methodology for the privacy preservation, in which the privacy scheme is locally equipped at the user side not open to the server, which manages to create a deviation in the server's knowledge of the state estimates from the true values. However, this methodology also raises significant challenges: in a closed-loop dynamic system, when the server's seized knowledge is incorrect, the system's behavior becomes complex to analyze; even the stability of the system becomes questionable, as the incorrectness will accumulate through the closed loop as time evolves. In this paper, we succeed in showing that the performance loss in LQG control caused by the proposed privacy scheme is bounded by rigorous mathematical proofs, which convinces the availability of the proposed design methodology. We also propose an associated novel privacy metric and obtain the analytical result on evaluating the privacy performance. Finally, we study the performance trade-off between privacy and control, where the accordingly proposed optimization problems are solved by numerical methods efficiently.

Title: Efficient Localization of Directional Emitters via Joint Beampattern Estimation
Authors: Fraser Williams, Akila Pemasiri, Dhammika Jayalath, Terry Martin, Clinton Fookes
Abstract: The localization of directional RF emitters presents significant challenges for electronic warfare applications. Traditional localization methods, designed for omnidirectional emitters, experience degraded performance when applied to directional sources due to pronounced received signal strength (RSS) modulations introduced by directive beampatterns. This paper presents a robust direct position determination (DPD) approach that jointly estimates emitter position and beampattern parameters by incorporating RSS modulation from both path attenuation and directional gain alongside angle of arrival (AOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) information. To address the computational challenge of joint optimization over position and beampattern parameters, we develop an alternating maximization algorithm that decomposes the four-dimensional search into efficient iterative two-dimensional optimizations using a generalized beampattern model. Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis establishes theoretical performance limits, and numerical simulations demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods. At -10 dB SNR, the proposed approach achieves 49% to 61% error reduction compared to AOA-TDOA baselines, with performance approaching the CRLB above -10 dB. The algorithm converges rapidly, requiring 3 to 4 iterations on average, and exhibits robustness to beampattern model mismatch. A contrast-expanded half-power uncertainty metric is introduced to quantify localization confidence, revealing that the proposed method produces concentrated unimodal likelihood surfaces while conventional approaches generate spurious peaks. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that optimal performance occurs when receivers are positioned at beampattern main lobe edges where RSS gradients are maximized.

Title: ES-HPC-MPC: Exponentially Stable Hybrid Perception Constrained MPC for Quadrotor with Suspended Payloads
Authors: Luis F. Recalde, Mrunal Sarvaiya, Giuseppe Loianno, Guanrui Li
Abstract: Aerial transportation using quadrotors with cable-suspended payloads holds great potential for applications in disaster response, logistics, and infrastructure maintenance. However, their hybrid and underactuated dynamics pose significant control and perception challenges. Traditional approaches often assume a taut cable condition, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications where slack-to-taut transitions occur due to disturbances. We introduce ES-HPC-MPC, a model predictive control framework that enforces exponential stability and perception-constrained control under hybrid dynamics. Our method leverages Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions (ES-CLFs) to enforce stability during the tasks and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to maintain the payload within the onboard camera's field of view (FoV). We validate our method through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating stable trajectory tracking and reliable payload perception. We validate that our method maintains stability and satisfies perception constraints while tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories and when the system is subjected to hybrid mode transitions caused by unexpected disturbances.

Title: Fusing Bluetooth With Pedestrian Dead Reckoning: A Floor Plan-Assisted Positioning Approach
Authors: Wenxuan Pan, Yang Yang, Mingzhe Chen, Dong Wei, Caili Guo, Shiwen Mao
Abstract: Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm (FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally, FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.14 m, representing an improvement of over 29% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.

Title: Predicting speech intelligibility in older adults for speech enhancement using the Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index, GESI
Authors: Ayako Yamamoto, Fuki Miyazaki, Toshio Irino
Abstract: We propose an objective intelligibility measure (OIM), called the Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index (GESI), that can predict speech intelligibility (SI) in older adults. GESI is a bottom-up model based on psychoacoustic knowledge from the peripheral to the central auditory system. It computes the single SI metric using the gammachirp filterbank (GCFB), the modulation filterbank, and the extended cosine similarity measure. It takes into account not only the hearing level represented in the audiogram, but also the temporal processing characteristics captured by the temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF). To evaluate performance, SI experiments were conducted with older adults of various hearing levels using speech-in-noise with ideal speech enhancement on familiarity-controlled Japanese words. The prediction performance was compared with HASPIw2, which was developed for keyword SI prediction. The results showed that GESI predicted the subjective SI scores more accurately than HASPIw2. GESI was also found to be at least as effective as, if not more effective than, HASPIv2 in predicting English sentence-level SI. The effect of introducing TMTF into the GESI algorithm was insignificant, suggesting that TMTF measurements and models are not yet mature. Therefore, it may be necessary to perform TMTF measurements with bandpass noise and to improve the incorporation of temporal characteristics into the model.

Title: Cyst-X: A Federated AI System Outperforms Clinical Guidelines to Detect Pancreatic Cancer Precursors and Reduce Unnecessary Surgery

Schoots, Marco J. Bruno, Chenchang Huang, Candice W. Bolan, Tamas Gonda, Frank H. Miller, Rajesh N. Keswani, Michael B. Wallace, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to be the second-deadliest cancer by 2030, making early detection critical. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key cancer precursors, present a clinical dilemma, as current guidelines struggle to stratify malignancy risk, leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed diagnoses. Here, we developed Cyst-X, an AI framework for IPMN risk prediction trained on a unique, multi-center dataset of 1,461 MRI scans from 764 patients. Cyst-X achieves significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.82) than both the established Kyoto guidelines (AUC = 0.75) and expert radiologists, particularly in correct identification of high-risk lesions. Clinically, this translates to a 20% increase in cancer detection sensitivity (87.8% vs. 64.1%) for high-risk lesions. We demonstrate that this performance is maintained in a federated learning setting, allowing for collaborative model training without compromising patient privacy. To accelerate research in early pancreatic cancer detection, we publicly release the Cyst-X dataset and models, providing the first large-scale, multi-center MRI resource for pancreatic cyst analysis.

Title: GENRE-CMR: Generalizable Deep Learning for Diverse Multi-Domain Cardiac MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Kian Anvari Hamedani, Narges Razizadeh, Shahabedin Nabavi, Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam
Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions: (1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Title: Extended k-u Fading Model in mmWave Communication: Statistical Properties and Performance Evaluations
Authors: Jiahuan Wu, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Xinchun Yu, Yuhan Dong
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel small-scale fading model, named the extended k-u model, which incorporates the imbalance of multipath clusters by adding a new parameter based on the original k-u model. The extended k-u model has more accurate modeling capability than the extended {\eta}-u model in scenarios with line-of-sight (LoS) paths. Additionally, it is mathematically more tractable than the a-k-{\eta}-u model. The extended k-u model provides an effective channel modeling tool for millimeter (mmWave) LoS scenarios. Through theoretical derivations, we obtain closed-form expressions for the key statistical characteristics of this model, including the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, moments of arbitrary order, and the moment generating function. Based on these statistics, this study further derives and analyzes the expressions for some performance metrics of the communication system, including the amount of fading, the probability of outage, the average bit error rate, and the effective rate. Using the measured fading data extracted from literature, which cover communication scenarios at 28 GHz, 65 GHz, and 92.5645 GHz with LoS paths, we apply the proposed model in mmWave scenarios and compare it with the k-u model and the extended {\eta}-u model. The results show that the extended k-u model has better capability in characterizing such fading than the other two models, verifying that this extension enhances its ability to model LoS mmWave scenarios.

Title: Vision-Intelligence-Enabled Beam Tracking for Cross-Interface Water-Air Optical Wireless Communications
Authors: Jiayue Liu, Tianqi Mao, Leyu Cao, Weijie Liu, Dezhi Zheng, Julian Cheng, Zhaocheng Wang
Abstract: The rapid expansion of oceanic applications such as underwater surveillance and mineral exploration is driving the need for real-time wireless backhaul of massive observational data. Such demands are challenging to meet using the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater networks owing to its high potential for broadband transmission. However, implementing water-air OWC remains challenging, particularly when signals penetrate the fluctuating interface, where dynamic refraction induces severe beam misalignment with airborne stations. This necessitates real-time transceiver alignment capable of adapting to complex oceanic dynamics, which remains largely unaddressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical channel model for water-air optical transmission across a time-varying sea surface. Based on the model, a vision-based beam tracking algorithm combining convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory with an attention mechanism is developed to extract key spatio-temporal features. Simulations verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms classical methods in maintaining received signal strength and suppressing vision noise, demonstrating its robustness for water-air OWC systems.

Title: NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications
Authors: Ying-Ren Chien, Po-Heng Chou, You-Jie Peng, Chun-Yuan Huang, Hen-Wai Tsao, Yu Tsao
Abstract: To effectively process impulse noise for narrowband powerline communications (NB-PLCs) transceivers, capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise (APIN) is a critical task. However, existing mathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics of noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train NGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise generation; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure the similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and practically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral cyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter; and 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the generated noise samples from the proposed NGGAN are highly close to the real noise samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plots and Fréchet inception distance (FID) analysis have shown that NGGAN outperforms other GAN-based models by generating noise samples with superior fidelity and higher diversity.

Title: Operational Risks in Grid Integration of Large Data Center Loads: Characteristics, Stability Assessments, and Sensitivity Studies
Authors: Kyung-Bin Kwon, Sayak Mukherjee, Veronica Adetola
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.

Title: Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception
Authors: Jiangong Chen, Xia Lei, Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Yuchen Zhang, Christos Masouros, Athina P. Petropulu
Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves' characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed. Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements, thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the actual target.

Title: Multi-robot Motion Planning based on Nets-within-Nets Modeling and Simulation
Authors: Sofia Hustiu, Joaquin Ezpeleta, Cristian Mahulea, Marius Kloetzer
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing motion plans for a heterogeneous team of robots that must cooperate to fulfill a global mission. Robots move in an environment that contains some regions of interest, while the specification for the entire team can include avoidance, visits, or sequencing of these regions of interest. The mission is expressed in terms of a Petri net corresponding to an automaton, while each robot is also modeled by a state machine Petri net. The current work brings about the following contributions with respect to existing solutions for related problems. First, we propose a novel model, denoted High-Level robot team Petri Net (HLrtPN) system, to incorporate the specification and robot models into the Nets-within-Nets paradigm. A guard function, named Global Enabling Function, is designed to synchronize the firing of transitions so that robot motions do not violate the specification. Then, the solution is found by simulating the HLrtPN system in a specific software tool that accommodates Nets-within-Nets. Illustrative examples based on Linear Temporal Logic missions support the computational feasibility of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Background: Development of artificial intelligence (AI) models for lung cancer screening requires large, well-annotated low-dose computed tomography (CT) datasets and rigorous performance benchmarks. Purpose: To create a reproducible benchmarking resource leveraging the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) and multiple public datasets to develop and evaluate models for nodule detection and classification. Materials & Methods: This retrospective study uses the DLCS dataset (1,613 patients; 2,487 nodules) and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D. For detection, MONAI RetinaNet models were trained on DLCS (DLCS-De) and LUNA16 (LUNA16-De) and evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For nodule-level classification, we compare five strategies: pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a self-supervised foundation model (FMCB), and ResNet50 with random initialization versus Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) pretrained with detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Results: For detection on the DLCS test set, DLCS-De achieved sensitivity 0.82 at 2 false positives/scan (CPM 0.63) versus LUNA16-De (0.62, CPM 0.45). For external validation on NLST-3D, DLCS-De (sensitivity 0.72, CPM 0.58) also outperformed LUNA16-De (sensitivity 0.64, CPM 0.49). For classification across multiple datasets, ResNet50-SWS attained AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81), 0.90 (LUNA16; 0.87-0.93), 0.81 (NLST-3D; 0.79-0.82), and 0.80 (LUNA25; 0.78-0.82), matching or exceeding pretrained/self-supervised baselines. Performance differences reflected dataset label standards. Conclusion: This work establishes a standardized benchmarking resource for lung cancer AI research, supporting model development, validation, and translation. All code, models, and data are publicly released to promote reproducibility.

Title: Artificial Neural Networks Trained on Noisy Speech Exhibit the McGurk Effect
Authors: Lukas Grasse, Matthew S. Tata
Abstract: Humans are able to fuse information from both auditory and visual modalities to help with understanding speech. This is demonstrated through a phenomenon known as the McGurk Effect, during which a listener is presented with incongruent auditory and visual speech that fuse together into the percept of illusory intermediate phonemes. Building on a recent framework that proposes how to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural networks, we evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on audiovisual speech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words designed to elicit the McGurk effect. We show that networks trained entirely on congruent audiovisual speech nevertheless exhibit the McGurk percept. We further investigated 'why' by comparing networks trained on clean speech to those trained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with noisy speech led to a pronounced increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses across all models. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the level of auditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of audiovisual integration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this integration failed to develop. These results suggest that excessive noise exposure during critical periods of audiovisual learning may negatively influence the development of audiovisual speech integration. This work also demonstrates that the McGurk effect reliably emerges untrained from the behaviour of both supervised and unsupervised networks, even networks trained only on congruent speech. This supports the notion that artificial neural networks might be useful models for certain aspects of perception and cognition.

Title: Continuity Conditions for Piecewise Quadratic Functions on Simplicial Conic Partitions are Equivalent
Authors: Magne Erlandsen, Tomas Meijer, W. P. M. H. (Maurice)Heemels, Sebastiaan van den Eijnden
Abstract: Analysis of continuous-time piecewise linear systems based on piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov functions typically requires continuity of these functions over a partition of the state space. Several conditions for guaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be found in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity conditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can be based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or numerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.

Title: Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications
Authors: Ioana Hustiu, Roozbeh Abolpour, Cristian Mahulea, Marius Kloetzer
Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.

Title: Online Adaptation for Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations
Authors: Pei-An Hsieh, Kong Yao Chee, M. Ani Hsieh
Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model.

Title: An Adversarial-Driven Experimental Study on Deep Learning for RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Xinyu Cao, Bimal Adhikari, Shangqing Zhao, Jingxian Wu, Yanjun Pan
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.

Title: Application of Whisper in Clinical Practice: the Post-Stroke Speech Assessment during a Naming Task
Authors: Milena Davudova, Ziyuan Cai, Valentina Giunchiglia, Dragos C. Gruia, Giulia Sanguedolce, Adam Hampshire, Fatemeh Geranmayeh
Abstract: Detailed assessment of language impairment following stroke remains a cognitively complex and clinician-intensive task, limiting timely and scalable diagnosis. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) foundation models offer a promising pathway to augment human evaluation through intelligent systems, but their effectiveness in the context of speech and language impairment remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluate whether Whisper, a state-of-the-art ASR foundation model, can be applied to transcribe and analyze speech from patients with stroke during a commonly used picture-naming task. We assess both verbatim transcription accuracy and the model's ability to support downstream prediction of language function, which has major implications for outcomes after stroke. Our results show that the baseline Whisper model performs poorly on single-word speech utterances. Nevertheless, fine-tuning Whisper significantly improves transcription accuracy (reducing Word Error Rate by 87.72% in healthy speech and 71.22% in speech from patients). Further, learned representations from the model enable accurate prediction of speech quality (average F1 Macro of 0.74 for healthy, 0.75 for patients). However, evaluations on an unseen (TORGO) dataset reveal limited generalizability, highlighting the inability of Whisper to perform zero-shot transcription of single-word utterances on out-of-domain clinical speech and emphasizing the need to adapt models to specific clinical populations. While challenges remain in cross-domain generalization, these findings highlight the potential of foundation models, when appropriately fine-tuned, to advance automated speech and language assessment and rehabilitation for stroke-related impairments.

Title: Bob's Confetti: Phonetic Memorization Attacks in Music and Video Generation
Authors: Jaechul Roh, Zachary Novack, Yuefeng Peng, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Amir Houmansadr
Abstract: Generative AI systems for music and video commonly use text-based filters to prevent the regurgitation of copyrighted material. We expose a fundamental flaw in this approach by introducing Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting phonetic memorization. The APT attack replaces iconic lyrics with homophonic but semantically unrelated alternatives (e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"), preserving acoustic structure while altering meaning; we identify high-fidelity phonetic matches using CMU pronouncing dictionary. We demonstrate that leading Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) models like SUNO and YuE regenerate songs with striking melodic and rhythmic similarity to their copyrighted originals when prompted with these altered lyrics. More surprisingly, this vulnerability extends across modalities. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from a song, a Text-to-Video (T2V) model like Veo 3 reconstructs visual scenes from the original music video-including specific settings and character archetypes-despite the absence of any visual cues in the prompt. Our findings reveal that models memorize deep, structural patterns tied to acoustics, not just verbatim text. This phonetic-to-visual leakage represents a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models, rendering simple copyright filters ineffective and raising urgent concerns about the secure deployment of multimodal AI systems. Demo examples are available at our project page (this https URL).

Title: Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior
Authors: Peng N. Wang, Peter B. Luh, Xuesong Lu, Peter Sincak, Laura Pitukova
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.

Title: SimulMEGA: MoE Routers are Advanced Policy Makers for Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Chenyang Le, Bing Han, Jinshun Li, Songyong Chen, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.

Title: Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Ian Nell, Shane Gilroy
Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behaviour classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviours such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioural analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Title: Dual-Regularized Riccati Recursions for Interior-Point Optimal Control
Authors: João Sousa-Pinto, Dominique Orban
Abstract: We derive closed-form extensions of Riccati's recursions (both sequential and parallel) for solving dual-regularized LQR problems. We show how these methods can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We provide MIT-licensed implementations of our methods in C++ and JAX.

Title: AL-CoLe: Augmented Lagrangian for Constrained Learning
Authors: Ignacio Boero, Ignacio Hounie, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations, Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Title: Quantifying Multimodal Imbalance: A GMM-Guided Adaptive Loss for Audio-Visual Learning
Authors: Zhaocheng Liu, Zhiwen Yu, Xiaoqing Liu
Abstract: The heterogeneity of multimodal data leads to inconsistencies and imbalance, allowing a dominant modality to steer gradient updates. Existing solutions mainly focus on optimization- or data-based strategies but rarely exploit the information inherent in multimodal imbalance or conduct its quantitative analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel quantitative analysis framework for Multimodal Imbalance and design a sample-level adaptive loss function. We define the Modality Gap as the Softmax score difference between modalities for the correct class and model its distribution using a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), representing balanced and imbalanced samples. Using Bayes' theorem, we estimate each sample's posterior probability of belonging to these two groups. Based on this, our adaptive loss (1) minimizes the overall Modality Gap, (2) aligns imbalanced samples with balanced ones, and (3) adaptively penalizes each according to its imbalance degree. A two-stage training strategy-warm-up and adaptive phases,yields state-of-the-art performance on CREMA-D (80.65%), AVE (70.40%), and KineticSound (72.42%). Fine-tuning with high-quality samples identified by the GMM further improves results, highlighting their value for effective multimodal fusion.

Title: Caption-Driven Explainability: Probing CNNs for Bias via CLIP

Schuster (Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences, Rapperswil, St. Gallen, Switzerland), Aggelos K. Katsaggelos (Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States)
Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.
