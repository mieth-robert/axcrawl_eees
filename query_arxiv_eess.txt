Title: Toward Responsible ASR for African American English Speakers: A Scoping Review of Bias and Equity in Speech Technology
Authors: Jay L. Cunningham, Adinawa Adjagbodjou, Jeffrey Basoah, Jainaba Jawara, Kowe Kadoma, Aaleyah Lewis
Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English (AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44 peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation, annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing, our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

Title: EAI-Avatar: Emotion-Aware Interactive Talking Head Generation
Authors: Haijie Yang, Zhenyu Zhang, Hao Tang, Jianjun Qian, Jian Yang
Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.

Title: Fast Multiagent Formation Stabilization with Sparse Universally Rigid Frameworks
Authors: Zhonggang Li, Geert Leus, Raj Thilak Rajan
Abstract: Affine formation control (AFC) is a distributed networked control system that has recently received increasing attention in various applications. AFC is typically achieved using a generalized consensus system where the stress matrix, which encodes the graph structure, is used instead of a graph Laplacian. Universally rigid frameworks (URFs) guarantee the existence of the stress matrix and have thus become the guideline for such a network design. In this work, we propose a convex optimization framework to design the stress matrix for AFC without predefining a rigid graph. We aim to find a resulting network with a reduced number of communication links, but still with a fast convergence speed. We show through simulations that our proposed solutions can yield a more sparse graph, while admitting a faster convergence compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.

Title: A Learning-based Hybrid System Approach for Detecting Contingencies in Distribution Grids with Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari
Abstract: This paper presents a machine-learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) modeling framework to detect contingencies in active distribution networks populated with inverter-based resources (IBRs). In particular, this framework allows detecting unobservable contingencies, which cannot be identified by normal sensing systems. First, a state-space SHS model combining conventional and IRB-based resources is introduced to formulate the dynamic interaction between continuous states of distribution networks and discrete contingency events. This model forms a randomly switching system, where parameters or network topology can change due to contingencies. We consider two contingency classes: (i) physical events, such as line outages, and (ii) measurement anomalies caused by sensor faults. Leveraging multivariate time series data derived from high-frequency sampling of system states and network outputs, a time series-based learning model is trained for real-time contingency detection and classification. Simulation studies, carried out on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system, demonstrate a 96% overall detection accuracy.

Title: Electromagnetic Formation Flying Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces and Control Barrier Functions for State and Input Constraints
Authors: Sumit S. Kamat, T. Michael Seigler, Jesse B. Hoagg
Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs. The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation control method in numerical simulations.

Title: Fuzzy-Based Control Method for Autonomous Spacecraft Inspection with Minimal Fuel Consumption
Authors: Daegyun Choi, Donghoon Kim, Henzeh Leeghim
Abstract: This study explores an energy-efficient control strategy for spacecraft inspection using a fuzzy inference system combined with a bio-inspired optimization technique to incorporate learning capability into the control process. The optimized fuzzy controller produces a minimally fuel-consuming force while maintaining reliable inspection within constraints, such as illumination, restricted field of view, thrust limits, and safe regions. The performance of the proposed control strategy is validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Scalable Fairness Shaping with LLM-Guided Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Peer-to-Peer Electricity Markets
Authors: Shrenik Jadhav, Birva Sevak, Srijita Das, Akhtar Hussain, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid (FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability. Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient, socially equitable, and technically sound.

Title: Stress-testing cross-cancer generalizability of 3D nnU-Net for PET-CT tumor segmentation: multi-cohort evaluation with novel oesophageal and lung cancer datasets
Authors: Soumen Ghosh, Christine Jestin Hannan, Rajat Vashistha, Parveen Kundu, Sandra Brosda, Lauren G.Aoude, James Lonie, Andrew Nathanson, Jessica Ng, Andrew P. Barbour, Viktor Vegh
Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners, and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort) and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms. Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7). The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung (52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

Title: ModAn-MulSupCon: Modality-and Anatomy-Aware Multi-Label Supervised Contrastive Pretraining for Medical Imaging
Authors: Eichi Takaya, Ryusei Inamori
Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations. Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector. A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN, 16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss, and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound). Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL (0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear separability. Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

Title: A Synoptic Review of High-Frequency Oscillations as a Biomarker in Neurodegenerative Disease
Authors: Samin Yaser, Mahad Ali, Laura J. Brattain, Yang Jiang, VP Nguyen, Jing Xiang
Abstract: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.

Title: Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity-based Control of Power Converters: Simulation and Experimental Results
Authors: Alessio Moreschini, Wei He, Romeo Ortega, Yiheng Lu, Tao Li
Abstract: The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.

Title: SkyTrust: Blockchain-Enhanced UAV Security for NTNs with Dynamic Trust and Energy-Aware Consensus
Authors: Afan Ali, Irfanullah Khan
Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust, present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model. Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and scalable solution to secure NTNs.

Title: Near-Field Challenges in Ultra-Wideband ISAC: Beamforming Strategies and System Insights
Authors: Yonghwi Kim, Sang-Hyun Park, Siyun Yang, Kai-Kit Wong, Linglong Dai, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: The shift toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks places integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) at the core of future applications such as autonomous driving, extended reality, and smart manufacturing. However, the combination of large antenna arrays and ultra-wide bandwidths brings near-field propagation effects and beam squint to the forefront, fundamentally challenging traditional far-field designs. True time delay units (TTDs) offer a potential solution, but their cost and hardware complexity limit scalability. In this article, we present practical beamforming strategies for near-field ultra-wideband ISAC systems. We explore codebook designs across analog and digital domains that mitigate beam squint, ensure reliable user coverage, and enhance sensing accuracy. We further validate these approaches through large-scale system-level simulations, including 3D map-based evaluations that reflect real-world urban environments. Our results demonstrate how carefully designed beamforming can balance communication throughput with sensing performance, achieving reliable coverage and efficient resource use even under severe near-field conditions. We conclude by highlighting open challenges in hardware, algorithms, and system integration, pointing toward research directions that will shape the deployment of 6G-ready ISAC networks.

Title: Closed-Form Input Design for Identification under Output Feedback with Perturbation Constraints
Authors: Jingwei Hu, Dave Zachariah, Torbjörn Wigren, Petre Stoica
Abstract: In many applications, system identification experiments must be performed under output feedback to ensure safety or to maintain system operation. In this paper, we consider the online design of informative experiments for ARMAX models by applying a bounded perturbation to the input signal generated by a fixed output feedback controller. Specifically, the design constrains the resulting output perturbation within user-specified limits and can be efficiently computed in closed form. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in two numerical experiments.

Title: On the Application of Diffusion Models for Simultaneous Denoising and Dereverberation
Authors: Adrian Meise, Tobias Cord-Landwehr, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach
Abstract: Diffusion models have been shown to achieve natural-sounding enhancement of speech degraded by noise or reverberation. However, their simultaneous denoising and dereverberation capability has so far not been studied much, although this is arguably the most common scenario in a practical application. In this work, we investigate different approaches to enhance noisy and/or reverberant speech. We examine the cascaded application of models, each trained on only one of the distortions, and compare it with a single model, trained either solely on data that is both noisy and reverberated, or trained on data comprising subsets of purely noisy, of purely reverberated, and of noisy reverberant speech. Tests are performed both on artificially generated and real recordings of noisy and/or reverberant data. The results show that, when using the cascade of models, satisfactory results are only achieved if they are applied in the order of the dominating distortion. If only a single model is desired that can operate on all distortion scenarios, the best compromise appears to be a model trained on the aforementioned three subsets of degraded speech data.

Title: DIFNet: Decentralized Information Filtering Fusion Neural Network with Unknown Correlation in Sensor Measurement Noises
Authors: Ruifeng Dong, Ming Wang, Ning Liu, Tong Guo, Jiayi Kang, Xiaojing Shen, Yao Mao
Abstract: In recent years, decentralized sensor networks have garnered significant attention in the field of state estimation owing to enhanced robustness, scalability, and fault tolerance. Optimal fusion performance can be achieved under fully connected communication and known noise correlation structures. To mitigate communication overhead, the global state estimation problem is decomposed into local subproblems through structured observation model. This ensures that even when the communication network is not fully connected, each sensor can achieve locally optimal estimates of its observable state components. To address the degradation of fusion accuracy induced by unknown correlations in measurement noise, this paper proposes a data-driven method, termed Decentralized Information Filter Neural Network (DIFNet), to learn unknown noise correlations in data for discrete-time nonlinear state space models with cross-correlated measurement noises. Numerical simulations demonstrate that DIFNet achieves superior fusion performance compared to conventional filtering methods and exhibits robust characteristics in more complex scenarios, such as the presence of time-varying noise. The source code used in our numerical experiment can be found online at this https URL.

Authors: Mahmoud Dhimish
Abstract: Thermal anomaly detection in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is essential for ensuring operational efficiency and reducing maintenance costs. In this study, we developed and named HOTSPOT-YOLO, a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates an efficient convolutional neural network backbone and attention mechanisms to improve object detection. This model is specifically designed for drone-based thermal inspections of PV systems, addressing the unique challenges of detecting small and subtle thermal anomalies, such as hotspots and defective modules, while maintaining real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate a mean average precision of 90.8%, reflecting a significant improvement over baseline object detection models. With a reduced computational load and robustness under diverse environmental conditions, HOTSPOT-YOLO offers a scalable and reliable solution for large-scale PV inspections. This work highlights the integration of advanced AI techniques with practical engineering applications, revolutionizing automated fault detection in renewable energy systems.

Title: A Framework for Robust Speaker Verification in Highly Noisy Environments Leveraging Both Noisy and Enhanced Audio
Authors: Adam Katav, Yair Moshe, Israel Cohen
Abstract: Recent advancements in speaker verification techniques show promise, but their performance often deteriorates significantly in challenging acoustic environments. Although speech enhancement methods can improve perceived audio quality, they may unintentionally distort speaker-specific information, which can affect verification accuracy. This problem has become more noticeable with the increasing use of generative deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech enhancement. While these networks can produce intelligible speech even in conditions of very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), they may also severely alter distinctive speaker characteristics. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel neural network framework that effectively combines speaker embeddings extracted from both noisy and enhanced speech using a Siamese architecture. This architecture allows us to leverage complementary information from both sources, enhancing the robustness of speaker verification under severe noise conditions. Our framework is lightweight and agnostic to specific speaker verification and speech enhancement techniques, enabling the use of a wide range of state-of-the-art solutions without modification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework.

Title: Performance Analysis of Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Using O-RIS and Fiber Optic Backhaul (Extended version)
Authors: Aboozar Heydaribeni, Hamzeh Beyranvand
Abstract: This Letter presents a novel hybrid underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system that integrates underwater optical access points (UOAPs) with a passive optical network (PON)-based fiber-optic backhaul to provide a resilient backbone. A hard switching mechanism is employed between direct and optical reconfigurable intelligent surface (O-RIS)-assisted links to ensure reliable connectivity. Unlike previous studies, the proposed system is evaluated under both active and multiple passive O-RIS configurations. To enhance reliability, the Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) schemes are applied. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that optimal O-RIS placement significantly enhances system performance. However, in the linear regime, placing it too close to the receiver causes degradation due to increased path loss and beam jitter in an identical water type. Moreover, increasing the number of O-RIS elements within practical limits further improves overall system performance and enhances adaptability to variations in the underwater channel.

Title: Lossless 4:2:0 Screen Content Coding Using Luma-Guided Soft Context Formation
Authors: Hannah Och, André Kaup
Abstract: The soft context formation coder is a pixel-wise state-of-the-art lossless screen content coder using pattern matching and color palette coding in combination with arithmetic coding. It achieves excellent compression performance on screen content images in RGB 4:4:4 format with few distinct colors. In contrast to many other lossless compression methods, it codes entire color pixels at once, i.e., all color components of one pixel are coded together. Consequently, it does not natively support image formats with downsampled chroma, such as YCbCr 4:2:0, which is an often used chroma format in video compression. In this paper, we extend the soft context formation coding capabilities to 4:2:0 image compression, by successively coding Y and CbCr planes based on an analysis of normalized mutual information between image planes. Additionally, we propose an enhancement to the chroma prediction based on the luminance plane. Furthermore, we propose to transmit side-information about occurring luma-chroma combinations to improve chroma probability distribution modelling. Averaged over a large screen content image dataset, our proposed method outperforms HEVC-SCC, with HEVC-SCC needing 5.66% more bitrate compared to our method.

Title: MOSA: Mixtures of Simple Adapters Outperform Monolithic Approaches in LLM-based Multilingual ASR
Authors: Junjie Li, Jing Peng, Yangui Fang, Shuai Wang, Kai Yu
Abstract: End-to-end multilingual ASR aims to transcribe speech from different languages into corresponding text, but is often limited by scarce multilingual data. LLM-based ASR aligns speech encoder outputs with LLM input space via a projector and has achieved notable success. However, prior work mainly improves performance by increasing data, with little focus on cross-lingual knowledge sharing. Moreover, a single complex projector struggles to capture both shared and language-specific features effectively. In this work, we propose MOSA (Mixture of Simple Adapters), leveraging a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism to combine lightweight adapters that learn shared and language-specific knowledge. This enables better utilization of high-resource language data to support low-resource languages, mitigating data scarcity issues. Experimental results show that MOSA-Base achieves a 15.4\% relative reduction in average WER compared to the Baseline-Base and consistently outperforms it across all languages. Remarkably, MOSA-Base surpasses the Baseline-Base even when trained with only 60\% of its parameters. Similarly, MOSA-Large outperforms the Baseline-Large in average WER and demonstrates greater robustness to data imbalance. Ablation studies further indicate that MOSA is more effective at handling individual languages and learning both language-specific and shared linguistic knowledge. These findings support that, in LLM-based ASR, a mixture of simple adapters is more effective than a single, complex adapter design.

Title: Beyond-Diagonal RIS: Adversarial Channels and Optimality of Low-Complexity Architectures
Authors: Atso Iivanainen, Robin Rajamäki, Visa Koivunen
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) have recently gained attention as an enhancement to conventional RISs. BD-RISs allow optimizing not only the phase, but also the amplitude responses of their discrete surface elements by introducing adjustable inter-element couplings. Various BD-RIS architectures have been proposed to optimally trade off between average performance and complexity of the architecture. However, little attention has been paid to worst-case performance. This paper characterizes novel sets of adversarial channels for which certain low-complexity BD-RIS architectures have suboptimal performance in terms of received signal power at an intended communications user. Specifically, we consider two recent BD-RIS models: the so-called group-connected and tree-connected architecture. The derived adversarial channel sets reveal new surprising connections between the two architectures. We validate our analytical results numerically, demonstrating that adversarial channels can cause a significant performance loss. Our results pave the way towards efficient BD-RIS designs that are robust to adversarial propagation conditions and malicious attacks.

Title: mmKey: Channel-Aware Beam Shaping for Reliable Key Generation in mmWave Wireless Networks
Authors: Poorya Mollahosseini, Yasaman Ghasempour
Abstract: Physical-layer key generation (PLKG) has emerged as a promising technique to secure next-generation wireless networks by exploiting the inherent properties of the wireless channel. However, PLKG faces fundamental challenges in the millimeter wave (mmWave) regime due to channel sparsity, higher phase noise, and higher path loss, which undermine both the randomness and reciprocity required for secure key generation. In this paper, we present mmKey, a novel PLKG framework that capitalizes on the availability of multiple antennas at mmWave wireless nodes to inject randomness into an otherwise quasi-static wireless channel. Different from prior works that sacrifice either the secrecy of the key generation or the robustness, mmKey balances these two requirements. In particular, mmKey leverages a genetic algorithm to gradually evolve the initial weight vector population toward configurations that suppress the LOS component while taking into account the channel conditions, specifically, the sparsity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Extensive simulations show that mmKey improves the secrecy gap by an average of 39.4% over random beamforming and 34.0% over null beamforming, outperforming conventional schemes.

Title: Fast Vortex Beam Alignment for OAM Mode Multiplexing in LOS MIMO Networks
Authors: Poorya Mollahosseini, Yasaman Ghasempour
Abstract: Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)-based communication systems offer high-capacity multiplexing in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios; yet, their performance is sensitive to nodal misalignment, which disrupts modal orthogonality, hindering the data multiplexing gain. To tackle this challenge, we present OrthoVortex, a novel framework that estimates the misalignment angles and applies the appropriate phase correction to restore orthogonality between modes. Unlike purely theoretical prior efforts that rely on impractical fully digital arrays or exhaustive beam scans, OrthoVortex introduces and leverages the cross-modal phase, as a unique signature for identifying the misalignment angles. OrthoVortex is a few-shot alignment technique, making it feasible for real-world implementations. Our key contributions include: (i) a robust angle estimation and phase correction framework based on the physics of OAM propagation that estimates the misalignment and restores modal orthogonality, (ii) the first-ever experimental validation of OAM beam alignment with RF transceivers, and (iii) a comprehensive analysis of practical constraints, including the impact of antenna count and bandwidth. Simulations and over-the-air measurements using low-cost, rapidly prototyped metasurfaces operating at 120 GHz demonstrate that OrthoVortex achieves fast and precise misalignment estimation (mean absolute error of $0.69^{\circ}$ for azimuth and $2.54^{\circ}$ for elevation angle). Further, OrthoVortex can mitigate the inter-modal interference, yielding more than 12 dB increase in signal-to-interference ratio and more than 4.5-fold improvement in link capacity.

Title: A Principled Framework to Evaluate Quality of AC-OPF Datasets for Machine Learning: Benchmarking a Novel, Scalable Generation Method
Authors: Matteo Baù (1), Luca Perbellini (2), Samuele Grillo (2) ((1) Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico, (2) Politecnico di Milano)
Abstract: Several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the quality of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) datasets used in machine learning (ML) models. Yet, scalability to large power systems remains unaddressed and comparing generation approaches is still hindered by the absence of widely accepted metrics quantifying AC-OPF dataset quality. In this work, we tackle both these limitations. We provide a simple heuristic that samples load setpoints uniformly in total load active power, rather than maximizing volume coverage, and solves an AC-OPF formulation with load slack variables to improve convergence. For quality assessment, we formulate a multi-criteria framework based on three metrics, measuring variability in the marginal distributions of AC-OPF primal variables, diversity in constraint activation patterns among AC-OPF instances and activation frequency of variable bounds. By comparing four open-source methods based on these metrics, we show that our heuristic consistently outperforms uniform random sampling, whether independent or constrained to a convex polytope, scoring as best in terms of balance between dataset quality and scalability.

Title: CLEAR: Continuous Latent Autoregressive Modeling for High-quality and Low-latency Speech Synthesis
Authors: Chun Yat Wu, Jiajun Deng, Guinan Li, Qiuqiang Kong, Simon Lui
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as powerful solutions for zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, capable of generating natural speech from a few seconds of audio prompts. However, conventional AR-based TTS systems relying on discrete audio tokens face the challenge of lossy compression during tokenization, requiring longer discrete token sequences to capture the same information as continuous ones, which adds inference latency and complicates AR modeling. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Continuous Latent Autoregressive model (CLEAR), a unified zero-shot TTS framework that directly models continuous audio representations. More specifically, CLEAR introduces an enhanced variational autoencoder with shortcut connections, which achieves a high compression ratio to map waveforms into compact continuous latents. A lightweight MLP-based rectified flow head that operates independently for each hidden state is presented to model the continuous latent probability distribution, and trained jointly with the AR model within a single-stage framework. Experiments show that the proposed zero-shot CLEAR TTS can synthesize high-quality speech with low latency. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTS models, CLEAR delivers competitive performance in robustness, speaker similarity and naturalness, while offering a lower real-time factor (RTF). In particular, CLEAR achieves SOTA results on the LibriSpeech test-clean dataset, with a word error rate of 1.88\% and an RTF of 0.29. Moreover, CLEAR facilitates streaming speech synthesis with a first-frame delay of 96ms, while maintaining high-quality speech synthesis.

Title: Random forest-based out-of-distribution detection for robust lung cancer segmentation
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Title: Space-Time Coded RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems with Practical Reflection Models: Error Rate Analysis and Negative Moment-Based Optimization with Saddle Point Approximation
Authors: Tayfun Yilmaz, Haci Ilhan, Ibrahim Hokelek
Abstract: RIS-assisted communication has recently attracted significant attention for enhancing wireless performance in challenging environments, making accurate error analysis under practical hardware constraints crucial for future multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a theoretical framework for SER analysis of RIS-assisted multiple antenna systems employing OSTBC under practical reflection models with amplitude-dependent and quantized phase responses. By exploiting the Gramian structure of the cascaded channel f, we derive exact MGF expressions of the nonzero eigenvalue of f'f for small RIS sizes. For large-scale RIS deployments, where closed-form analysis becomes intractable, we employ Saddle Point Approximation to approximate the eigenvalue distribution. Using these results, we derive unified SER expressions using exact and SPA-based MGF formulations, applicable to arbitrary RIS sizes, phase configuration, and both identical and non-identical amplitude responses. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the proposed SER expressions, demonstrating very close agreement for all configurations.

Title: Learning Interior Point Method for AC and DC Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian, Ramachandran Vaidyanathan
Abstract: This paper proposes a feasibility-guaranteed learning interior point method (L-IPM) to solve both AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Given the criticality of OPF, the proposed L-IPM uses a hybrid learning model approach rather than relying solely on a simple black-box prediction. The traditional IPM follows a central path from an initial point to the optimal solution. However, each iteration involves solving large linear systems, which becomes increasingly expensive as the matrices grow more ill-conditioned in later steps. To address this, we model the IPM trajectory as a time series and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to project the IPM central path using only the first few stable iterations, which carry the most informative features about the path to optimality. We introduce a grid-informed methodology that enforces operational constraints on generation, voltage magnitudes, and line flows to ensure feasibility. The grid-informed LSTM serves as a tool for the IPM central path projection and, followed by a final IPM refinement step, significantly reduces the total number of iterations and time required for convergence. We use a sampling method to generate a wide range of load scenarios to improve generalization across diverse operating conditions, efficiently covering the power system's operational space. Simulation results on a 2869-bus European high-voltage transmission system show that the proposed L-IPM significantly reduces solution time by up to 94\%, while maintaining accuracy and feasibility of the solution. By leveraging early iterations and bypassing the final ill-conditioned and computationally demanding steps of traditional IPM, the proposed L-IPM reduces the number of required iterations by up to 85.5\%. Since solution feasibility is also guaranteed, L-IPM outperforms the conventional IPM in both computational efficiency and robustness.

Title: Safe Navigation under State Uncertainty: Online Adaptation for Robust Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Ersin Das, Rahal Nanayakkara, Xiao Tan, Ryan M. Bena, Joel W. Burdick, Paulo Tabuada, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Measurements and state estimates are often imperfect in control practice, posing challenges for safety-critical applications, where safety guarantees rely on accurate state information. In the presence of estimation errors, several prior robust control barrier function (R-CBF) formulations have imposed strict conditions on the input. These methods can be overly conservative and can introduce issues such as infeasibility, high control effort, etc. This work proposes a systematic method to improve R-CBFs, and demonstrates its advantages on a tracked vehicle that navigates among multiple obstacles. A primary contribution is a new optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme that reduces the conservativeness of existing R-CBFs. In order to reduce the complexity of the parameter optimization, we merge several safety constraints into one unified numerical CBF via Poisson's equation. We further address the dual relative degree issue that typically causes difficulty in vehicle tracking. Experimental trials demonstrate the overall performance improvement of our approach over existing formulations.

Title: MDD: a Mask Diffusion Detector to Protect Speaker Verification Systems from Adversarial Perturbations
Authors: Yibo Bai, Sizhou Chen, Michele Panariello, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Massimiliano Todisco, Nicholas Evans
Abstract: Speaker verification systems are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. In this work, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial detection and purification framework based on a \textit{text-conditioned masked diffusion model}. During training, MDD applies partial masking to Mel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion process, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process then reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input transcription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial examples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD achieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, including both diffusion-based and neural codec-based approaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated speech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those observed under clean conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based masking strategies for secure and reliable speaker verification systems.

Title: Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS
Authors: Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at complexity that is only sublinear in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in performance and computational complexity over comparable baselines.

Title: Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space for Data Expansion
Authors: Tianchi Liu, Ruijie Tao, Qiongqiong Wang, Yidi Jiang, Hardik B. Sailor, Ke Zhang, Jingru Lin, Haizhou Li
Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However, collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE (Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\% relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification, where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable addition to existing training pipelines.

Title: Is Green Enough? A Remote Sensing Assessment of Environmental Impacts and Green Commitments at Beijing Daxing International Airport
Authors: Haorui Wang, Bo Zhao
Abstract: Beijing Daxing International Airport has been promoted as a model of green infrastructure under China's ecological modernization agenda. Featuring energy-efficient design, renewable energy systems, and smart environmental controls, the airport embodies multiple green commitments. This study evaluates its environmental outcomes using multi-source remote sensing data -- including NDVI, NDBI, Land Surface Temperature (LST), VIIRS night-time lights, and PM2.5 -- from 2014 to 2019. Through spatial and temporal comparisons, we assess landscape-level changes during and after construction. Findings indicate partial gains from green initiatives but also reveal substantial vegetation loss, increased built-up surfaces, and intensified surface temperatures. The results suggest a gap between sustainable design and ecological impact. We propose a remote-sensing-based framework for evaluating future infrastructure projects, emphasizing the need for spatially explicit, independent monitoring to ensure environmental accountability.

Title: Multi-Modal Drift Forecasting of Leeway Objects via Navier-Stokes-Guided CNN and Sequence-to-Sequence Attention-Based Models
Authors: Rahmat K. Adesunkanmi, Alexander W. Brandt, Masoud Deylami, Gustavo A. Giraldo Echeverri, Hamidreza Karbasian, Adel Alaeddini
Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities, object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$, $3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime conditions.

Title: ZTFed-MAS2S: A Zero-Trust Federated Learning Framework with Verifiable Privacy and Trust-Aware Aggregation for Wind Power Data Imputation
Authors: Yang Li, Hanjie Wang, Yuanzheng Li, Jiazheng Li, Zhaoyang Dong
Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange. These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in the energy sector.

Authors: Kérian Fiter, Louis Malassigné-Onfroy, Bentley Oakes
Abstract: With Digital Twin (DT) construction and evolution occurring over time, stakeholders require tools to understand the current characteristics and conceptual architecture of the system at any time. We introduce DTInsight, a systematic and automated tool and methodology for producing continuous reporting for DTs. DTInsight offers three key features: (a) an interactive conceptual architecture visualization of DTs; (b) generation of summaries of DT characteristics based on ontological data; and (c) integration of these outputs into a reporting page within a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Given a modeled description of the DT aligning to our DT Description Framework (DTDF), DTInsight enables up-to-date and detailed reports for enhanced stakeholder understanding.

Authors: Pierre-Emmanuel Goffi, Raphaël Tremblay, Bentley Oakes
Abstract: Successfully engineering interactive industrial DTs is a complex task, especially when implementing services beyond passive monitoring. We present here an experience report on engineering a safety-critical digital twin (DT) for beer fermentation monitoring, which provides continual sampling and reduces manual sampling time by 91%. We document our systematic methodology and practical solutions for implementing bidirectional DTs in industrial environments. This includes our three-phase engineering approach that transforms a passive monitoring system into an interactive Type 2 DT with real-time control capabilities for pressurized systems operating at seven bar. We contribute details of multi-layered safety protocols, hardware-software integration strategies across Arduino controllers and Unity visualization, and real-time synchronization solutions. We document specific engineering challenges and solutions spanning interdisciplinary integration, demonstrating how our use of the constellation reporting framework facilitates cross-domain collaboration. Key findings include the critical importance of safety-first design, simulation-driven development, and progressive implementation strategies. Our work thus provides actionable guidance for practitioners developing DTs requiring bidirectional control in safety-critical applications.

Title: Mimicking associative learning of rats via a neuromorphic robot in open field maze using spatial cell models
Authors: Tianze Liu, Md Abu Bakr Siddique, Hongyu An
Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However, the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events. By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance. This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models, we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics for advancements in autonomous systems.

Title: Reformulations of Quadratic Programs for Lipschitz Continuity
Authors: Devansh R. Agrawal, Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Optimization-based controllers often lack regularity guarantees, such as Lipschitz continuity, when multiple constraints are present. When used to control a dynamical system, these conditions are essential to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the system's trajectory. Here we propose a general method to convert a Quadratic Program (QP) into a Second-Order Cone Problem (SOCP), which is shown to be Lipschitz continuous. Key features of our approach are that (i) the regularity of the resulting formulation does not depend on the structural properties of the constraints, such as the linear independence of their gradients; and (ii) it admits a closed-form solution, which is not available for general QPs with multiple constraints, enabling faster computation. We support our method with rigorous analysis and examples.

Title: Real-time 3D Visualization of Radiance Fields on Light Field Displays
Authors: Jonghyun Kim, Cheng Sun, Michael Stengel, Matthew Chan, Andrew Russell, Jaehyun Jung, Wil Braithwaite, Shalini De Mello, David Luebke
Abstract: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

Title: Joint Time-Position Statistics and Fisher Information in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels
Authors: Yun-Feng Lo, Yen-Chi Lee
Abstract: This letter presents a closed-form characterization of the joint distribution of first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with drift. Prior studies have investigated FAT modeling via inverse Gaussian distributions [1] and applied FAT statistics for parameter estimation and synchronization tasks [2], [3], while more recent work has characterized FAP for spatial channel analysis [4]. In contrast, we derive an explicit joint probability density function (PDF) under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Our result reveals a nontrivial coupling between arrival time and lateral position, generalizing known inverse Gaussian models. We further compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to key channel parameters, showing that the joint observation enables estimation of lateral drift and improves sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient -- capabilities not achievable with time-only or position-only models. This joint framework enhances the modeling and inference capabilities for molecular communication channels where spatial randomness itself carries non-negligible information.

Title: FALCON: Autonomous Cyber Threat Intelligence Mining with LLMs for IDS Rule Generation
Authors: Shaswata Mitra, Azim Bazarov, Martin Duclos, Sudip Mittal, Aritran Piplai, Md Rayhanur Rahman, Edward Zieglar, Shahram Rahimi
Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

Title: AgriChrono: A Multi-modal Dataset Capturing Crop Growth and Lighting Variability with a Field Robot
Authors: Jaehwan Jeong, Tuan-Anh Vu, Mohammad Jony, Shahab Ahmad, Md. Mukhlesur Rahman, Sangpil Kim, M. Khalid Jawed
Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages. We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions.

Title: Improving Noise Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Router-Gated Cross-Modal Feature Fusion
Authors: DongHoon Lim, YoungChae Kim, Dong-Hyun Kim, Da-Hee Yang, Joon-Hyuk Chang
Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Title: Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn with Coordinated TDMA on Real-Time Applications
Authors: Seungmin Lee, Changmin Lee, Si-Chan Noh, Joonsoo Lee
Abstract: Wi-Fi plays a crucial role in connecting electronic devices and providing communication services in everyday life. Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for LL traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.

Title: An optimistic planning algorithm for switched discrete-time LQR
Authors: Mathieu Granzotto, Romain Postoyan, Dragan Nešić, Jamal Daafouz, Lucian Buşoniu
Abstract: We introduce TROOP, a tree-based Riccati optimistic online planner, that is designed to generate near-optimal control laws for discrete-time switched linear systems with switched quadratic costs. The key challenge that we address is balancing computational resources against control performance, which is important as constructing near-optimal inputs often requires substantial amount of computations. TROOP addresses this trade-off by adopting an online best-first search strategy inspired by A*, allowing for efficient estimates of the optimal value function. The control laws obtained guarantee both near-optimality and stability properties for the closed-loop system. These properties depend on the planning depth, which determines how far into the future the algorithm explores and is closely related to the amount of computations. TROOP thus strikes a balance between computational efficiency and control performance, which is illustrated by numerical simulations on an example.

Title: Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators
Authors: Hong-Ye Hu, Abigail McClain Gomez, Liyuan Chen, Aaron Trowbridge, Andy J. Goldschmidt, Zachary Manchester, Frederic T. Chong, Arthur Jaffe, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Title: Adaptive control mechanisms in gradient descent algorithms
Authors: Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: The problem of designing adaptive stepsize sequences for the gradient descent method applied to convex and locally smooth functions is studied. We take an adaptive control perspective and design update rules for the stepsize that make use of both past (measured) and future (predicted) information. We show that Lyapunov analysis can guide in the systematic design of adaptive parameters striking a balance between convergence rates and robustness to computational errors or inexact gradient information. Theoretical and numerical results indicate that closed-loop adaptation guided by system theory is a promising approach for designing new classes of adaptive optimization algorithms with improved convergence properties.

Title: Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning
Authors: Shervin Khalafi, Ignacio Hounie, Dongsheng Ding, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at this https URL.

Title: Real-time Testing of Satellite Attitude Control With a Reaction Wheel Hardware-In-the-Loop Platform
Authors: Morokot Sakal, George Nehma, Camilo Riano-Rios, Madhur Tiwari
Abstract: We propose the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test of an adaptive satellite attitude control system with reaction wheel health estimation capabilities. Previous simulations and Software-in-the-Loop testing have prompted further experiments to explore the validity of the controller with real momentum exchange devices in the loop. This work is a step toward a comprehensive testing framework for validation of spacecraft attitude control algorithms. The proposed HIL testbed includes brushless DC motors and drivers that communicate using a CAN bus, an embedded computer that executes control and adaptation laws, and a satellite simulator that produces simulated sensor data, estimated attitude states, and responds to actions of the external actuators. We propose methods to artificially induce failures on the reaction wheels, and present related issues and lessons learned.

Title: MOSformer: Momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer for medical image segmentation
Authors: De-Xing Huang, Xiao-Hu Zhou, Mei-Jiang Gui, Xiao-Liang Xie, Shi-Qi Liu, Shuang-Yi Wang, Zhen-Qiu Feng, Zhi-Chao Lai, Zeng-Guang Hou
Abstract: Medical image segmentation takes an important position in various clinical applications. 2.5D-based segmentation models bridge the computational efficiency of 2D-based models with the spatial perception capabilities of 3D-based models. However, existing 2.5D-based models primarily adopt a single encoder to extract features of target and neighborhood slices, failing to effectively fuse inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. In this study, a novel momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information from multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain consistent slice representations. Moreover, an inter-slice fusion transformer (IF-Trans) module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. MOSformer is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), achieving a new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% DSC, respectively. These results demonstrate MOSformer's competitiveness in medical image segmentation.

Title: Global Geolocated Realtime Data of Interfleet Urban Transit Bus Idling
Authors: Nicholas Kunz, H. Oliver Gao
Abstract: Urban transit bus idling is a contributor to ecological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes due to emissions. The global accumulation of this frequent pattern of undesirable driving behavior is enormous. In order to measure its scale, we propose GRD-TRT-BUF-4I (Ground Truth Buffer for Idling) an extensible, realtime detection system that records the geolocation and idling duration of urban transit bus fleets internationally. Using live vehicle locations from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime, the system detects approximately 200,000 idling events per day from over 50 cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. This realtime data was created dynamically to serve operational decision-making and fleet management to reduce the frequency and duration of idling events as they occur, as well as to capture its accumulative effects. Civil and Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, Epidemiologists, Policymakers, and other stakeholders might find this useful for emissions modeling, traffic management, route planning, and other urban sustainability efforts at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.

Title: DG-SED: Domain Generalization for Sound Event Detection with Heterogeneous Training Data
Authors: Yang Xiao, Han Yin, Jisheng Bai, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: This work explores domain generalization (DG) for sound event detection (SED), advancing adaptability to real-world scenarios. Our approach employs a mean-teacher framework with domain generalization named DG-SED to integrate heterogeneous training data while preserving the SED model performance across the datasets. Specifically, we first apply mixstyle to the frequency dimension to adapt the mel-spectrograms from different domains. Next, we use the adaptive residual normalization method to generalize features across multiple domains by applying instance normalization in the frequency dimension. Lastly, we use the sound event bounding boxes method for post-processing. We evaluate the proposed approach DG-SED on the DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 4, measuring PSDS on the DESED dataset and macro-average pAUC on the MAESTRO dataset. The results indicate that the proposed DG-SED method improves both PSDS and macro-average pAUC compared to the baselines. The code will be released in due course.

Title: Leveraging Content and Acoustic Representations for Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Soumya Dutta, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER), the task of identifying the expression of emotion from spoken content, is challenging due to the difficulty in extracting representations that capture emotional attributes from speech. The scarcity of labeled datasets further complicates the challenge where large models are prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose CARE (Content and Acoustic Representations of Emotions), where we design a dual encoding scheme which emphasizes semantic and acoustic factors of speech. While the semantic encoder is trained using distillation from utterance-level text representations, the acoustic encoder is trained to predict low-level frame-wise features of the speech signal. The proposed dual encoding scheme is a base-sized model trained only on unsupervised raw speech. With a simple light-weight classification model trained on the downstream task, we show that the CARE embeddings provide effective emotion recognition on a variety of datasets. We compare the proposal with several other self-supervised models as well as recent large-language model based approaches. In these evaluations, the proposed CARE is shown to be the best performing model based on average performance across 8 diverse datasets. We also conduct several ablation studies to analyze the importance of various design choices.

Title: Maximum-Likelihood Estimation Based on Diffusion Model For Wireless Communications
Authors: Changyuan Zhao, Jiacheng Wang, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Dong In Kim, Hongyang Du
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, with their powerful feature learning capabilities, have been applied in many fields. In mobile wireless communications, GenAI can dynamically optimize the network to enhance the user experience. Especially in signal detection and channel estimation tasks, due to digital signals following a certain random distribution, GenAI models can fully utilize their distribution learning characteristics. For example, diffusion models (DMs) and normalized flow models have been applied to related tasks. However, since the DM cannot guarantee that the generated results are the maximum-likelihood estimation points of the distribution during the data generation process, the successful task completion rate is reduced. Based on this, this paper proposes a Maximum-Likelihood Estimation Inference (MLEI) framework. The framework uses the loss function in the forward diffusion process of the DM to infer the maximum-likelihood estimation points in the discrete space. Then, we present a signal detection task in near-field communication scenarios with unknown noise characteristics. In experiments, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework has better performance than state-of-the-art signal estimators.

Title: TimeFlow: Temporal Conditioning for Longitudinal Brain MRI Registration and Aging Analysis
Authors: Bailiang Jian, Jiazhen Pan, Yitong Li, Fabian Bongratz, Ruochen Li, Daniel Rueckert, Benedikt Wiestler, Christian Wachinger
Abstract: Longitudinal brain analysis is essential for understanding healthy aging and identifying pathological deviations. Longitudinal registration of sequential brain MRI underpins such analyses. However, existing methods are limited by reliance on densely sampled time series, a trade-off between accuracy and temporal smoothness, and an inability to prospectively forecast future brain states. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \emph{TimeFlow}, a learning-based framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration. TimeFlow uses a U-Net backbone with temporal conditioning to model neuroanatomy as a continuous function of age. Given only two scans from an individual, TimeFlow estimates accurate and temporally coherent deformation fields, enabling non-linear extrapolation to predict future brain states. This is achieved by our proposed inter-/extra-polation consistency constraints applied to both the deformation fields and deformed images. Remarkably, these constraints preserve temporal consistency and continuity without requiring explicit smoothness regularizers or densely sampled sequential data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both future timepoint forecasting and registration accuracy. Moreover, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses by differentiating neurodegenerative trajectories from normal aging without requiring segmentation, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations and mitigating segmentation inconsistency. TimeFlow offers an accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free framework for longitudinal analysis of brain aging and chronic diseases, capable of forecasting brain changes beyond the observed study period.

Title: Stochastic Real-Time Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Games with Quadratic Payoffs
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: In multi-agent autonomous systems, deception is a fundamental concept which characterizes the exploitation of unbalanced information to mislead victims into choosing oblivious actions. This effectively alters the system's long term behavior, leading to outcomes that may be beneficial to the deceiver but detrimental to victim. We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) where players implement independent stochastic exploration signals to learn the pseudogradient flow. In particular, we show that deceptive players who obtain real-time measurements of other players' stochastic perturbation can incorporate this information into their own NES action update, consequentially steering the overall dynamics to a new operating point that could potentially improve the payoffs of the deceptive players. We consider games with quadratic payoff functions, as this restriction allows us to derive a more explicit formulation of the capabilities of the deceptive players. By leveraging results on multi-input stochastic averaging for dynamical systems, we establish local exponential (in probability) convergence for the proposed deceptive NES dynamics. To illustrate our results, we apply them to a two player quadratic game.

Title: Client-Aided Secure Two-Party Computation of Dynamic Controllers
Authors: Kaoru Teranishi, Takashi Tanaka
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a secure two-party computation protocol for dynamic controllers using a secret sharing scheme. The proposed protocol realizes outsourcing of controller computation to two servers, while controller parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are kept secret against the servers. Unlike previous encrypted controls in a single-server setting, the proposed method can operate a dynamic controller for an infinite time horizon without controller state decryption or input re-encryption. We show that the control performance achievable by the proposed protocol can be made arbitrarily close to that attained by the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, system-theoretic and cryptographic modifications of the protocol are presented to improve the communication complexity. The feasibility of the protocol is demonstrated through numerical examples of PID and observer-based controls.

Title: Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems
Authors: Darío Slaifstein (1), Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli (1), Laura Ramirez-Elizondo (1), Pavol Bauer (1) ((1) Delft University of Technology)
Abstract: In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to the nonlinear device dynamics, uncertainty, and computational issues. As such, energy management systems seek to decide the power dispatch in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). Current energy management uses empirical battery ageing models outside of their specific fitting conditions, resulting in inaccuracies and poor performance. Moreover, the link to thermal systems is also overlooked. This paper presents an ageing-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings that incorporates physics-based battery ageing models. The models distinguish between energy storage systems and make explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or stationary battery packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally, the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced with 35% grid cost observed savings, when passing from new to aged batteries in the summer.

Title: Image Coding for Machines via Feature-Preserving Rate-Distortion Optimization
Authors: Samuel Fernández-Menduiña, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega
Abstract: Many images and videos are primarily processed by computer vision algorithms, involving only occasional human inspection. When this content requires compression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, coding methods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance. We first show theoretically that an approach to reduce the effect of compression for a given task loss is to perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) using the distance between features, obtained from the original and the decoded images, as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such a rate-distortion objective is computationally impractical because it requires iteratively encoding and decoding the entire image-plus feature evaluation-for each possible coding configuration. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make the distortion term computable using block-based encoders. We first apply Taylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recasting the feature distance as a quadratic metric involving the Jacobian matrix of the neural network. Then, we replace the linearized metric with a block-wise approximation, which we call input-dependent squared error (IDSE). To make the metric computable, we approximate IDSE using sketches of the Jacobian. The resulting loss can be evaluated block-wise in the transform domain and combined with the sum of squared errors (SSE) to address both visual quality and computer vision performance. Simulations with AVC and HEVC across multiple feature extractors and downstream networks show up to 17 % bit-rate savings for the same task accuracy compared to RDO based on SSE, with no decoder complexity overhead and a small (7.86 %) encoder complexity increase.

Title: Sparsity-Promoting Reachability Analysis and Optimization of Constrained Zonotopes
Authors: Joshua A. Robbins, Jacob A. Siefert, Herschel C. Pangborn
Abstract: The constrained zonotope is a polytopic set representation widely used for set-based analysis and control of dynamic systems. This paper develops methods to formulate and solve optimization problems for dynamic systems in real time using constrained zonotope reachability analysis. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented that makes efficient use of the constrained zonotope structure. To increase the efficiency of the ADMM iterations, reachability calculations are presented that increase the sparsity of the matrices used to define a constrained zonotope when compared to typical methods. The developed methods are used to formulate and solve predictive control, state estimation, and safety verification problems. Numerical results show that optimization times using the proposed approach are competitive with state-of-the-art QP solvers and conventional problem formulations. A combined set-valued state estimation and moving horizon estimation algorithm is presented and experimentally demonstrated in the context of robot localization.

Title: Conformal Data-driven Control of Stochastic Multi-Agent Systems under Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Eleftherios E. Vlahakis, Lars Lindemann, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: We address control synthesis of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems under jointly chance-constrained collaborative signal temporal logic specifications in a distribution-free manner using available disturbance samples, which are partitioned into training and calibration sets. Leveraging linearity, we decompose each agent's system into deterministic nominal and stochastic error parts, and design disturbance feedback controllers to bound the stochastic errors by solving a tractable optimization problem over the training data. We then quantify prediction regions (PRs) for the aggregate error trajectories corresponding to agent cliques, involved in collaborative tasks, using conformal prediction and calibration data. This enables us to address the specified joint chance constraint via Lipschitz tightening and the computed PRs, and relax the centralized stochastic optimal control problem to a deterministic one, whose solution provides the feedforward inputs. To enhance scalability, we decompose the deterministic problem into agent-level subproblems solved in an MPC fashion, yielding a distributed control policy. Finally, we present an illustrative example and a comparison with [1].

Authors: Yanhui Hong, Nan Wang, Zhiyi Xia, Haoyi Tao, Xi Fang, Yiming Li, Jiankun Wang, Peng Jin, Xiaochen Cai, Shengyu Li, Ziqi Chen, Zezhong Zhang, Guolin Ke, Linfeng Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research. A online application is made available for researchers to access and evaluate the proposed automated analysis service.

Title: Revisiting SSL for sound event detection: complementary fusion and adaptive post-processing
Authors: Hanfang Cui, Longfei Song, Li Li, Dongxing Xu, Yanhua Long
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT, WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration, dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific fusion and robust SED system design.

Title: Deception in Oligopoly Games via Adaptive Nash Seeking Systems
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: In the theory of multi-agent systems, deception refers to the strategic manipulation of information to influence the behavior of other agents, ultimately altering the long-term dynamics of the entire system. Recently, this concept has been examined in the context of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) algorithms for noncooperative games. Specifically, it was demonstrated that players can exploit knowledge of other players' exploration signals to drive the system toward a ``deceptive" Nash equilibrium, while maintaining the stability of the closed-loop system. To extend this insight beyond the duopoly case, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive study of deception mechanisms in N-player oligopoly markets. By leveraging the structure of these games and employing stability techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems, we provide game-theoretic insights into deception and derive specialized results, including stability conditions. These results allow players to systematically adjust their NES dynamics by tuning gains and signal amplitudes, all while ensuring closed-loop stability. Additionally, we introduce novel sufficient conditions to demonstrate that the (practically) stable equilibrium point of the deceptive dynamics corresponds to a true Nash equilibrium of a different game, which we term the ``deceptive game." Our results show that, under the proposed adaptive dynamics with deception, a victim firm may develop a distorted perception of its competitors' product appeal, which could lead to setting suboptimal prices.

Title: Real-Time Sounding in ISAC networks: Design and Implementation of a Multi-Node Testbed with Synchronized Airborne and Ground-Based Sensors
Authors: Julia Beuster, Carsten Andrich, Sebastian Giehl, Marc Miranda, Lorenz Mohr, Dieter Novotny, Tom Kaufmann, Christian Schneider, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities become more prevalent in the mobile 6G radio landscape, there is a substantial opportunity to enhance situational awareness across diverse applications through multi-static radar sensing within meshed ISAC networks. To facilitate the development and testing of detection and localization algorithms across diverse scenarios, this paper introduces a synchronized distributed channel sounding testbed with airborne and ground-based multi-channel transceiver nodes with centimeter-level positioning accuracy enabled by real-time kinematic (RTK) and inertial navigation system (INS) data. Our modular experimental measurement system is designed to include stationary sensor nodes and light-weight to medium-weight mobile nodes deployable on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cars, pedestrians, and cyclists. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, specifically software defined radios (SDRs), the testbed encourages reproducibility in academic research laboratories. We detail the individual modules and integration steps required to achieve the specified performance. The testbed's capabilities are validated through a real-world measurement campaign, including stationary and flying sensor nodes, aimed at detecting radar targets such as vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircrafts, small hexacopters, cars and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios.

Title: Trajectory Optimization for UAV-Based Medical Delivery with Temporal Logic Constraints and Convex Feasible Set Collision Avoidance
Authors: Kaiyuan Chen, Yuhan Suo, Shaowei Cui, Yuanqing Xia, Wannian Liang, Shuo Wang
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.

Title: Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface
Authors: Suleman Rasheed, James Bennett, Peter E. Yoo, Anthony N. Burkitt, David B. Grayden
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.

Title: A Compact Dynamic Antenna for Physical Layer Wireless Security
Authors: Sheng Huang, Jacob R. Randall, Cory Hilton, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a $360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration. To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna system.

Title: MorphSAM: Learning the Morphological Prompts from Atlases for Spine Image Segmentation
Authors: Dingwei Fan, Junyong Zhao, Chunlin Li, Mingliang Wang, Qi Zhu, Haipeng Si, Daoqiang Zhang, Liang Sun
Abstract: Spine image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment of spine diseases. The complex structure of the spine and the high morphological similarity between individual vertebrae and adjacent intervertebral discs make accurate spine segmentation a challenging task. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed, it still struggles to effectively capture and utilize morphological information, limiting its ability to enhance spine image segmentation performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a MorphSAM that explicitly learns morphological information from atlases, thereby strengthening the spine image segmentation performance of SAM. Specifically, the MorphSAM includes two fully automatic prompt learning networks, 1) an anatomical prompt learning network that directly learns morphological information from anatomical atlases, and 2) a semantic prompt learning network that derives morphological information from text descriptions converted from the atlases. Then, the two learned morphological prompts are fed into the SAM model to boost the segmentation performance. We validate our MorphSAM on two spine image segmentation tasks, including a spine anatomical structure segmentation task with CT images and a lumbosacral plexus segmentation task with MR images. Experimental results demonstrate that our MorphSAM achieves superior segmentation performance when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Site-Specific Location Calibration and Validation of Ray-Tracing Simulator NYURay at Upper Mid-Band Frequencies
Authors: Mingjun Ying, Dipankar Shakya, Peijie Ma, Guanyue Qian, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins, enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

Title: Optimal Planning for Enhancing the Resilience of Modern Distribution Systems Against Cyberattacks
Authors: Armita Khashayardoost, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Deepa Kundur
Abstract: The increasing integration of IoT-connected devices in smart grids has introduced new vulnerabilities at the distribution level. Of particular concern is the potential for cyberattacks that exploit high-wattage IoT devices, such as EV chargers, to manipulate local demand and destabilize the grid. While previous studies have primarily focused on such attacks at the transmission level, this paper investigates their feasibility and impact at the distribution level. We examine how cyberattackers can target voltage-sensitive nodes, especially those exposed by the presence of high-consumption devices, to cause voltage deviation and service disruption. Our analysis demonstrates that conventional grid protections are insufficient against these intelligent, localized attacks. To address this, we propose resilience strategies using distributed generation (DGs), exploring their role in preemptive planning. This research highlights the urgent need for distribution-level cyber resilience planning in smart grids.

Title: Fusion of Modulation Spectrogram and SSL with Multi-head Attention for Fake Speech Detection
Authors: Rishith Sadashiv T N, Abhishek Bedge, Saisha Suresh Bore, Jagabandhu Mishra, Mrinmoy Bhattacharjee, S R Mahadeva Prasanna
Abstract: Fake speech detection systems have become a necessity to combat against speech deepfakes. Current systems exhibit poor generalizability on out-of-domain speech samples due to lack to diverse training data. In this paper, we attempt to address domain generalization issue by proposing a novel speech representation using self-supervised (SSL) speech embeddings and the Modulation Spectrogram (MS) feature. A fusion strategy is used to combine both speech representations to introduce a new front-end for the classification task. The proposed SSL+MS fusion representation is passed to the AASIST back-end network. Experiments are conducted on monolingual and multilingual fake speech datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model architecture in cross-dataset and multilingual cases. The proposed model achieves a relative performance improvement of 37% and 20% on the ASVspoof 2019 and MLAAD datasets, respectively, in in-domain settings compared to the baseline. In the out-of-domain scenario, the model trained on ASVspoof 2019 shows a 36% relative improvement when evaluated on the MLAAD dataset. Across all evaluated languages, the proposed model consistently outperforms the baseline, indicating enhanced domain generalization.

Title: Improving the Spectral Efficiency of Zak-OTFS via Mutually Unbiased Bases
Authors: Sandesh Rao Mattu, Nishant Mehrotra, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Orthogonal signaling or Nyquist signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in bandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$, the time-bandwidth product. Transmitting more than $BT$ symbols leads to loss of orthogonality. The standard approach is to reduce the symbol interval and resolve the resulting inter-symbol interference. This requires changing the sampling frequency and possibly the sampling clock. This paper shows that it is possible to improve spectral efficiency on doubly spread channels without changing the sampling frequency. The idea is to superimpose the information symbols using mutually unbiased bases (MUB) while maintaining the original spacing. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler domain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation as it allows construction of MUB. We also construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the doubly-spread channel. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in Gaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This reduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to further improve the bit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed signaling scheme using MUB achieves good bit-error performance.

Title: An Adaptive Environment-Aware Transformer Autoencoder for UAV-FSO with Dynamic Complexity Control
Authors: Han Zeng, Haibo Wang, Kan Wang, Xutao Yu, Zaichen Zhang
Abstract: The rise of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks sets high demands on UAV-assisted Free Space Optical (FSO) communications, where the channel environment becomes more complex and variable due to both atmospheric turbulence and UAV-induced vibrations. These factors increase the challenge of maintaining reliable communication and require adaptive processing methods. Autoencoders are promising as they learn optimal encodings from channel data. However, existing autoencoder designs are generic and lack the specific adaptability and computational flexibility needed for UAV-FSO scenarios. To address this, we propose AEAT-AE (Adaptive Environment-aware Transformer Autoencoder), a Transformer-based framework that integrates environmental parameters into both encoder and decoder via a cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, AEAT-AE incorporates a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that dynamically selects which layers of the Transformer autoencoder to activate based on real-time environmental inputs, effectively balancing performance and computational cost. Simulation results demonstrate that AEAT-AE outperforms conventional methods in bit error rate while maintaining efficient runtime, representing a novel tailored solution for next-generation UAV-FSO communications.

Title: Deshadow-Anything: When Segment Anything Model Meets Zero-shot shadow removal
Authors: Xiao Feng Zhang, Tian Yi Song, Jia Wei Yao
Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM), an advanced universal image segmentation model trained on an expansive visual dataset, has set a new benchmark in image segmentation and computer vision. However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.

Title: Contraction Properties of the Global Workspace Primitive
Authors: Michaela Ennis, Leo Kozachkov, Jean-Jacques Slotine
Abstract: To push forward the important emerging research field surrounding multi-area recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we expand theoretically and empirically on the provably stable RNNs of RNNs introduced by Kozachkov et al. in "RNNs of RNNs: Recursive Construction of Stable Assemblies of Recurrent Neural Networks". We prove relaxed stability conditions for salient special cases of this architecture, most notably for a global workspace modular structure. We then demonstrate empirical success for Global Workspace Sparse Combo Nets with a small number of trainable parameters, not only through strong overall test performance but also greater resilience to removal of individual subnetworks. These empirical results for the global workspace inter-area topology are contingent on stability preservation, highlighting the relevance of our theoretical work for enabling modular RNN success. Further, by exploring sparsity in the connectivity structure between different subnetwork modules more broadly, we improve the state of the art performance for stable RNNs on benchmark sequence processing tasks, thus underscoring the general utility of specialized graph structures for multi-area RNNs.

Title: Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading
Authors: David Schaurecker, David Wozabal, Nils Löhndorf, Thorsten Staake
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.

Title: Objective Task-based Evaluation of Quantitative Medical Imaging Methods: Emerging Frameworks and Future Directions
Authors: Yan Liu, Huitian Xia, Nancy A. Obuchowski, Richard Laforest, Arman Rahmim, Barry A. Siegel, Abhinav K. Jha
Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need, multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks in the context of PET.

Title: The Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem
Authors: Brycen D. Pearl, Joseph M. Miller, Hang Woon Lee
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOS) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOS, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOS are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.

Title: Large Language Model-Based Framework for Explainable Cyberattack Detection in Automatic Generation Control Systems
Authors: Muhammad Sharshar, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Davor Svetinovic, Amr M. Youssef, Deepa Kundur, Ehab F. El-Saadany
Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

Title: adder-viz: Real-Time Visualization Software for Transcoding Event Video
Authors: Andrew C. Freeman, Luke Reinkensmeyer
Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras, these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility. We previously proposed the unified ADDER representation to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the adder-viz software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a centralized repository at this https URL.

Title: EMO-Reasoning: Benchmarking Emotional Reasoning Capabilities in Spoken Dialogue Systems
Authors: Jingwen Liu, Kan Jen Cheng, Jiachen Lian, Akshay Anand, Rishi Jain, Faith Qiao, Robin Netzorg, Huang-Cheng Chou, Tingle Li, Guan-Ting Lin, Gopala Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical, and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive interactions.

Title: Realizing Reduced and Sparse Biochemical Reaction Networks from Dynamics
Authors: Maurice Filo, Mustafa Khammash
Abstract: We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.
