Title: A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing
Authors: Kaixuan Bao, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing (VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing (AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60% sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared to the traditional fixed-length methods.

Title: Traffic State Estimation in Congestion to Extend Applicability of DFOS
Authors: Yoshiyuki Yajima (1), Hemant Prasad (1), Daisuke Ikefuji (1), Hitoshi Sakurai (1), Manabu Otani (2) ((1) NEC Corporation, (2) Central Nippon Expressway Company, Limited.)
Abstract: This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases.

Title: Benchmarking Large Pretrained Multilingual Models on Québec French Speech Recognition
Authors: Coralie Serrand, Gilles Boulianne, Amira Morsli
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of large pretrained multilingual speech recognition models on a regional variety of French spoken in Québec, Canada, in terms of speed, word error rate and semantic accuracy. To this end we build a benchmark and evaluation pipeline based on the CommissionsQc datasets, a corpus of spontaneous conversations recorded during public inquiries recently held in Québec. Published results for these models on well-known benchmarks such as FLEURS or CommonVoice are not good predictors of the performance we observe on CommissionsQC. Our results should be of interest for practitioners interested in building speech applications for realistic conditions or regional language varieties.

Title: $H_\infty$ Performance Analysis for Almost Periodic Piecewise Linear Systems with Application to Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Control
Authors: Christopher Martin, Edward Kim, Enrique Velasquez, Wei Li, Dongmei Chen
Abstract: An almost periodic piecewise linear system (APPLS) is a type of piecewise linear system where the system cyclically switches between different modes, each with an uncertain but bounded dwell-time. Process regulation, especially disturbance rejection, is critical to the performance of these advanced systems. However, a method to guarantee disturbance rejection has not been developed. The objective of this study is to develop an $H_\infty$ performance analysis method for APPLSs, building on which an algorithm to synthesize practical $H_\infty$ controllers is proposed. As an application, the developed methods are demonstrated with an advanced manufacturing system -- roll-to-roll (R2R) dry transfer of two-dimensional materials and printed flexible electronics. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables a less conservative and much better performing $H_\infty$ controller compared with a baseline $H_\infty$ controller that does not account for the uncertain system switching structure.

Title: Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?
Authors: Abhijit Sinha, Hemant Kumar Kathania, Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech, accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64% relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of 10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the generalizability of the proposed approach.

Title: Zero-Shot KWS for Children's Speech using Layer-Wise Features from SSL Models
Authors: Subham Kutum, Abhijit Sinha, Hemant Kumar Kathania, Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri, Mahesh Chandra Govil
Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec. Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing, demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech. Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best, delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions. To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the distinct characteristics of child speakers.

Title: Deep Active Learning for Lung Disease Severity Classification from Chest X-rays: Learning with Less Data in the Presence of Class Imbalance
Authors: Roy M. Gabriel, Mohammadreza Zandehshahvar, Marly van Assen, Nattakorn Kittisut, Kyle Peters, Carlo N. De Cecco, Ali Adibi
Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from 963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6 board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification (normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1% of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance, maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

Title: Cooperative Sensing Enhanced UAV Path-Following and Obstacle Avoidance with Variable Formation
Authors: Changheng Wang, Zhiqing Wei, Wangjun Jiang, Haoyue Jiang, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: The high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables them to be used in various civilian fields, such as rescue and cargo transport. Path-following is a crucial way to perform these tasks while sensing and collision avoidance are essential for safe flight. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently and accurately achieve path-following, obstacle sensing and avoidance subtasks, as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion, based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.

Title: Cochleagram-based Noise Adapted Speaker Identification System for Distorted Speech
Authors: Sabbir Ahmed, Nursadul Mamun, Md Azad Hossain
Abstract: Speaker Identification refers to the process of identifying a person using one's voice from a collection of known speakers. Environmental noise, reverberation and distortion make the task of automatic speaker identification challenging as extracted features get degraded thus affecting the performance of the speaker identification (SID) system. This paper proposes a robust noise adapted SID system under noisy, mismatched, reverberated and distorted environments. This method utilizes an auditory features called cochleagram to extract speaker characteristics and thus identify the speaker. A $128$ channel gammatone filterbank with a frequency range from $50$ to $8000$ Hz was used to generate 2-D cochleagrams. Wideband as well as narrowband noises were used along with clean speech to obtain noisy cochleagrams at various levels of signal to noise ratio (SNR). Both clean and noisy cochleagrams of only $-5$ dB SNR were then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a speaker model in order to perform SID which is referred as noise adapted speaker model (NASM). The NASM was trained using a certain noise and then was evaluated using clean and various types of noises. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed system was tested using reverberated as well as distorted test data. Performance of the proposed system showed a measurable accuracy improvement over existing neurogram based SID system.

Title: Hybrid Codebook Design for Localization Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System
Authors: Alireza Fadakar, Yuchen Zhang, Hui Chen, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

Title: Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison
Authors: Niladri Halder, Chandra R. Murthy
Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels and similar receiver complexities. We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED) scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further improve the CE and data detection accuracy. Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications, interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these differences disappear.

Title: Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals
Authors: Hang Sheng, Hui Feng, Junhao Yu, Feng Ji, Bo Hu
Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real datasets.

Title: Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals
Authors: Hang Sheng, Qinji Shu, Hui Feng, Bo Hu
Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

Title: Fundamentals of Data-Driven Approaches to Acoustic Signal Detection, Filtering, and Transformation
Authors: Chao Pan
Abstract: In recent decades, the field of signal processing has rapidly evolved due to diverse application demands, leading to a rich array of scientific questions and research areas. The forms of signals, their formation mechanisms, and the information extraction methods vary by application, resulting in diverse signal processing techniques. Common techniques can be categorized into three types: transformation, detection, and filtering. Signal transformation converts signals from their original domain to a more suitable target domain for analysis; signal detection aims to identify the existence of relevant information within a signal and its specific time and location; and signal filtering focuses on extracting or separating source signals of interest from observed signals. In acoustic signal processing, techniques include sound source localization, sound event detection, voiceprint extraction and recognition, noise reduction, and source separation, with applications in speech communication, voice interaction, smart healthcare, and industrial diagnostics. Recently, the advancement of deep learning technologies has shifted methodologies in acoustic signal processing from knowledge-driven to data-driven approaches, leading to significant research outcomes. This paper aims to systematically summarize the principles and methods of data-driven acoustic signal processing, providing a comprehensive understanding framework for academic exploration and practical applications.

Title: Polynomial Closed Form Model for Ultra-Wideband Transmission Systems
Authors: Pierluigi Poggiolini, Yanchao Jiang, Yifeng Gao, Fabrizio Forghieri
Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing, optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM), improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario, including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under the Creative Commons 4.0 License.

Title: State and Input Constrained Model Reference Adaptive Control with Robustness and Feasibility Analysis
Authors: Poulomee Ghosh, Shubhendu Bhasin
Abstract: We propose a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) plants with user-defined state and input constraints in the presence of unmatched bounded disturbances. Unlike popular optimization-based approaches for constrained control, such as model predictive control (MPC) and control barrier function (CBF) that solve a constrained optimization problem at each step using the system model, our approach is optimization-free and adaptive; it combines a saturated adaptive controller with a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based design to ensure that the plant state and input always stay within pre-specified bounds despite the presence of unmatched disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that considers both state and input constraints for control of uncertain systems with disturbances and provides sufficient feasibility conditions to check for the existence of an admissible control policy. Simulation results, including a comparison with a robust MRAC, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Model Reference Adaptive Control with Time-Varying State and Input Constraints
Authors: Poulomee Ghosh, Shubhendu Bhasin
Abstract: This paper presents a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework for uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to user-defined, time-varying state and input constraints. The proposed design seamlessly integrates a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) to enforce state constraints with a time-varying saturation function to handle input limits. These time-varying constraints can be designed as performance functions to shape transient and steady-state behaviors for both state and input. A key contribution is the derivation of a verifiable, offline feasibility condition to check the existence of a valid control policy for a given set of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adaptive control methodology to simultaneously handle both time-varying state and input constraints without resorting to online optimization. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed constrained MRAC scheme.

Title: Adaptive Dead-Zone Dual Sliding Mode Observer for Reliable Electrochemical Model-Based SOC Estimation
Authors: Guangdi Hu, Keyi Liao, Jian Ye, Feng Guo
Abstract: Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.

Title: Energy Detection over Composite $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks
Authors: He Huang, Zeping Sui, Zilong Liu, Wei Huang, Md. Noor-A-Rahim, Haishi Wang, Zhiheng Hu
Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device average SNR.

Title: Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts
Authors: Fabian Raisch, Max Langtry, Felix Koch, Ruchi Choudhary, Christoph Goebel, Benjamin Tischler
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing. Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort. SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

Title: Towards Improved Speech Recognition through Optimized Synthetic Data Generation
Authors: Yanis Perrin, Gilles Boulianne
Abstract: Supervised training of speech recognition models requires access to transcribed audio data, which often is not possible due to confidentiality issues. Our approach to this problem is to generate synthetic audio from a text-only corpus using a state-of-the-art text-to-speech model with voice cloning capabilities. Our goal is to achieve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance comparable to models trained on real data. We explore ways to optimize synthetic data generation through finetuning, filtering and evaluation, and its use for training an end-to-end encoder-decoder ASR model. Experiments were conducted using two datasets of spontaneous, conversational speech in Québec French. We show that improving data generation leads to large improvements in the final ASR system trained on synthetic data.

Title: On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer
Authors: Amirhossein Azarbahram, Onel L. A. López, Petar Popovski, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii) antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile, the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular coverage.

Title: Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Haozhe Tian, Qiyu Rao, Nina Moutonnet, Pietro Ferraro, Danilo Mandic
Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram (ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Title: Chance-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow Using Constraint-Informed Statistical Estimation
Authors: Tianyang Yi, D. Adrian Maldonado, Anirudh Subramanyam
Abstract: Chance-constrained optimization has emerged as a promising framework for managing uncertainties in power systems. This work advances its application to the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) model, developing a novel approach to uncertainty modeling and estimation. Current methods typically tackle these problems by first modeling random nodal injections using high-dimensional statistical distributions that scale with the number of buses, followed by deriving deterministic reformulations of the probabilistic constraints. We propose an alternative methodology that exploits the constraint structure to inform the uncertainties to be estimated, enabling significant dimensionality reduction. Rather than learning joint distributions of net-load forecast errors across units, we instead directly model the one-dimensional aggregate system forecast error and two-dimensional line errors weighted by power transfer distribution factors. We evaluate our approach under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in statistical accuracy and optimization performance compared to existing methods.

Title: A Single Subject Machine Learning Based Classification of Motor Imagery EEGs
Authors: Dario Sanalitro, Marco Finocchiaro, Pasquale Memmolo, Emanuela Cutuli, Maide Bucolo
Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of (Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy

Title: Transferring the driveshaft inertia to the grid via the DC-link in MV drive systems
Authors: Catalin Arghir, Pieder Jörg, Silvia Mastellone
Abstract: This paper investigates a control approach that renders the driveshaft inertia completely available on the grid side and enhances the fault ride-through behavior of medium-voltage (MV) drive systems. Two main contributions are presented. First, we show how the rotational inertia of the driveline shaft can be synchronously coupled to the grid through a modification of the speed control reference signal and through an adapted DC-link control strategy. For the latter, we pursue two alternatives: one based on conventional cascaded control and another based on synchronous machine (SM) model matching. Second, we demonstrate that both the standard phase-locked loop (PLL) and the matching control approach can be interpreted, via the ray-circle complementarity, as feedback optimization schemes with distinct steady-state maps. This perspective allows us to revisit matching control, reveal its embedded PLL, highlight its current-limiting and tracking capabilities, and provide an extensive simulation study.

Title: DynaMark: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Watermarking in Industrial Machine Tool Controllers
Authors: Navid Aftabi, Abhishek Hanchate, Satish Bukkapatnam, Dan Li
Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions, underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by 70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings, rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding existing benchmarks.

Title: QuadKAN: KAN-Enhanced Quadruped Motion Control via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Allen Wang, Gavin Tao
Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.

Title: WaveLLDM: Design and Development of a Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model for Speech Enhancement and Restoration
Authors: Kevin Putra Santoso, Rizka Wakhidatus Sholikah, Raden Venantius Hari Ginardi
Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However, degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM (Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores (0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for future development.

Title: Observer Design for Optical Flow-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry with Almost-Global Convergence
Authors: Tarek Bouazza, Soulaimane Berkane, Minh-Duc Hua, Tarek Hamel
Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data. This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer, which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through simulation results.

Title: Remarks on stochastic cloning and delayed-state filtering
Authors: Tara Mina, Lindsey Marinello, John Christian
Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which augments the state vector to account for these correlations. This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for higher-dimensional states. Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements, demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more efficiently.

Title: On Zero-sum Game Representation for Replicator Dynamics
Authors: Haoyu Yin, Xudong Chen, Bruno Sinopoli
Abstract: Replicator dynamics have widely been used in evolutionary game theory to model how strategy frequencies evolve over time in large populations. The so-called payoff matrix encodes the pairwise fitness that each strategy obtains when interacting with every other strategy, and it solely determines the replicator dynamics. If the payoff matrix is unknown, we show in this paper that it cannot be inferred from observed strategy frequencies alone -- distinct payoff matrices can induce the same replicator dynamics. We thus look for a canonical representative of the payoff matrix in the equivalence class. The main result of the paper is to show that for every polynomial replicator dynamics (i.e., the vector field is a polynomial), there always exists a skew-symmetric, polynomial payoff matrix that can induce the given dynamics.

Title: Project-Based Learning in Introductory Quantum Computing Courses: A Case Study on Quantum Algorithms for Medical Imaging
Authors: Nischal Binod Gautam, Keith Evan Schubert, Enrique P. Blair
Abstract: Quantum computing introduces abstract concepts and non-intuitive behaviors that can be challenging for students to grasp through traditional lecture-based instruction alone. This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment also works better if students are required to write and submit a conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.

Title: A Fundamental Convergence Rate Bound for Gradient Based Online Optimization Algorithms with Exact Tracking
Authors: Alex Xinting Wu, Ian R. Petersen, Iman Shames
Abstract: In this paper, we consider algorithms with integral action for solving online optimization problems characterized by quadratic cost functions with a time-varying optimal point described by an $(n-1)$th order polynomial. Using a version of the internal model principle, the optimization algorithms under consideration are required to incorporate a discrete time $n$-th order integrator in order to achieve exact tracking. By using results on an optimal gain margin problem, we obtain a fundamental convergence rate bound for the class of linear gradient based algorithms exactly tracking a time-varying optimal point. This convergence rate bound is given by $ \left(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa} - 1 }{\sqrt{\kappa} + 1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number for the set of cost functions under consideration. Using our approach, we also construct algorithms which achieve the optimal convergence rate as well as zero steady-state error when tracking a time-varying optimal point.

Title: Multi-Modal Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Collision Avoidance
Authors: Alberto Bertipaglia, Dariu M. Gavrila, Barys Shyrokau
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles, outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

Title: Incremental Policy Iteration for Unknown Nonlinear Systems with Stability and Performance Guarantees
Authors: Qingkai Meng, Fenglan Wang, Lin Zhao
Abstract: This paper proposes a general incremental policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm for model-free robust optimal control of unknown nonlinear systems. The approach integrates recursive least squares estimation with linear ADP principles, which greatly simplifies the implementation while preserving adaptive learning capabilities. In particular, we develop a sufficient condition for selecting a discount factor such that it allows learning the optimal policy starting with an initial policy that is not necessarily stabilizing. Moreover, we characterize the robust stability of the closed-loop system and the near-optimality of iterative policies. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Faster Inference of Cell Complexes from Flows via Matrix Factorization
Authors: Til Spreuer, Josef Hoppe, Michael T. Schaub
Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and computational speed.

Title: A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Digraphs
Authors: Feng-Yu Yue, Daniel Zelazo
Abstract: This work presents a passivity-based analysis for the nonlinear output agreement problem in network systems over directed graphs. We reformulate the problem as a convergence analysis on the agreement submanifold. First, we establish how passivity properties of individual agents and controllers determine the passivity of their associated system relations. Building on this, we introduce the concept of submanifold-constrained passivity and develop a novel compensation theorem that ensures output convergence to the agreement submanifold. Unlike previous approaches, our approach can analyze the network system with arbitrary digraphs and any passive agents. We apply this framework to analyze the output agreement problem for network systems consisting of nonlinear and passive agents. Numerical examples support our results.

Title: Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning
Authors: Xinyi Sheng, Dominik Baumann
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable. In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate. To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms conventional RL methods.

Title: The Rosario Dataset v2: Multimodal Dataset for Agricultural Robotics
Authors: Nicolas Soncini, Javier Cremona, Erica Vidal, Maximiliano García, Gastón Castro, Taihú Pire
Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field, comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion blur, rough terrain, and long, perceptually aliased sequences. By addressing these complexities, the dataset aims to support the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms for localization, mapping, perception, and navigation in agricultural robotics. The platform and data collection system is designed to meet the key requirements for evaluating multi-modal SLAM systems, including hardware synchronization of sensors, 6-DOF ground truth and loops on long trajectories. We run multimodal state-of-the art SLAM methods on the dataset, showcasing the existing limitations in their application on agricultural settings. The dataset and utilities to work with it are released on this https URL.

Title: Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models
Authors: Grigory Neustroev, Diego A. Tejada-Arango, German Morales-Espana, Mathijs M. de Weerdt
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method -- hull clustering with blended RPs -- that enhances traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), enabling a more accurate approximation of the full time horizon with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.

Title: A Soft Inducement Framework for Incentive-Aided Steering of No-Regret Players
Authors: Asrin Efe Yorulmaz, Raj Kiriti Velicheti, Melih Bastopcu, Tamer Başar
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game, transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high probability, and support it with empirical results.

Title: A Dual Ensemble Kalman Filter Approach to Robust Control of Nonlinear Systems: An Application to Partial Differential Equations
Authors: Anant A. Joshi, Saviz Mowlavi, Mouhacine Benosman
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of data-driven robust control design for nonlinear systems, for instance, obtained when discretizing nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A robust learning control approach is developed for nonlinear affine in control systems based on Lyapunov redesign technique. The robust control is developed as a sum of an optimal learning control which stabilizes the system in absence of disturbances, and an additive Lyapunov-based robustification term which handles the effects of disturbances. The dual ensemble Kalman filter (dual EnKF) algorithm is utilized in the optimal control design methodology. A simulation study is done on the heat equation and Burgers partial differential equation.

Title: Entropy-Based Non-Invasive Reliability Monitoring of Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Amirhossein Nazeri, Wael Hafez
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However, existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time without compromising original model performance.

Title: SemHARQ: Semantic-Aware Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request for Multi-Task Semantic Communications
Authors: Jiangjing Hu, Fengyu Wang, Wenjun Xu, Hui Gao, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Intelligent task-oriented semantic communications~(SemComs) have witnessed great progress with the development of deep learning~(DL), where multi-task SemComs that perform multiple tasks simultaneously attach great importance due to its high efficiency. However, the study of robust multi-task-oriented semantics transmission is still in early stages. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware hybrid automatic repeat request~(SemHARQ) framework for the robust and efficient transmissions of multi-task semantic features. First, to improve the robustness and effectiveness of semantic coding, a multi-task semantic encoder is proposed. Meanwhile, a feature importance ranking~(FIR) method is investigated to ensure the important features delivery under limited channel resources. Then, to accurately detect the possible transmission errors, a novel feature distortion evaluation~(FDE) network is designed to identify the distortion level of each feature, based on which an efficient HARQ method is proposed. Specifically, the corrupted features are retransmitted, where the remaining channel resources are used for incremental transmissions. The system performance is evaluated under different channel conditions in multi-task scenarios in the Internet of Vehicles. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art works by more than $20\%$ in rank-1 accuracy for vehicle re-identification, and $10\%$ in vehicle color classification accuracy in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.

Title: Endmember Extraction from Hyperspectral Images Using Self-Dictionary Approach with Linear Programming
Authors: Tomohiko Mizutani
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. A key step in utilizing this technology is endmember extraction, which aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials in observed scenes. Theoretical studies suggest that self-dictionary methods using linear programming (LP), known as Hottopixx methods, are effective in extracting endmembers. However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures.

Title: Explicit Semantic-Base-Empowered Communications for 6G Mobile Networks
Authors: Fengyu Wang, Yuan Zheng, Wenjun Xu, Junxiao Liang, Ping Zhang, Zhu Han
Abstract: Increasing demands for massive data transmission pose significant challenges to communication systems. Compared with traditional communication systems that focus on the accurate reconstruction of bit sequences, SemComs, which aim to deliver information connotation, are regarded as a key technology for 6G mobile networks. Most current SemComs utilize an end-to-end trained NN for semantic extraction and interpretation, which lacks interpretability for further optimization. Moreover, NN-based SemComs assume that the application and physical layers of the protocol stack can be jointly trained, which is incompatible with current digital communication systems. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a SemCom system that employs explicit semantic bases (Sebs) as the basic units to represent semantic connotations. First, a mathematical model of Sebs is proposed to build an explicit KB. Then, the Seb-based SemCom architecture is proposed, including both a communication mode and a KB update mode to enable the evolution of communication systems. Sem-codec and channel codec modules are designed specifically, with the assistance of an explicit KB for the efficient and robust transmission of semantics. Moreover, UEP is strategically implemented, considering communication intent and the importance of Sebs, thereby ensuring the reliability of critical semantics. In addition, a Seb-based SemCom protocol stack that is compatible with the 5G protocol stack is proposed. To assess the effectiveness and compatibility of the proposed Seb-based SemComs, a case study focusing on an image-transmission task is conducted. The simulations show that our Seb-based SemComs outperform state-of-the-art works in LPIPS by over 20% under varying communication intents and exhibit robustness under fluctuating channel conditions, highlighting the advantages of the interpretability and flexibility afforded by explicit Sebs.

Title: Efficient Sparse Coding with the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech Classification
Authors: Soufiyan Bahadi, Eric Plourde, Jean Rouat
Abstract: Researchers are exploring novel computational paradigms such as sparse coding and neuromorphic computing to bridge the efficiency gap between the human brain and conventional computers in complex tasks. A key area of focus is neuromorphic audio processing. While the Locally Competitive Algorithm has emerged as a promising solution for sparse coding, offering potential for real-time and low-power processing on neuromorphic hardware, its applications in neuromorphic speech classification have not been thoroughly studied. The Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm builds upon the Locally Competitive Algorithm by dynamically adjusting the modulation parameters of the filter bank to fine-tune the filters' sensitivity. This adaptability enhances lateral inhibition, improving reconstruction quality, sparsity, and convergence time, which is crucial for real-time applications. This paper demonstrates the potential of the Locally Competitive Algorithm and its adaptive variant as robust feature extractors for neuromorphic speech classification. Results show that the Locally Competitive Algorithm achieves better speech classification accuracy at the expense of higher power consumption compared to the LAUSCHER cochlea model used for benchmarking. On the other hand, the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm mitigates this power consumption issue without compromising the accuracy. The dynamic power consumption is reduced to a range of 4 to 13 milliwatts on neuromorphic hardware, three orders of magnitude less than setups using Graphics Processing Units. These findings position the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm as a compelling solution for efficient speech classification systems, promising substantial advancements in balancing speech classification accuracy and power efficiency.

Title: Gaussian is All You Need: A Unified Framework for Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion Posterior Sampling
Authors: Nebiyou Yismaw, Ulugbek S. Kamilov, M. Salman Asif
Abstract: Diffusion models can generate a variety of high-quality images by modeling complex data distributions. Trained diffusion models can also be very effective image priors for solving inverse problems. Most of the existing diffusion-based methods integrate data consistency steps by approximating the likelihood function within the diffusion reverse sampling process. In this paper, we show that the existing approximations are either insufficient or computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose a unified likelihood approximation method that incorporates a covariance correction term to enhance the performance and avoids propagating gradients through the diffusion model. The correction term, when integrated into the reverse diffusion sampling process, achieves better convergence towards the true data posterior for selected distributions and improves performance on real-world natural image datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to factorize and invert the covariance matrix of the likelihood function for several inverse problems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over several existing approaches. Code available at this https URL.

Title: Semi-Blind Receivers for Hybrid Reflecting and Sensing RIS
Authors: Amarilton L. Magalhães, André L. F. de Almeida
Abstract: Recent research has delved into advanced designs for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with integrated sensing functions. One promising concept is the hybrid RIS (HRIS), which blends sensing and reflecting meta-atoms. This enables HRIS to process signals, aiding in channel estimation (CE) and symbol detection tasks. This paper formulates novel semi-blind receivers for HRIS-aided wireless communications that enable joint symbol and CE at the HRIS and BS. The proposed receivers exploit a tensor coding at the transmit side, while capitalizing on the multilinear structures of the received signals. We develop iterative and closed-form receiver algorithms for joint estimation of the uplink channels and symbols at both the HRIS and the BS, enabling joint channel and symbol estimation functionalities. The proposed receivers offer symbol decoding capabilities to the HRIS and ensure ambiguity-free separate CE without requiring an a priori training stage. We also study identifiability conditions that provide a unique joint channel and symbol recovery, and discuss the computational complexities and tradeoffs involved in the proposed semi-blind receivers. Our findings demonstrate the competitive performances of the proposed solutions at the HRIS and the BS and unveil distinct performance trends based on the possible combinations of HRIS-BS receiver pairs. Finally, extensive numerical results elucidate the interplay between power splitting, symbol recovery, and CE accuracy in HRIS-assisted communications. Such insights are pivotal for optimizing receiver design and enhancing system performance in future HRIS deployments.

Title: BrainGPT: Unleashing the Potential of EEG Generalist Foundation Model by Autoregressive Pre-training
Authors: Tongtian Yue, Xuange Gao, Shuning Xue, Yepeng Tang, Longteng Guo, Jie Jiang, Jing Liu
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are pivotal in providing insights into spontaneous brain activity, highlighting their significant importance in neuroscience research. However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications. The code and models will be released.

Title: Pulling Back Theorem for Generalizing the Diagonal Averaging Principle in Symplectic Geometry Mode Decomposition and Singular Spectrum Analysis
Authors: Hong-Yan Zhang, Haoting Liu, Zhi-Qiang Feng, Ci-Fei Dong, Rui-Jia Lin, Yu Zhou, Fu-Yun Li
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for analyzing time sequences. The SGMD is based on the upper conversion via embedding and down conversion via diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). However, there are two defects in the DAP: it just hold for the time delay $\tau=1$ in the trajectory matrix and it fails for the time sequence of type-1 with the form $X=\{x[n]\}^N_{n=1}$. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the inverse step for embedding is explored with binary Diophantine equation in number theory. The contributions of this work lie in three aspects: firstly, the pulling back theorem is proposed and proved, which state the general formula for converting the component of trajectory matrix to the component of time sequence for the general representation of time sequence and for any time delay $\tau\ge 1$; secondly a unified framework for decomposing both the deterministic and random time sequences into multiple modes is presented and explained; finally, the guidance of configuring the time delay is suggested, namely the time delay should be selected in a limited range via balancing the efficiency of matrix computation and accuracy of state estimation. It could be expected that the pulling back theorem will help the researchers and engineers to deepen the understanding of the theory and extend the applications of the SGMD and SSA in analyzing time sequences.

Title: Probabilistic Flexibility Aggregation of DERs for Ancillary Services Provision
Authors: Matthieu Jacobs, Mario Paolone
Abstract: This paper presents a grid-aware probabilistic approach to compute the aggregated flexibility at the grid connection point (GCP) of active distribution networks (ADNs) to allow the participation of DERs in ancillary services (AS) markets. Specifically an optimal power flow (OPF) method using a linear network model is used to compute the aggregated capability for the provision of multiple AS. We start from the method proposed in [1] and extend it to allow for optimizing the provision of multiple services simultaneously, ensure cost-effectiveness of the used DERs and handle uncertainties in a probabilistic way. The allocation of individual DERs power flexibilities accounts for the operational costs associated to the provision of different services and ensures cost-effectiveness while maximizing the value of the advertised aggregated flexibility, assuming known service prices. Empirical uncertainty sets are obtained to achieve a predefined coverage of the probability distribution in line with recent developments in the Nordic AS markets. Finally, a feeder-decomposition approach is proposed to ensure the methods applicability to realistic distribution networks with a large number of buses. Different case studies show the effectiveness of the method, highlight the importance of accounting for network constraints and illustrate its applicability to realistic distribution systems.

Title: Stochastic Model Predictive Control of Charging Energy Hubs with Conformal Prediction
Authors: Diego Fernández-Zapico, Theo Hofman, Mauro Salazar
Abstract: This paper presents an online energy management system for an energy hub where electric vehicles are charged combining on-site photovoltaic generation and battery energy storage with the power grid, with the objective to decide on the battery (dis)charging to minimize the costs of operation. To this end, we devise a scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (MPC) scheme that leverages probabilistic 24-hour-ahead forecasts of charging load, solar generation and day-ahead electricity prices to achieve a cost-optimal operation of the energy hub. The probabilistic forecasts leverage conformal prediction providing calibrated distribution-free confidence intervals starting from a machine learning model that generates no uncertainty quantification. We showcase our controller by running it over a 280-day evaluation in a closed-loop simulated environment to compare the observed cost of two scenario-based MPCs with two deterministic alternatives: a version with point forecast and a version with perfect forecast. Our results indicate that, compared to the perfect forecast implementation, our proposed scenario-based MPCs are 13% more expensive, and 1% better than their deterministic point-forecast counterpart

Title: DIFFRACT: Diffusion-based Restoration via Adaptive Control and Thresholding for Diffraction Imaging
Authors: Nikolay Falaleev, Nikolai Orlov
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for denoising Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) patterns using diffusion models. We propose a two-stage training process with a UNet-based architecture, incorporating an auxiliary regression head to predict the quality of the experimental pattern and assess the progress of the denoising process. The model uses an adaptive denoising strategy, which integrates quality prediction and feedback-driven iterative denoising process control. This adaptive feedback loop allows the model to adjust its schedule, providing fine control over the denoising process. Furthermore, our model can identify samples where no meaningful signal is present, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations.

Title: Tri-Hybrid Multi-User Precoding Using Pattern-Reconfigurable Antennas: Fundamental Models and Practical Algorithms
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Yuchen Zhang, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Md. Jahangir Hossain, Anas Chaaban
Abstract: The integration of pattern-reconfigurable antennas into hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures presents a promising path toward high-efficiency and low-cost transceiver solutions. Pattern-reconfigurable antennas can dynamically steer per-antenna radiation patterns, enabling more efficient power utilization and interference suppression. In this work, we study a tri-hybrid MIMO architecture for multi-user communication that integrates digital, analog, and antenna-domain precoding using pattern-reconfigurable antennas. For characterizing the reconfigurability of antenna radiation patterns, we develop two models -- Model~I and Model~II. Model~I captures realistic hardware constraints through limited pattern selection, while Model~II explores the performance upper bound by assuming arbitrary pattern generation. Based on these models, we develop two corresponding tri-hybrid precoding algorithms grounded in the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) framework, which alternately optimize the digital, analog, and antenna precoders under practical per-antenna power constraints. Realistic simulations conducted in ray-tracing generated environments are utilized to evaluate the proposed system and algorithms. The results demonstrate the significant potential of the considered tri-hybrid architecture in enhancing communication performance and hardware efficiency. However, they also reveal that the existing hardware is not yet capable of fully realizing these performance gains, underscoring the need for joint progress in antenna design and communication theory development.

Title: Spatio-spectral diarization of meetings by combining TDOA-based segmentation and speaker embedding-based clustering
Authors: Tobias Cord-Landwehr, Tobias Gburrek, Marc Deegen, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach
Abstract: We propose a spatio-spectral, combined model-based and data-driven diarization pipeline consisting of TDOA-based segmentation followed by embedding-based clustering. The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.

Title: Explicit Residual-Based Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines
Authors: Yui Tatsumi, Ziyue Zeng, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work.

Title: mmFlux: Crowd Flow Analytics with Commodity mmWave MIMO Radar
Authors: Anurag Pallaprolu, Winston Hurst, Yasamin Mostofi
Abstract: In this paper, we present mmFlux: a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering. This approach generates high-fidelity mmWave flow fields-compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs. In these graphs, edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence enables extraction of key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate mmFlux, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Title: The impact of heatwave-driven air conditioning adoption on electricity demand: A spatio-temporal case study for Germany
Authors: Leo Semmelmann, Frederik vom Scheidt
Abstract: Intensifying heatwaves driven by climate change are accelerating the adoption of mobile air conditioning (AC) systems. A rapid mass adoption of such AC systems could create additional stress on electricity grids and the power system. This study presents a novel method to estimate the electricity demand from AC systems both at the system level and at high temporal and spatial granularity. We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from the current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 12.9 GW, with urban hot-spots reaching 5.2 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges. Our findings underscore the urgency for proactive energy system planning to manage emerging demand peaks.

Title: Matrix Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Pio Ong, Yicheng Xu, Ryan M. Bena, Faryar Jabbari, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: This paper generalizes the control barrier function framework by replacing scalar-valued functions with matrix-valued ones. Specifically, we develop barrier conditions for safe sets defined by matrix inequalities -- both semidefinite and indefinite. Matrix inequalities can be used to describe a richer class of safe sets, including nonsmooth ones. The safety filters constructed from our proposed matrix control barrier functions via semidefinite programming (CBF-SDP) are shown to be continuous. Our matrix formulation naturally provides a continuous safety filter for Boolean-based control barrier functions, notably for disjunctions (OR), without relaxing the safe set. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with applications in drone network connectivity maintenance and nonsmooth obstacle avoidance, both in simulations and hardware experiments.

Title: Radio Frequency Identification: Decades at a Time
Authors: Christopher Saetia, Daniel M. Dobkin, Gregory Durgin
Abstract: In this article, we briefly review the history of the use of radio signals to identify objects, and of the key Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) standards for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and near-field communications that enabled broad use of these technologies in daily life. We will compare the vision for the future presented by the Auto-ID Lab in the early 21st century with the reality we see today, two decades and a little after. We will review some of the applications in which UHF RFID technology has become hugely successful, others where High Frequency Near-field Communications (HF NFC) is preferred, and applications where optical identification or active wireless communications are dominant. We will then examine some possible future paths for RFID technology. We anticipate that UHF read capability will become widely available for cellphones, making it as universal as NFC and Bluetooth are today. We will look at more sophisticated radio interfaces, such as multiple-antenna phased arrays for readers, and tunnel diode reflection for tags. We will discuss the integration of information from Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based image processing, barcodes, NFC and UHF tags, into a digital twin of the real environment experienced by the human user. We will examine the role of RFID with sensing in improving the management of perishable goods. The role that RFID might play in a truly circular economy, with intelligent recycling and reuse, will be discussed. Finally, we survey the many hazards and obstacles that obstruct the path to an RF-informed future.

Title: Invited Paper: Feature-to-Classifier Co-Design for Mixed-Signal Smart Flexible Wearables for Healthcare at the Extreme Edge
Authors: Maha Shatta, Konstantinos Balaskas, Paula Carolina Lozano Duarte, Georgios Panagopoulos, Mehdi B. Tahoori, Georgios Zervakis
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer a promising alternative to rigid silicon-based hardware for wearable healthcare devices, enabling lightweight, conformable, and low-cost systems. However, their limited integration density and large feature sizes impose strict area and power constraints, making ML-based healthcare systems-integrating analog frontend, feature extraction and classifier-particularly challenging. Existing FE solutions often neglect potential system-wide solutions and focus on the classifier, overlooking the substantial hardware cost of feature extraction and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs)-both major contributors to area and power consumption. In this work, we present a holistic mixed-signal feature-to-classifier co-design framework for flexible smart wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, we design the first analog feature extractors in FE, significantly reducing feature extraction cost. We further propose an hardware-aware NAS-inspired feature selection strategy within ML training, enabling efficient, application-specific designs. Our evaluation on healthcare benchmarks shows our approach delivers highly accurate, ultra-area-efficient flexible systems-ideal for disposable, low-power wearable monitoring.

Title: Arbitrary Precision Printed Ternary Neural Networks with Holistic Evolutionary Approximation
Authors: Vojtech Mrazek, Konstantinos Balaskas, Paula Carolina Lozano Duarte, Zdenek Vasicek, Mehdi B. Tahoori, Georgios Zervakis
Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability, conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits remains challenging. This work bridges the gap between classification accuracy and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average, being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5% accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.

Title: A Correction for the Paper "Symplectic geometry mode decomposition and its application to rotating machinery compound fault diagnosis"
Authors: Hong-Yan Zhang, Haoting Liu, Rui-Jia Lin, Yu Zhou
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for decomposing time series, which is based on the diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the authors of SGMD method generalized the form of the trajectory matrix in SSA, the DAP is not updated simultaneously. In this work, we pointed out the limitations of the SGMD method and fixed the bugs with the pulling back theorem for computing the given component of time series from the corresponding component of trajectory matrix.

Title: Guaranteed Nonconvex Factorization Approach for Tensor Train Recovery
Authors: Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

Title: A novel switched systems approach to nonconvex optimisation
Authors: Joel Ferguson, Saeed Ahmed, Juan E. Machado, Michele Cucuzzella, Jacquelien M. A. Scherpen
Abstract: We develop a novel switching dynamics that converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a nonlinear optimisation problem. This new approach is particularly notable for its lower dimensionality compared to conventional primal-dual dynamics, as it focuses exclusively on estimating the primal variable. Our method is successfully illustrated on general quadratic optimisation problems, the minimisation of the classical Rosenbrock function, and a nonconvex optimisation problem stemming from the control of energy-efficient buildings.

An H-Infinity based algebraic approximation is introduced for near-perfect tracking without preview. Additionally, we propose a novel robust control strategy combining the nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure. Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.

Title: Adaptive Central Frequencies Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech
Authors: Soufiyan Bahadi, Eric Plourde, Jean Rouat
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by nervous systems, revolutionizes information processing with its focus on efficiency and low power consumption. Using sparse coding, this paradigm enhances processing efficiency, which is crucial for edge devices with power constraints. The Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), adapted for audio with Gammatone and Gammachirp filter banks, provides an efficient sparse coding method for neuromorphic speech processing. Adaptive LCA (ALCA) further refines this method by dynamically adjusting modulation parameters, thereby improving reconstruction quality and sparsity. This paper introduces an enhanced ALCA version, the ALCA Central Frequency (ALCA-CF), which dynamically adapts both modulation parameters and central frequencies, optimizing the speech representation. Evaluations show that this approach improves reconstruction quality and sparsity while significantly reducing the power consumption of speech classification, without compromising classification accuracy, particularly on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip.

Title: Distributed Constrained Online Nonconvex Optimization with Compressed Communication
Authors: Kunpeng Zhang, Lei Xu, Xinlei Yi, Ming Cao, Karl H. Johansson, Tianyou Chai, Tao Yang
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents. For a time-varying graph, we propose a distributed online primal-dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources. We show that the proposed algorithm establishes an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{\max \{ {1 - {\theta_1},{\theta_1}} \}}}} )$ network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}/2}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of iterations and ${\theta_1} \in ( {0,1} )$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter. When Slater's condition holds (i.e, there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints at all iterations), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}}} )$. These bounds are comparable to the state-of-the-art results established by existing distributed online algorithms with perfect communication for distributed online convex optimization with (time-varying) inequality constraints. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.

Title: Optimizing Resource Allocation for QoS and Stability in Dynamic VLC-NOMA Networks via MARL
Authors: Aubida A. Al-Hameed, Safwan Hafeedh Younus, Mohamad A. Ahmed, Abdullah Baz
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) combined with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution for dense indoor wireless networks. Yet, managing resources effectively is challenged by VLC network dynamic conditions involving user mobility and light dimming. In addition to satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability requirements. Traditional resource allocation methods and simpler RL approaches struggle to jointly optimize QoS and stability under the dynamic conditions of mobile VLC-NOMA networks. This paper presents MARL frameworks tailored to perform complex joint optimization of resource allocation (NOMA power, user scheduling) and network stability (interference, handovers), considering heterogeneous QoS, user mobility, and dimming in VLC-NOMA systems. Our MARL frameworks capture dynamic channel conditions and diverse user QoS , enabling effective joint optimization. In these frameworks, VLC access points (APs) act as intelligent agents, learning to allocate power and schedule users to satisfy diverse requirements while maintaining network stability by managing interference and minimizing disruptive handovers. We conduct a comparative analysis of two key MARL paradigms: 1) Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) and 2) Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE). Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both tailored MARL frameworks and demonstrate an ability to handle complex optimization. The results show key trade-offs, as the CTDE approach achieved approximately 16\% higher for High priority (HP) user QoS satisfaction, while the CTCE approach yielded nearly 7 dB higher average SINR and 12\% lower ping-pong handover ratio, offering valuable insights into the performance differences between these paradigms in complex VLC-NOMA network scenarios.

Title: AI Simulation by Digital Twins: Systematic Survey, Reference Framework, and Mapping to a Standardized Architecture
Authors: Xiaoran Liu, Istvan David
Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.

Title: Ontology Neural Network and ORTSF: A Framework for Topological Reasoning and Delay-Robust Control
Authors: Jaehong Oh
Abstract: The advancement of autonomous robotic systems has led to impressive capabilities in perception, localization, mapping, and control. Yet, a fundamental gap remains: existing frameworks excel at geometric reasoning and dynamic stability but fall short in representing and preserving relational semantics, contextual reasoning, and cognitive transparency essential for collaboration in dynamic, human-centric environments. This paper introduces a unified architecture comprising the Ontology Neural Network (ONN) and the Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) to address this gap. The ONN formalizes relational semantic reasoning as a dynamic topological process. By embedding Forman-Ricci curvature, persistent homology, and semantic tensor structures within a unified loss formulation, ONN ensures that relational integrity and topological coherence are preserved as scenes evolve over time. The ORTSF transforms reasoning traces into actionable control commands while compensating for system delays. It integrates predictive and delay-aware operators that ensure phase margin preservation and continuity of control signals, even under significant latency conditions. Empirical studies demonstrate the ONN + ORTSF framework's ability to unify semantic cognition and robust control, providing a mathematically principled and practically viable solution for cognitive robotics.

Title: Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics and Out-of-Domain Evaluation
Authors: Hieu-Thi Luong, Inbal Rimon, Haim Permuter, Kong Aik Lee, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Partial audio deepfake localization poses unique challenges and remain underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate (EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%) but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.

Title: Adaptive Duration Model for Text Speech Alignment
Authors: Junjie Cao
Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line, while non-autoregressive end to end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction framework that can give promising phoneme-level duration distribution with given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise prediction and adaptation ability to conditions, compared to previous baseline models. Specifically, it makes a considerable improvement on phoneme-level alignment accuracy and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

Title: Numerical Uncertainty in Linear Registration: An Experimental Study
Authors: Niusha Mirhakimi, Yohan Chatelain, Tristan Glatard, Jean-Baptiste Poline
Abstract: While linear registration is a critical step in MRI preprocessing pipelines, its numerical uncertainty is understudied. Using Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) simulations, we assessed the most commonly used linear registration tools within major software packages (SPM, FSL, and ANTs) across multiple image similarity measures, two brain templates, and both healthy control (HC, n=50) and Parkinson's Disease (PD, n=50) cohorts. Our findings highlight the influence of linear registration tools and similarity measures on numerical stability. Among the evaluated tools and with default similarity measures, SPM exhibited the highest stability. FSL and ANTs showed greater and similar ranges of variability, with ANTs demonstrating particular sensitivity to numerical perturbations that occasionally led to registration failure. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between healthy and PD cohorts, suggesting that numerical stability analyses obtained with healthy subjects may generalise to clinical populations. Finally, we also demonstrated how numerical uncertainty measures may support automated quality control (QC) of linear registration results. Overall, our experimental results characterize the numerical stability of linear registration experimentally and can serve as a basis for future uncertainty analyses.

Title: QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots
Authors: Sheng Wu, Fei Teng, Hao Shi, Qi Jiang, Kai Luo, Kaiwei Wang, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: PUB: A Plasma-Propelled Ultra-Quiet Blimp with Two-DOF Vector Thrusting
Authors: Zihan Wang
Abstract: This study presents the design and control of a Plasma-propelled Ultra-silence Blimp (PUB), a novel aerial robot employing plasma vector propulsion for ultra-quiet flight without mechanical propellers. The system utilizes a helium-lift platform for extended endurance and a four-layer ring asymmetric capacitor to generate ionic wind thrust. The modular propulsion units allow flexible configuration to meet mission-specific requirements, while a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head enables thrust vector control. A closed-loop slip control scheme is implemented for stable maneuvering. Flight experiments demonstrate full-envelope capability, including take-off, climb, hover, descent, and smooth landing, confirming the feasibility of plasma vector propulsion, the effectiveness of DOF vector control, and the stability of the control system. Owing to its low acoustic signature, structural simplicity, and high maneuverability, PUB is well suited for noise-sensitive, enclosed, and near-space applications.

Title: Adaptive Optimisation of Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares in a Stochastic Framework
Authors: Michal Bujak, Rafal Kucharski
Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.
