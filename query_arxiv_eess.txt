Title: Sensor Fusion for Track Geometry Monitoring: Integrating On-Board Data and Degradation Models via Kalman Filtering
Authors: Huy Truong-Ba, Jacky Chin, Michael E. Cholette, Pietro Borghesani
Abstract: Track geometry monitoring is essential for maintaining the safety and efficiency of railway operations. While Track Recording Cars (TRCs) provide accurate measurements of track geometry indicators, their limited availability and high operational costs restrict frequent monitoring across large rail networks. Recent advancements in on-board sensor systems installed on in-service trains offer a cost-effective alternative by enabling high-frequency, albeit less accurate, data collection. This study proposes a method to enhance the reliability of track geometry predictions by integrating low-accuracy sensor signals with degradation models through a Kalman filter framework. An experimental campaign using a low-cost sensor system mounted on a TRC evaluates the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that incorporating frequent sensor data significantly reduces prediction uncertainty, even when the data is noisy. The study also investigates how the frequency of data recording influences the size of the credible prediction interval, providing guidance on the optimal deployment of on-board sensors for effective track monitoring and maintenance planning.

Title: Inverse Design in Distributed Circuits Using Single-Step Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jiayu Li, Masood Mortazavi, Ning Yan, Yihong Ma, Reza Zafarani
Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification. Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent ``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Title: Tram Positioning with Map-Enabled GNSS Data Reconciliation
Authors: Jakub Kašpar, Vít Fanta, Vladimír Havlena
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to tackle the problem of tram localization through utilizing a custom processing of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observables and the track map. The method is motivated by suboptimal performance in dense urban environments where the direct line of sight to GNSS satellites is often obscured which leads to multipath propagation of GNSS signals. The presented concept is based upon the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and has linear complexity (with respect to the number of GNSS measurements) as opposed to some other techniques mitigating the multipath signal propagation. The technique is demonstrated both on a simulated example and real data. The root-mean-squared errors from the simulated ground truth positions show that the presented solution is able to improve performance compared to a baseline localization approach. Similar result is achieved for the experiment with real data, while treating orthogonal projections onto the tram track as the true position, which is unavailable in the realistic scenario. This proof-of-concept shows results which may be further improved with implementation of a bank-of-models method or $\chi^2$-based rejection of outlying GNSS pseudorange measurements.

Title: Feasibility Study of CNNs and MLPs for Radiation Heat Transfer in 2-D Furnaces with Spectrally Participative Gases
Authors: Axel TahmasebiMoradi, Vincent Ren, Benjamin Le-Creurer, Chetra Mang
Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy. Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures. Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the model behavior.

Title: Exploring Noncommutative Polynomial Equation Methods for Discrete-Time Quaternionic Control
Authors: Michael Sebek
Abstract: We present new polynomial-based methods for discrete-time quaternionic systems, highlighting how noncommutative multiplication modifies classical control approaches. Defining quaternionic polynomials via a backward-shift operator, we examine left and right fraction representations of transfer functions, showing that right zeros correspond to similarity classes of quaternionic matrix right eigenvalues. We then propose a feedback design procedure that generalizes pole placement to quaternions - a first approach using a genuine quaternionic polynomial equation.

Title: Followstopper Revisited: Phase-space Lagrangian Controller for Traffic Decongestion
Authors: Rahul Bhadani
Abstract: This paper revisits Followerstopper, a phase-space-based control system that had demonstrated its ability to mitigate emergent traffic jams due to stop-and-go traffic during rush hour in the mixed-autonomy setting. Followerstopper was deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.

Title: Joint Routing and Control Optimization in VANET
Authors: Chen Huang, Dingxuan Wang, Ronghui Hou
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DynaRoute, an adaptive joint optimization framework for dynamic vehicular networks that simultaneously addresses platoon control and data transmission through trajectory-aware routing and safety-constrained vehicle coordination. DynaRoute guarantees continuous vehicle movement via platoon safety control with optimizing transmission paths through real-time trajectory prediction and ensuring reliable data. Our solution achieves three key objectives: (1) maintaining platoon stability through accurate data transmission, (2) enabling adaptive routing based on vehicle movement patterns, and (3) enhancing overall intelligent transportation system performance. DynaRoute equires predefined traffic models and adapts to dynamic network conditions using local vehicle state information. We present comprehensive simulation results demonstrating that DynaRoute maintains control and transmission performance in multiple complex scenarios while significantly improving throughput and reliability compared to traditional approaches.

Title: Continuous-Time Output Feedback Adaptive Control for Stabilization and Tracking with Experimental Results
Authors: Mohammad Mirtaba, Ankit Goel
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous-time output feedback adaptive control technique for stabilization and tracking control problems. The adaptive controller is motivated by the classical discrete-time retrospective cost adaptive control algorithm. The particle swarm optimization framework automates the adaptive algorithm's hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed controller is numerically validated in the tracking problems of a double integrator and a bicopter system and is experimentally validated in an attitude stabilization problem. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed controller is an effective technique for model-free output feedback control.

Title: A System for Accurate Tracking and Video Recordings of Rodent Eye Movements using Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
Authors: Isha Puri, David Cox
Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms, unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g., variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible, robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

Title: Standard LSParameter Estimators Ensure Finite Convergence Time for Linear Regression Equations Under an Interval Excitation Assumption
Authors: Romeo Ortega, Jose Guadalupe Romero, Stanislav Aranovskiy, Gang Tao
Abstract: In this brief note we recall the little-known fact that, for linear regression equations (LRE) with intervally excited (IE) regressors, standard Least Square (LS) parameter estimators ensure finite convergence time (FCT) of the estimated parameters. The convergence time being equal to the time length needed to comply with the IE assumption. As is well-known, IE is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of the LRE-hence, it is the weakest assumption for the on-or off-line solution of the parameter estimation problem.

Title: Low-Cost Wideband Tilted Beam Antenna for Millimeter-wave Vehicle Applications
Authors: Jiawang Li
Abstract: To facilitate vehicle coverage for millimeter-wave applications, this communication presents a low-cost, wideband tilted-beam antenna. A novel design is proposed in which a slot antenna is both directly excited and electromagnetically coupled to a monopole array. This slot-monopole configuration is inherently robust against substrate losses, enabling low-cost fabrication while maintaining high realized gain and compact size. Furthermore, the slot-fed structure effectively excites multiple resonant modes within the monopole array, resulting in a significantly enhanced bandwidth. Experimental results demonstrate that the antenna achieves a -10-dB impedance bandwidth of over 76.5% (20-44.78 GHz) and a peak realized gain of 6.1 dBi.

Title: Snap-and-tune: combining deep learning and test-time optimization for high-fidelity cardiovascular volumetric meshing
Authors: Daniel H. Pak, Shubh Thaker, Kyle Baylous, Xiaoran Zhang, Danny Bluestein, James S. Duncan
Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning (DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: DEKC: Data-Enable Control for Tethered Space Robot Deployment in the Presence of Uncertainty via Koopman Operator Theory
Authors: Ao Jin, Qinyi Wang, Sijie Wen, Ya Liu, Ganghui Shen, Panfeng Huang, Fan Zhang
Abstract: This work focuses the deployment of tethered space robot in the presence of unknown uncertainty. A data-enable framework called DEKC which contains offline training part and online execution part is proposed to deploy tethered space robot in the presence of uncertainty. The main idea of this work is modeling the unknown uncertainty as a dynamical system, which enables high accuracy and convergence of capturing uncertainty. The core part of proposed framework is a proxy model of uncertainty, which is derived from data-driven Koopman theory and is separated with controller design. In the offline stage, the lifting functions associated with Koopman operator are parameterized with deep neural networks. Then by solving an optimization problem, the lifting functions are learned from sampling data. In the online execution stage, the proxy model cooperates the learned lifting functions obtained in the offline phase to capture the unknown uncertainty. Then the output of proxy model is compensated to the baseline controller such that the effect of uncertainty can be attenuated or even eliminated. Furthermore, considering some scenarios in which the performance of proxy model may weaken, a receding-horizon scheme is proposed to update the proxy model online. Finally, the extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The implementation of proposed DEKC framework is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Learning event-triggered controllers for linear parameter-varying systems from data
Authors: Renjie Ma, Su Zhang, Wenjie Liu, Zhijian Hu, Peng Shi
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical behaviours in engineering applications can be approximated by linear-parameter varying (LPV) representations, but obtaining precise model knowledge to develop a control algorithm is difficult in practice. In this paper, we develop the data-driven control strategies for event-triggered LPV systems with stability verifications. First, we provide the theoretical analysis of ${\theta}$-persistence of excitation for LPV systems, which leads to the feasible data-based representations. Then, in terms of the available perturbed data, we derive the stability certificates for event-triggered LPV systems with the aid of Petersen's lemma in the sense of robust control, resulting in the computationally tractable semidefinite programmings, the feasible solutions of which yields the optimal gain schedulings. Besides, we generalize the data-driven eventtriggered LPV control methods to the scenario of reference trajectory tracking, and discuss the robust tracking stability accordingly. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our theoretical derivations by numerical simulations.

Title: Compact Amplified Laser Power Stabilization Using Robust Active Disturbance Rejection Control with Sensor Noise Decoupling
Authors: Yanpei Shi, Jingxuan Zhang, Zhuo Shi, Chenyao Zhang, Yuze Guo, Rui Feng
Abstract: Laser power instability, encompassing random jitter and slow drift, severely limits the performance of optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields, especially in large-scale OPM arrays for magnetoencephalography. Although a unified amplified laser (AL) architecture improves integration, fluctuations in the pump beam progressively degrade performance across all channels, exacerbated by environmental disturbances and system uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper presents a compact AL power stabilization approach based on an innovative dual-loop active disturbance rejection control (DLADRC) strategy, while integrating a comprehensive quantitative stability analysis through novel exponential decay estimates for extended state observers (ESOs) and control error dynamics. As validated through physical experimental results, the proposed method significantly improves AL's long-term stability with sensor noise decoupling, achieving an over 85.7% reduction in 1-hour power instability and a tenfold decrease in Allan variance for correlation times 10^2 s--10^3 s, compared to standard ADRC. Crucially, the strategy demonstrates robust effectiveness across diverse operating scenarios, enabling AL-based OPM systems to achieve their full potential in high-sensitivity biomagnetic field detection.

Title: Theoretical Foundations of Waste Factor and Waste Figure with Applications to Fixed Wireless Access and Relay Systems
Authors: Nurullah Sevim, Mostafa Ibrahim, Sabit Ekin, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: The exponential rise in energy consumption across wireless communication systems, particularly in anticipation of next-generation wireless systems, necessitates rigorous frameworks for evaluating and optimizing energy efficiency. This paper revisits and expands the concept of the Waste Factor (W), or Waste Figure (WF) in decibel scale, as a unifying metric that captures both utilized and wasted power in cascaded communication systems. Building upon its foundation in system-level power modeling, we integrate the Waste Factor into a refined formulation of the Consumption Factor (CF), the ratio of data rate to total consumed power, linking it directly to Shannon's theoretical limit on energy per bit. This analysis introduces additive energy waste into the classical energy-per-bit derivation through the Waste Factor term. We derive closed-form expressions for energy-per-bit expenditure in both direct and relay-assisted links and develop a decision rule to determine which communication path is more energy efficient under given conditions. While not modeled explicitly, Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can be interpreted as a special case of relay-based architectures within this unified formulation, suggesting broader applicability of the Waste Factor framework to emerging 6G use cases. The framework is then extended to a Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) scenario, where uplink and downlink asymmetries, traffic directionality, and component inefficiencies are jointly considered to analyze energy-optimal deployment strategies.

Title: Predictive reinforcement learning based adaptive PID controller
Authors: Chaoqun Ma, Zhiyong Zhang
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to address the challenges of controlling unstable and nonlinear systems by proposing an adaptive PID controller based on predictive reinforcement learning (PRL-PID), where the PRL-PID combines the advantages of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Design/methodology/approach: A predictive reinforcement learning framework is introduced, incorporating action smooth strategy to suppress overshoot and oscillations, and a hierarchical reward function to support training. Findings: Experimental results show that the PRL-PID controller achieves superior stability and tracking accuracy in nonlinear, unstable, and strongly coupled systems, consistently outperforming existing RL-tuned PID methods while maintaining excellent robustness and adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Originality/Value: By adopting predictive learning, the proposed PRL-PID integrates system model priors into data-driven control, enhancing both the control framework's training efficiency and the controller's stability. As a result, PRL-PID provides a balanced blend of model-based and data-driven approaches, delivering robust, high-performance control.

Title: Graph signal aware decomposition of dynamic networks via latent graphs
Authors: Bishwadeep Das, Andrei Buciulea, Antonio G. Marques, Elvin Isufi
Abstract: Dynamics on and of networks refer to changes in topology and node-associated signals, respectively and are pervasive in many socio-technological systems, including social, biological, and infrastructure networks. Due to practical constraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a fraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only hinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution. Such aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying latent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally uncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a powerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution through low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically lack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node signals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and overlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic graph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear combination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint evolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we estimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures via alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a stationary point. Numerical results show that the proposed method recovers individually and collectively expressive latent graphs, outperforming both standard tensor-based decompositions and signal-based topology identification methods in reconstructing the missing network especially when observations are limited.

Title: Plug-and-Play Linear Attention for Pre-trained Image and Video Restoration Models
Authors: Srinivasan Kidambi, Pravin Nair
Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nyström based linear approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures, including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution, demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Title: The Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership Filter for State Estimation on Groups
Authors: Tao Li, Yi Li, Lulin Zhang, Jiuxiang Dong
Abstract: The invariant filtering theory based on the group theory has been successful in statistical filtering methods. However, there exists a class of state estimation problems with unknown statistical properties of noise disturbances, and it is worth discussing whether the invariant observer still has performance advantages. In this paper, considering the problem of state estimation with unknown but bounded noise disturbances, an Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership Filter (InZSMF) method on groups is innovatively proposed, which extends the invariant filtering theory to the field of non-statistical filtering represented by set-membership filtering. Firstly, the InZSMF method transforms the state space from the traditional Euclidean vector space to the Lie group space to construct group affine discrete systems with unknown but bounded noise uncertainty defined by the zonotope on groups. Secondly, the nonlinear observer on the group is defined and the corresponding linearized estimation error is derived. Then, two observer gain tuning algorithms under the InZSMF method are proposed, respectively, the pole configuration method and the F-radius optimization method. Finally, through simulation experiments, it is shown that the InZSMF state estimation method is generally superior to the traditional Zonotopic Set-Membership Filter (ZSMF) state estimation method. Especially, when the initial estimations are imprecise, the convergence speed of state estimation, the accuracy of set-membership center estimation, and the average interval area of zonotopic estimation of the InZSMF method are significantly better than those of the ZSMF method.

Title: DCD: A Semantic Segmentation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Four-Chamber View
Authors: Donglian Li, Hui Guo, Minglang Chen, Huizhen Chen, Jialing Chen, Bocheng Liang, Pengchen Liang, Ying Tan
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber (A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise, anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module, enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal cardiac assessment.

Title: Toward Low-Altitude Airspace Management and UAV Operations: Requirements, Architecture and Enabling Technologies
Authors: Guiyang Luo, Jinglin Li, Qixun Zhang, Zhiyong Feng, Quan Yuan, Yijing Lin, Hui Zhang, Nan Cheng, Ping Zhang
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly advancing toward intelligence, connectivity, and coordination, bringing new challenges in dynamic airspace management, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation, and security management. Existing systems remain fragmented and lack effective coordination. To bridge these gaps, we propose UTICN (Ubiquitous and Trusted Intelligent Cellular-native Network) for LAE, a unified cellular-native architecture that integrates multi-domain sensing, high-precision positioning, intelligent aircraft-to-everything communication, dynamic airspace management, and UAV operational services. UTICN introduces key technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), passive and active positioning, intelligent machine communication, swarm coordination, and control-data decoupled management frameworks. We demonstrate UTICN's feasibility through two use cases, i.e., a city-level LAE management platform and a multi-frequency collaborative ISAC system. This work provides a fundamental reference for building a unified operational foundation and airspace management architecture for the LAE.

Title: Q-learning-based Hierarchical Cooperative Local Search for Steelmaking-continuous Casting Scheduling Problem
Authors: Yang Lv, Rong Hu, Bin Qian, Jian-Bo Yang
Abstract: The steelmaking continuous casting scheduling problem (SCCSP) is a critical and complex challenge in modern steel production, requiring the coordinated assignment and sequencing of steel charges across multiple production stages. Efficient scheduling not only enhances productivity but also significantly reduces energy consumption. However, both traditional heuristics (e.g., two-stage local search) and recent metaheuristics often struggle to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of practical SCCSP instances. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Q learning based hierarchical cooperative local search framework, termed HierC_Q, aimed at minimizing the weighted sum of the maximum completion time and the average waiting time in SCCSP. The core contributions of HierC_Q are twofold. First, considering the intrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is proposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration process towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical architecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve (L2I) tier and the "disturb to renovate" (D2R) tier. The L2I tier performs deep exploitation within promising regions using two independent Q-learning-based local search frameworks (QLSFs) tailored for subproblems, along with a synergy QLSF designed for the main problem. To enhance the effectiveness of local search, a validity evaluation approach and a speed-up evaluation method are also intro-duced, grounded in a detailed study of the problem's structure. Meanwhile, the D2R tier incorporates a perturbation and construction based solution renewal strategy to mitigate the risk of premature convergence. The superiority and effectiveness of HierC_Q are demonstrated through extensive comparisons with eleven local search frameworks and nine state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: Extended Spherical Geometry Algorithm for Spaceborne SAR Processing in Stripmap and TOPS Imaging Modes
Authors: Xinhua Mao, Manyi Tao, Jixia Fan
Abstract: The Spherical Geometry Algorithm (SGA) demonstrates superior capability in achieving efficient and precise spaceborne SAR image formation processing, even under challenging imaging conditions including non-linear radar trajectories and spherical Earth surface geometry. Nevertheless, the original SGA is specifically developed for spotlight SAR data processing and can't directly applied to processing spaceborne SAR data in other modes. In this paper, we first analyze the limitations of the SGA algorithm when applied to stripmap or TOPS mode SAR processing, and then propose an improved SGA algorithm which can process both stripmap and TOPS SAR data. Compared with the original algorithm, the new algorithm has two main differences. Firstly, in order to avoid undersampling during azimuth resampling in both modes, an instantaneous Doppler centroid removal process was added before azimuth interpolation processing by exploiting the endomorphism property of resampling operation. Secondly, the spectral analysis method used for the final step of azimuth compression in the original SGA has been replaced with a new matched filtering processing, which can avoid image aliasing in azimuth direction and improve computational efficiency. Measured real data processing results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Biologically Inspired Deep Learning Approaches for Fetal Ultrasound Image Classification
Authors: Rinat Prochii, Elizaveta Dakhova, Pavel Birulin, Maxim Sharaev
Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful, biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed" path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies 90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy > 0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging clinical settings.

Title: Approaching Dialogue State Tracking via Aligning Speech Encoders and LLMs
Authors: Šimon Sedláček, Bolaji Yusuf, Ján Švec, Pradyoth Hegde, Santosh Kesiraju, Oldřich Plchot, Jan Černocký
Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector module, with a focus on fully open-sourced and open-data components (WavLM-large, OLMo). We focus on ablating different aspects of such systems including full/LoRA adapter fine-tuning, the effect of agent turns in the dialogue history, as well as fuzzy matching-based output post-processing, which greatly improves performance of our systems on named entities in the dialogue slot values. We conduct our experiments on the SpokenWOZ dataset, and additionally utilize the Speech-Aware MultiWOZ dataset to augment our training data. Ultimately, our best-performing WavLM + connector + OLMo-1B aligned models achieve state of the art on the SpokenWOZ test set (34.66% JGA), and our system with Gemma-2-9B-instruct further surpasses this result, reaching 42.17% JGA on SpokenWOZ test.

Title: Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging based deep learning pooling for fault diagnosis in a wastewater treatment plant
Authors: Alicia Beneyto-Rodriguez, Gregorio I. Sainz-Palmero, Marta Galende-Hernández, María J. Fuente
Abstract: Nowadays, water reuse is a serious challenge to help address water shortages. Here, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) play a key role, and its proper operation is mandatory. So, fault diagnosis is a key activity for these plants. Their high complexity and large-scale require of smart methodologies for that fault diagnosis and safety operation. All these large-scale and complex industrial processes are monitored, allowing the data collection about the plant operation, so data driven approaches for fault diagnosis can be applied. A popular approach to fault diagnosis is deep learning-based methodologies. Here, a fault diagnosis methodology is proposed for a WWTP using a new linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) pooling based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and a sliding and overlapping time window. This window slides over input data based on the monitoring sampling time, then the diagnosis is carried out by the linguistic OWA pooling based DCNN. This alternative linguistic pooling uses well-known linguistic OWA quantifiers, which permit terms such as \textsl{Most, AtLeast, etc.}, supplying new intuitive options for the pooling tasks. This sliding time window and the OWA pooling based network permit a better and earlier fault diagnosis, at each sampling time, using a few monitoring samples and a fewer learning iterations than DCNN standard pooling. Several linguistic OWA operators have been checked with a benchmark for WWTPs. A set of 5 fault types has been used, taking into account 140 variables sampled at 15 minutes time intervals. The performance has been over $91\%$ for $Accuracy$, $Recall$ or $F1-Score$, and better than other competitive methodologies. Moreover, these linguistic OWA operators for DCNN pooling have shown a better performance than the standard \textsl{Max} and \textsl{Average} options.

Title: MAMBO: High-Resolution Generative Approach for Mammography Images
Authors: Milica Škipina, Nikola Jovišić, Nicola Dall'Asen, Vanja Švenda, Anil Osman Tur, Slobodan Ilić, Elisa Ricci, Dubravko Ćulibrk
Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of propagating an uncertain distribution by a possibly non-linear function and quantifying the resulting uncertainty. We measure the uncertainty using the Wasserstein distance, and for a given input set of distributions close in the Wasserstein distance, we compute a set of distributions centered at a discrete distribution that is guaranteed to contain the pushforward of any distribution in the input set. Our approach is based on approximating a nominal distribution from the input set to a discrete support distribution for which the exact computation of the pushforward distribution is tractable, thus guaranteeing computational efficiency to our approach. Then, we rely on results from semi-discrete optimal transport and distributional robust optimization to show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ the error introduced by our approach can be made smaller than $\epsilon$. Critically, in the context of dynamical systems, we show how our results allow one to efficiently approximate the distribution of a stochastic dynamical system with a discrete support distribution for a possibly infinite horizon while bounding the resulting approximation error. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our framework on various benchmarks, including a 10-D non-linear system, showing the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying uncertainty in linear and non-linear stochastic systems.

Title: Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion: A Study on the Impact of CBCT Quality and Alignment
Authors: Maximilian Tschuchnig, Lukas Lamminger, Philipp Steininger, Michael Gadermayr
Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

Title: Efficient Learning of Vehicle Controller Parameters via Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization: From Simulation to Experiment
Authors: Yongpeng Zhao, Maik Pfefferkorn, Maximilian Templer, Rolf Findeisen
Abstract: Parameter tuning for vehicle controllers remains a costly and time-intensive challenge in automotive development. Traditional approaches rely on extensive real-world testing, making the process inefficient. We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization approach that efficiently learns optimal controller parameters by leveraging both low-fidelity simulation data and a very limited number of real-world experiments. Our approach significantly reduces the need for manual tuning and expensive field testing while maintaining the standard two-stage development workflow used in industry. The core contribution is the integration of an auto-regressive multi-fidelity Gaussian process model into Bayesian optimization, enabling knowledge transfer between different fidelity levels without requiring additional low-fidelity evaluations during real-world testing. We validate our approach through both simulation studies and realworld experiments. The results demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality controller performance with only very few real-world experiments, highlighting its potential as a practical and scalable solution for intelligent vehicle control tuning in industrial applications.

Title: Minimal Order Recovery through Rank-adaptive Identification
Authors: Frédéric Zheng, Yassir Jedra, Alexandre Proutière
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying linear systems from noisy input-output trajectories. We introduce Thresholded Ho-Kalman, an algorithm that leverages a rank-adaptive procedure to estimate a Hankel-like matrix associated with the system. This approach optimally balances the trade-off between accurately inferring key singular values and minimizing approximation errors for the rest. We establish finite-sample Frobenius norm error bounds for the estimated Hankel matrix. Our algorithm further recovers both the system order and its Markov parameters, and we provide upper bounds for the sample complexity required to identify the system order and finite-time error bounds for estimating the Markov parameters. Interestingly, these bounds match those achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms that assume prior knowledge of the system order.

Title: Future Deployment and Flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources in the Distribution Grids of Switzerland
Authors: Lorenzo Zapparoli, Alfredo Oneto, María Parajeles Herrera, Blazhe Gjorgiev, Gabriela Hug, Giovanni Sansavini
Abstract: The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium- and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.

Title: Timing advance and Doppler shift estimation in LEO satellite networks: A recursive Bayesian study
Authors: Ashutosh Balakrishnan, Pierre Popineau, Philippe Martins
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite based non-terrestrial networks are a key theme of the upcoming 6G networks. These space networks are proposed to be used for high-mobility use-cases like airplanes and vehicles. The initial access process between a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE) involves timing advance (TA) value computation at the BS, requiring precise BS location information at the UE. It becomes more challenging in LEO satellite networks due to the fast moving LEO satellites and large pathloss, in addition to the mobile UE. This paper aims to compute the TA and Doppler shift experienced at the UE by modeling the joint system dynamics in a LEO satellite-mobile UE network through an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based recursive Bayesian framework. The framework accurately models the joint system dynamics by considering the LEO satellite acceleration. It constructs the Jacobian to linearize the inherent non-linearities present in the motion. Probabilistic insights regarding the state-update and propagation are also provided. The analytical framework factors in the limited satellite visibility at the UE and the satellite-UE geometry w.r.t. the earth center. The proposed framework is also useful when the satellite and UE clocks are not in sync, with the corresponding clock drift a function of the measured time difference of arrivals. Our results showcase the efficacy and robustness of the proposed EKF framework to estimate the TA and Doppler shift, even at very high UE speeds. The work is expected to be extremely useful in realizing LEO satellite based non-terrestrial networks.

Title: Confidence Boosts Trust-Based Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems
Authors: Luca Ballotta, Áron Vékássy, Stephanie Gil, Michal Yemini
Abstract: Wireless communication-based multi-robot systems open the door to cyberattacks that can disrupt safety and performance of collaborative robots. The physical channel supporting inter-robot communication offers an attractive opportunity to decouple the detection of malicious robots from task-relevant data exchange between legitimate robots. Yet, trustworthiness indications coming from physical channels are uncertain and must be handled with this in mind. In this paper, we propose a resilient protocol for multi-robot operation wherein a parameter {\lambda}t accounts for how confident a robot is about the legitimacy of nearby robots that the physical channel indicates. Analytical results prove that our protocol achieves resilient coordination with arbitrarily many malicious robots under mild assumptions. Tuning {\lambda}t allows a designer to trade between near-optimal inter-robot coordination and quick task execution; see Fig. 1. This is a fundamental performance tradeoff and must be carefully evaluated based on the task at hand. The effectiveness of our approach is numerically verified with experiments involving platoons of autonomous cars where some vehicles are maliciously spoofed.

Title: Distributed component-level modeling and control of energy dynamics in electric power systems
Authors: Hiya Gada, Rupamathi Jaddivada, Marija Ilic
Abstract: The widespread deployment of power electronic-based technologies is transforming modern power systems into fast, nonlinear, and heterogeneous systems. Conventional modeling and control approaches, rooted in quasi-static analysis and centralized control, are inadequate for these converter-dominated systems, which operate on fast timescales and involve proprietary models of diverse components. This paper adopts and extends a previously introduced energy space modeling framework grounded in energy conservation principles to address these challenges. We generalize the notion of a port interaction variable, which encodes energy exchange between interconnected, heterogeneous components in a unified and physically intuitive manner. A multilayered distributed control architecture is proposed, wherein the nonlinear physical dynamics of each component are lifted to a higher-level linear energy space through well-defined mappings. Distributed controllers are designed in this energy space using only local states and minimal neighbor information via port interaction variables. Two control designs, energy-based feedback linearizing control (FBLC) and sliding mode control (SMC), are proven to achieve asymptotic convergence to reference outputs. The approach is validated on two systems: an inverter-controlled RLC circuit and a synchronous generator connected to a load. In both cases, energy-based control improves transient response and reduces control effort.

Title: HabSim: Architecture for modelling disruptions, propagation, detection and repair in deep space habitats
Authors: Luca Vaccino, Alana K. Lund, Shirley J. Dyke, Mohsen Azimi, Ethan Vallerga
Abstract: Establishing long-term human settlements in deep space presents significant challenges. Harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature fluctuations, micrometeorite impacts, seismic activity, and exposure to solar and cosmic radiation pose obstacles to the design and operation of habitat systems. Prolonged mission duration and the vast distances from Earth introduce further complications in the form of delayed communication and limited resources, making autonomy especially desirable. Enabling simulation of the consequences of disruptions and their propagation through the various habitat subsystems is important for the development of autonomous and resilient space habitats. While existing simulation tools can assist in modeling some of these aspects, the integration of damage propagation, detection and repair in a computational model is rarely considered. This paper introduces and demonstrates a simulation architecture designed to model these aspects efficiently. By combining physics-based and phenomenological models, our approach balances computational efficiency with model fidelity. Furthermore, by coordinating subsystems operating at different time scales, we achieve real-time simulation capabilities. After describing the architecture, we demonstrate its application within HabSim, a space habitat system model developed by the NASA-funded Resilient Extraterrestrial Habitat Institute (RETHi). In these scenarios we consider fire hazard propagation within a lunar habitat to illustrate both how our architecture supports the modeling of disruption propagation, detection, and repair in a simulation environment and how the HabSim model can be leveraged for through stochastic simulations to support resilience assessment. The architecture developed herein is efficient and scalable, enabling researchers to gain insight into resilience, autonomy and decision-making.

Title: Hardware Limitations and Optimization Approach in 1-Bit RIS Design at 28 GHz
Authors: Hossein Rezaei, Mehmet Emin Arslan, George Yammine, Niels Neumann, Norman Franchi
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation, offering unprecedented control over wave reflections compared to traditional metallic reflectors. By utilizing an array of tunable elements, RIS can steer and shape electromagnetic waves to enhance signal quality in wireless communication and radar systems. However, practical implementations face significant challenges due to hardware limitations and phase quantization errors. In this work, a 1-bit RIS prototype operating at 28 GHz is developed to experimentally evaluate the impact of hardware constraints on RIS performance. Unlike conventional studies that model RIS as an ideal phase-shift matrix, this study accounts for physical parameters that influence the actual reflection pattern. In particular, the presence of specular reflection due to hardware limitations is investigated. Additionally, the effects of phase quantization errors, which stem from the discrete nature of RIS elements, are analyzed, and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization is introduced to mitigate these errors. The proposed optimization strategy effectively reduces gain degradation at the desired angle caused by 1-bit quantization, enhancing the overall performance of RIS. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through measurements, underscoring the importance of advanced phase control techniques in improving the functionality of RIS.

Title: Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Tasking over Rate-Limited Wireless Channels with Implicit Optimal Prior
Authors: Ahmad Halimi Razlighi, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: In this work, we expand the cooperative multi-task semantic communication framework (CMT-SemCom) introduced in [1], which divides the semantic encoder on the transmitter side into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs), to a more applicable design. Our proposed system model addresses real-world constraints by introducing a general design that operates over rate-limited wireless channels. Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint, represented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the density ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By applying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid learning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric machine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our framework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs variational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system's effectiveness in rate-constrained multi-task SemCom scenarios, highlighting its potential for enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Diver-Robot Communication Dataset for Underwater Hand Gesture Recognition
Authors: Igor Kvasić, Derek Orbaugh Antillon, Ðula Nađ, Christopher Walker, Iain Anderson, Nikola Mišković
Abstract: In this paper, we present a dataset of diving gesture images used for human-robot interaction underwater. By offering this open access dataset, the paper aims at investigating the potential of using visual detection of diving gestures from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a form of communication with a human diver. In addition to the image recording, the same dataset was recorded using a smart gesture recognition glove. The glove uses elastomer sensors and on-board processing to determine the selected gesture and transmit the command associated with the gesture to the AUV via acoustics. Although this method can be used under different visibility conditions and even without line of sight, it introduces a communication delay required for the acoustic transmission of the gesture command. To compare efficiency, the glove was equipped with visual markers proposed in a gesture-based language called CADDIAN and recorded with an underwater camera in parallel to the glove's onboard recognition process. The dataset contains over 30,000 underwater frames of nearly 900 individual gestures annotated in corresponding snippet folders. The dataset was recorded in a balanced ratio with five different divers in sea and five different divers in pool conditions, with gestures recorded at 1, 2 and 3 metres from the camera. The glove gesture recognition statistics are reported in terms of average diver reaction time, average time taken to perform a gesture, recognition success rate, transmission times and more. The dataset presented should provide a good baseline for comparing the performance of state of the art visual diving gesture recognition techniques under different visibility conditions.

Title: Quantitative Indices for Improving Metro Load Curve, Using Distributed Generation
Authors: Masoud Behbahani, Alireza Fereidunian
Abstract: This paper promises the idea of using DG (Distributed Generation) to improve the Metro load curve. Public transportation systems are often based on gasoline and diesel. However, with the gradual development in usage of the Metro and monorail, a new load with heavy demand, inappropriate load curve and middle LF (Load factor) is added to the electricity grid. In addition to supply problem of this massive consumer, the Metro load curve is another problem, which has a relatively low LF. Furthermore, Metro load peak hours coincide with the peaks of national grid. Improvement of the load curve is well-known in electrical engineering literature, which depending on the type of load curve, offers general recommendations in three approaches; DSM (Demand Side Management), DS (Distributed Storage) and DG. In this paper, to achieve quantitative indices of improvement for Metro load curve using DG, firstly based on the analysis of volume and consumption pattern of the main loads in Metro, the typical load curve has been extracted. Using this curve, the result of using DG is shown by quantitative parameters which represent the significant improvement in load curve. These parameters can be used to calculate economic indicators such as initial cost and ROI (Return of Investment).

Title: Online Learning Control Strategies for Industrial Processes with Application for Loosening and Conditioning
Authors: Yue Wu, Jianfu Cao, Ye Cao
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel adaptive Koopman Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, termed HPC-AK-MPC, designed to address the dual challenges of time-varying dynamics and safe operation in complex industrial processes. The framework integrates two core strategies: online learning and historically-informed safety constraints. To contend with process time-variance, a Recursive Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (rEDMDc) technique is employed to construct an adaptive Koopman model capable of updating its parameters from real-time data, endowing the controller with the ability to continuously learn and track dynamic changes. To tackle the critical issue of safe operation under model uncertainty, we introduce a novel Historical Process Constraint (HPC) mechanism. This mechanism mines successful operational experiences from a historical database and, by coupling them with the confidence level of the online model, generates a dynamic "safety corridor" for the MPC optimization problem. This approach transforms implicit expert knowledge into explicit, adaptive constraints, establishing a dynamic balance between pursuing optimal performance and ensuring robust safety. The proposed HPC-AK-MPC method is applied to a real-world tobacco loosening and conditioning process and systematically validated using an "advisor mode" simulation framework with industrial data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to historical operations, the proposed method significantly improves the Process Capability Index (Cpk) for key quality variables across all tested batches, proving its substantial potential in enhancing control performance while guaranteeing operational safety.

Title: TIP-Search: Time-Predictable Inference Scheduling for Market Prediction under Uncertain Load
Authors: Xibai Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

Title: Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA) for Enabled Flexible PONs
Authors: Yuhao Lian, Xiao Han, Xinmao Deng
Abstract: With the commercial deployment of 5G and the in-depth research of 6G, the demand for high-speed data services in the next-generation fiber optic access systems is growing increasingly. Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a research hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and low cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has difficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high spectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission technology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access (PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the low-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the high-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing the system capacity. PD-SDCMA supports higher-order modulation formats and more access groups, and is also compatible with the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture. The simulation results show that in a 25 km single-mode fiber system, compared with PD-NOMA and 3D-NOMA, PD-SDCMA can support more users and significantly reduce BER. This technology provides an efficient and low-cost solution for the evolution of Flexible PONs.

Title: Adaptive Per-Tree Canopy Volume Estimation Using Mobile LiDAR in Structured and Unstructured Orchards
Authors: Ali Abedi, Fernando Cladera, Mohsen Farajijalal, Reza Ehsani
Abstract: We present a real-time system for per-tree canopy volume estimation using mobile LiDAR data collected during routine robotic navigation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on static scans or assume uniform orchard structures, our method adapts to varying field geometries via an integrated pipeline of LiDAR-inertial odometry, adaptive segmentation, and geometric reconstruction. We evaluate the system across two commercial orchards, one pistachio orchard with regular spacing and one almond orchard with dense, overlapping crowns. A hybrid clustering strategy combining DBSCAN and spectral clustering enables robust per-tree segmentation, achieving 93% success in pistachio and 80% in almond, with strong agreement to drone derived canopy volume estimates. This work advances scalable, non-intrusive tree monitoring for structurally diverse orchard environments.

Title: Lite-RVFL: A Lightweight Random Vector Functional-Link Neural Network for Learning Under Concept Drift
Authors: Songqiao Hu, Zeyi Liu, Xiao He
Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL.

Title: Learning-Based Multiuser Scheduling in MIMO-OFDM Systems with Hybrid Beamforming
Authors: Pouya Agheli, Tugce Kobal, François Durand, Matthew Andrews
Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF) metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms, followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the specific criteria within a given scenario.

Title: Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning of Node-Wise Battery Dynamics in Smart Grids
Authors: Tarushri N. S.
Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable, and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems, modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles. Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

Title: Re4MPC: Reactive Nonlinear MPC for Multi-model Motion Planning via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Neşet Ünver Akmandor, Sarvesh Prajapati, Mark Zolotas, Taşkın Padır
Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom, such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Title: MD-ViSCo: A Unified Model for Multi-Directional Vital Sign Waveform Conversion
Authors: Franck Meyer, Kyunghoon Hur, Edward Choi
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Title: 5G Aero: A Prototyping Platform for Evaluating Aerial 5G Communications
Authors: Matteo Bordin, Madhukara S. Holla, Sakthivel Velumani, Salvatore D'Oro, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: The application of small-factor, 5G-enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has recently gained significant interest in various aerial and Industry 4.0 applications. However, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency 5G communication in aerial applications remains a critical and underexplored problem. This paper presents the 5th generation (5G) Aero, a compact UAV optimized for 5G connectivity, aimed at fulfilling stringent 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) requirements. We conduct a set of experiments in an indoor environment, evaluating the UAV's ability to establish high-throughput, low-latency communications in both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the 5G Aero meets the required 3GPP standards for Command and Control (C2) packets latency in both LoS and NLoS, and video latency in LoS communications and it maintains acceptable latency levels for video transmission in NLoS conditions. Additionally, we show that the 5G module installed on the UAV introduces a negligible 1% decrease in flight time, showing that 5G technologies can be integrated into commercial off-the-shelf UAVs with minimal impact on battery lifetime. This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the practical capabilities of current 5G networks to support advanced UAV operations in telecommunications, offering insights into potential enhancements and optimizations for UAV performance in 5G networks

Title: RadioDUN: A Physics-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Radio Map Estimation
Authors: Taiqin Chen, Zikun Zhou, Zheng Fang, Wenzhen Zou, Kanjun Liu, Ke Chen, Yongbing Zhang, Yaowei Wang
Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Title: Time-Aware World Model for Adaptive Prediction and Control
Authors: Anh N. Nhu, Sanghyun Son, Ming Lin
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high- and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and iterations.

Title: The interplay of robustness and generalization in quantum machine learning
Authors: Julian Berberich, Tobias Fellner, Christian Holm
Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning, their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an application to time series analysis.

Title: A Review on Score-based Generative Models for Audio Applications
Authors: Ge Zhu, Yutong Wen, Zhiyao Duan
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful deep generative techniques, producing high-quality and diverse samples in applications in various domains including audio. These models have many different design choices suitable for different applications, however, existing reviews lack in-depth discussions of these design choices. The audio diffusion model literature also lacks principled guidance for the implementation of these design choices and their comparisons for different applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion model design with an emphasis on design principles for quality improvement and conditioning for audio applications. We adopt the score modeling perspective as a unifying framework that accommodates various interpretations, including recent approaches like flow matching. We systematically examine the training and sampling procedures of diffusion models, and audio applications through different conditioning mechanisms. To address the lack of audio diffusion model codebases and to promote reproducible research and rapid prototyping, we introduce an open-source codebase at this https URL that implements our reviewed framework for various audio applications. We demonstrate its capabilities through three case studies: audio generation, speech enhancement, and text-to-speech synthesis, with benchmark evaluations on standard datasets.

Title: Hybrid Reasoning for Perception, Explanation, and Autonomous Action in Manufacturing
Authors: Christos Margadji, Sebastian W. Pattinson
Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings. Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications. Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted deployment in industrial settings.

Title: Passive acoustic non-line-of-sight localization without a relay surface
Authors: Tal I. Sommer, Ori Katz
Abstract: The detection and localization of a source hidden outside the Line-of-Sight (LOS) traditionally rely on the acquisition of indirect signals, such as those reflected from visible relay surfaces such as floors or walls. These reflected signals are then utilized to reconstruct the obscured scene. In this study, we present an approach that utilize signals diffracted from an edge of an obstacle to achieve three-dimensional (3D) localization of an acoustic point source situated outside the LOS. We address two scenarios - a doorway and a convex corner - and propose a localization method for each of them. For the first scenario, we utilize the two edges of the door as virtual detector arrays. For the second scenario, we exploit the spectral signature of a knife-edge diffraction, inspired by the human perception of sound location by the head-related transfer function (HRTF). In both methods, knife-edge diffraction is utilized to extend the capabilities of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) acoustic sensing, enabling localization in environments where conventional relay-surface based approaches may be limited.

Title: Designing lensless imaging systems to maximize information capture
Authors: Leyla A. Kabuli, Henry Pinkard, Eric Markley, Clara S. Hung, Laura Waller
Abstract: Mask-based lensless imaging uses an optical encoder (e.g. a phase or amplitude mask) to capture measurements, then a computational decoding algorithm to reconstruct images. In this work, we evaluate and design encoders based on the information content of their measurements using mutual information estimation. With this approach, we formalize the object-dependent nature of lensless imaging and study the interdependence between object sparsity, encoder multiplexing, and noise. Our analysis reveals that optimal encoder designs should tailor encoder multiplexing to object sparsity for maximum information capture, and that all optimally-encoded measurements share the same level of sparsity. Using mutual information-based optimization, we design information-optimal encoders with improved downstream reconstruction performance. We validate the benefits of reduced multiplexing for dense, natural images by evaluating experimental lensless imaging systems directly from captured measurements, without the need for image formation models, reconstruction algorithms, or ground truth images. Our comprehensive analysis establishes design and engineering principles for improving lensless imaging systems, and offers a model for the study of general multiplexing systems, especially those with object-dependent performance.

Title: Higher-Order Network Representation of J. S. Bach's Solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas: Topological and Geometrical Explorations
Authors: Dima Mrad, Sara Najem
Abstract: Music is inherently complex, with structures and interactions that unfold across multiple layers. Complex networks have emerged as powerful structures for the quantitative analysis of Western classical music, revealing significant features of its harmonic and structural organization. Although notable works have used these approaches to study music, dyadic representations of interactions fall short in conveying the underlying complexity and depth. In recent years, the limitations of traditional graph representations have been questioned and challenged in the context of interactions that could be higher-dimensional. Effective musical analysis requires models that capture higher-order interactions and a framework that simultaneously captures transitions between them. Subsequently, in this paper, we present a topological framework for analyzing J. S. Bach's Solo Violin Sonatas and Partitas that uses higher-order networks where single notes are vertices, two-note chords are edges, three-notes are triangles, etc. We subsequently account for the flow of music, by modeling transitions between successive notes. We identify genre-specific patterns in the works' geometric and topological properties. In particular, we find signatures in the trends of the evolution of the Euler characteristic and curvature, as well as examining adherence to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem across different movement types. The distinctions are revealed between slow movements, Fugues, and Baroque dance movements through their simplicial complex representation.

Title: Auto-Regressive vs Flow-Matching: a Comparative Study of Modeling Paradigms for Text-to-Music Generation
Authors: Or Tal, Felix Kreuk, Yossi Adi
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

Title: Stability estimates for adaptive focused time-frequency transforms
Authors: Pierre Warion (I2M), Bruno Torrésani (I2M)
Abstract: This contribution is a follow-up of a recent paper by the authors on adaptive, non-linear time-frequency transforms, focusing on the STFT based transforms. The adaptivity is provided by a focus function, that depends on the analyzed function or signal, and that adapts dynamically the time-frequency resolution of the analysis. Sticking to the continuous case setting, this work provides new stability results for the transform (stability with respect with the focus function). It also investigates in some details focus functions based upon regularized R{é}nyi entropies and show corresponding continuity results.

Title: Multi-Teacher Language-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Mehedi Hasan Bijoy, Dejan Porjazovski, Tamás Grósz, Mikko Kurimo
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French. It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Title: POLARON: Precision-aware On-device Learning and Adaptive Runtime-cONfigurable AI acceleration
Authors: Mukul Lokhande, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma
Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI models requires flexible hardware capable of supporting diverse precision formats, particularly for energy-constrained edge platforms. This work presents PARV-CE, a SIMD-enabled, multi-precision MAC engine that performs efficient multiply-accumulate operations using a unified data-path for 4/8/16-bit fixed-point, floating point, and posit formats. The architecture incorporates a layer adaptive precision strategy to align computational accuracy with workload sensitivity, optimizing both performance and energy usage. PARV-CE integrates quantization-aware execution with a reconfigurable SIMD pipeline, enabling high-throughput processing with minimal overhead through hardware-software co-design. The results demonstrate up to 2x improvement in PDP and 3x reduction in resource usage compared to SoTA designs, while retaining accuracy within 1.8% FP32 baseline. The architecture supports both on-device training and inference across a range of workloads, including DNNs, RNNs, RL, and Transformer models. The empirical analysis establish PARVCE incorporated POLARON as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for precision-adaptive AI acceleration at edge.

Title: A PDE-Based Image Dehazing Method via Atmospheric Scattering Theory
Authors: Zhuoran Zheng
Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[ -\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \] where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and $\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map $t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$ using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be generalized to the deep model paradigm.

Title: HiSin: Efficient High-Resolution Sinogram Inpainting via Resolution-Guided Progressive Inference
Authors: Jiaze E, Srutarshi Banerjee, Tekin Bicer, Guannan Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Bin Ren
Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Title: Addressing Pitfalls in Auditing Practices of Automatic Speech Recognition Technologies: A Case Study of People with Aphasia
Authors: Katelyn Xiaoying Mei, Anna Seo Gyeong Choi, Hilke Schellmann, Mona Sloane, Allison Koenecke
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has transformed daily tasks from video transcription to workplace hiring. ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and standardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and equitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and language disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR systems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in existing standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them impacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance for aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text standardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR performance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be consistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech communities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second, audits often display high-level demographic findings without further considering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic subgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the input audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the Word Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising from generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a more holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and exemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR performance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group. We call on practitioners to implement these robust ASR auditing practices that remain flexible to the rapidly changing ASR landscape.

Title: Adapting to Heterophilic Graph Data with Structure-Guided Neighbor Discovery
Authors: Victor M. Tenorio, Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Santiago Segarra, Antonio G. Marques
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting structural information to guide GNNs.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance. Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

Title: Over-the-Air Learning-based Geometry Point Cloud Transmission
Authors: Chenghong Bian, Yulin Shao, Deniz Gunduz
Abstract: This paper presents novel solutions for the efficient and reliable transmission of point clouds over wireless channels for real-time applications. We first propose SEmatic Point cloud Transmission (SEPT) for small-scale point clouds, which encodes the point cloud via an iterative downsampling and feature extraction process. At the receiver, SEPT decoder reconstructs the point cloud with latent reconstruction and offset-based upsampling. A novel channel-adaptive module is proposed to allow SEPT to operate effectively over a wide range of channel conditions. Next, we propose OTA-NeRF, a scheme inspired by neural radiance fields. OTA-NeRF performs voxelization to the point cloud input and learns to encode the voxelized point cloud into a neural network. Instead of transmitting the extracted feature vectors as in SEPT, it transmits the learned neural network weights in an analog fashion along with few hyperparameters that are transmitted digitally. At the receiver, the OTA-NeRF decoder reconstructs the original point cloud using the received noisy neural network weights. To further increase the bandwidth efficiency of the OTA-NeRF scheme, a fine-tuning algorithm is developed, where only a fraction of the neural network weights are retrained and transmitted. Noticing the poor generality of the OTA-NeRF schemes, we propose an alternative approach, termed OTA-MetaNeRF, which encodes different input point clouds into the latent vectors with shared neural network weights. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed SEPT, OTA-NeRF and OTA-MetaNeRF schemes achieve superior or comparable performance over the conventional approaches, where an octree-based or a learning-based point cloud compression scheme is concatenated with a channel code. Finally, the run-time complexities are evaluated to verify the capability of the proposed schemes for real-time communications.

Title: Identifiable specializations for ODE models
Authors: Alexey Ovchinnikov, Anand Pillay, Gleb Pogudin, Thomas Scanlon
Abstract: The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place. Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial specialization of the parameters. As an extra feature of our approach, the resulting (at least) locally identifiable reparameterization has the same shape: the monomials in the new state variables in the new model are formed in the same way as in the original model. Furthermore, we give a sufficient observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.

Title: Algorithm to find new identifiable reparametrizations of parametric rational ODE models
Authors: Nicolette Meshkat, Alexey Ovchinnikov, Thomas Scanlon
Abstract: Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can try to add more input-output data or decrease the number of unknown parameters, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, with and without inputs, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.

Title: Meta-DSP: A Meta-Learning Approach for Data-Driven Nonlinear Compensation in High-Speed Optical Fiber Systems
Authors: Xinyu Xiao (1), Zhennan Zhou (2), Bin Dong (2,3,4), Dingjiong Ma (5), Li Zhou (5), Jie Sun (5) ((1) School of Mathematical Science, Peking University, (2) Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University, (3) Center for Machine Learning Research, Peking University, (4) National Biomedical Imaging Center, Peking University, (5) Theory Lab, Central Research Institute, 2012 Labs, Huawei Technology Co. Ltd.)
Abstract: Nonlinear effects in high-speed optical fiber systems fundamentally limit channel capacity. While traditional Digital Backward Propagation (DBP) with adaptive filters addresses these effects, its computational complexity remains impractical. Data-driven solutions like Filtered DBP (FDBP) reduce complexity but critically lack inherent generalization: Their nonlinear compensation capability cannot be naturally extended to new transmission rates or WDM channel counts without retraining on newly collected data. We propose Meta-DSP, a novel signal processing pipeline combining: (1) Meta-DBP, a meta-learning-based DBP model that generalizes across transmission parameters without retraining, and (2) XPM-ADF, a carefully engineered adaptive filter designed to address multi-channel nonlinear distortions. The system demonstrates strong generalization, learning from 40 Gbaud single-channel data and successfully applying this knowledge to higher rates (80/160 Gbaud) and multi-channel configurations (up to 21 channels). Experimental results show Meta-DSP improves Q-factor by 0.55 dB over CDC in challenging scenarios while reducing computational complexity 10$\times$ versus DBP. This work provides a scalable solution for nonlinear compensation in dynamic optical networks, balancing performance with practical computational constraints.

Title: Antifragile Perimeter Control: Anticipating and Gaining from Disruptions with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Linghang Sun, Michail A. Makridis, Alexander Genser, Cristian Axenie, Margherita Grossi, Anastasios Kouvelas
Abstract: The optimal operation of transportation systems is often susceptible to unexpected disruptions, such as traffic accidents and social events. Many established control strategies relying on mathematical models can struggle with real-world disruptions, leading to a significant deviation from their anticipated efficiency. This work applies the cutting-edge concept of antifragility to design a traffic control strategy for urban road networks against disruptions. Antifragility sets itself apart from robustness, resilience, and reliability as it represents a system's ability to not only withstand stressors, shocks, and volatility but also to thrive and enhance performance in the presence of such adversarial events. Incorporating antifragile terms composed of traffic state derivatives and redundancy, a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed and subsequently evaluated in a two-region cordon-shaped urban traffic perimeter network. Promising results highlight (a) the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods under incremental magnitude of disruptions, (b) distribution skewness as the antifragility indicator demonstrating its relative antifragility, and (c) its effectiveness under limited observability due to real-world data availability constraints. The proposed antifragile methodology is generalizable and holds potential for application beyond perimeter control, offering integration into systems exposed to disruptions across various disciplines.

Title: A Hybrid Algorithm for Iterative Adaptation of Feedforward Controllers: an Application on Electromechanical Switches
Authors: Eloy Serrano-Seco (1), Eduardo Moya-Lasheras (1), Edgar Ramirez-Laboreo (1) ((1) Universidad de Zaragoza)
Abstract: Electromechanical switching devices such as relays, solenoid valves, and contactors offer several technical and economic advantages that make them widely used in industry. However, uncontrolled operations result in undesirable impact-related phenomena at the end of the stroke. As a solution, different soft-landing controls have been proposed. Among them, feedforward control with iterative techniques that adapt its parameters is a solution when real-time feedback is not available. However, these techniques typically require a large number of operations to converge or are computationally intensive, which limits a real implementation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the iterative adaptation that is able to eventually adapt the search coordinate system and to reduce the search dimensional size in order to accelerate convergence. Moreover, it automatically toggles between a derivative-free and a gradient-based method to balance exploration and exploitation. To demonstrate the high potential of the proposal, each novel part of the algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art approach via simulation.

Title: Circuit-theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation -- Balancing Optimality and AC Feasibility
Authors: Peng Sang, Amritanshu Pandey
Abstract: AC State Estimation (ACSE) is widely recognized as a practical approach for determining the grid states in steady-state conditions. It serves as a fundamental analysis to ensure grid security and is a reference for market dispatch. As grid complexity increases with rapid electrification and decarbonization, there is a growing need for more accurate knowledge of the grid operating state. However, existing ACSE algorithms have technical gaps. Critically, current ACSE algorithms are susceptible to erroneous system parameters, which are assumed to be fixed in traditional approaches. In this paper, we build a novel circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm to address this limitation. The innovative algorithm builds an analogous equivalent circuit of the grid with states and certain parameters unknown. It solves a circuit-constrained optimization to estimate the most likely grid states and parameters given a set of measurements. Further, it quantifies the goodness of the estimated output by formulating tight convex envelopes around the original non-convex problem to quantify the quality of estimates. We compare the various proposed approaches on systems with up to 2869 nodes while demonstrating a tradeoff between solution optimality and model fidelity.

Title: Atmospheric Density-Compensating Model Predictive Control for Targeted Reentry of Drag-Modulated Spacecraft
Authors: Alex D. Hayes, Ryan J. Caverly
Abstract: This paper presents an estimation and control framework that enables the targeted reentry of a drag-modulated spacecraft in the presence of atmospheric density uncertainty. In particular, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the in-flight density errors relative to the atmospheric density used to generate the nominal guidance trajectory. This information is leveraged within a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to improve tracking performance, reduce control effort, and increase robustness to actuator saturation compared to the state-of-the-art approach. The estimation and control framework is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation campaign with historical space weather data. These simulation efforts demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to stay within 100 km of the guidance trajectory at all points in time for 98.4% of cases. The remaining 1.6% of cases were pushed away from the guidance by large density errors, many due to significant solar storms and flares, that could not physically be compensated for by the drag control device. For the successful cases, the proposed framework was able to guide the spacecraft to the desired location at the entry interface altitude with a mean error of 12.1 km and 99.7% of cases below 100 km.

Title: Variable Rate Learned Wavelet Video Coding using Temporal Layer Adaptivity
Authors: Anna Meyer, André Kaup
Abstract: Learned wavelet video coders provide an explainable framework by performing discrete wavelet transforms in temporal, horizontal, and vertical dimensions. With a temporal transform based on motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF), spatial and temporal scalability is obtained. In this paper, we introduce variable rate support and a mechanism for quality adaption to different temporal layers for a higher coding efficiency. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that allows training with multiple temporal layers. Our experiments demonstrate Bjøntegaard Delta bitrate savings of at least -32% compared to a learned MCTF model without these extensions. Training and inference code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Enhanced channel estimation for near-field IRS-aided multi-user MIMO system via a large deep residual network
Authors: Yan Wang, Yongqiang Li, Minghao Chen, Yu Yao, Feng Shu, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this paper, the channel estimation (CE) of intelligent reflecting surface-aided near-field (NF) multi-user communication is investigated. Initially, the least square (LS) estimator and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator for the estimated channel are designed, their mean square errors (MSEs) are derived, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation. Subsequently, in view of the fact that the NF channel model is more sensitive to distance variations compared to the far-field model, this leads to pronounced discrepancies in the user channel characteristics in different regions. To effectively capture and utilize these diverse channel features, users are initially divided into distinct regions predicated on pivotal parameters, such as channel angle and distance. Correspondingly, a user region classifier based on convolutional neural networks is designed. Then, to fully harness the potential of deep residual networks (DRNs) in denoising, the aforementioned CE problem is reconceptualized as a denoising task, and a DRN-driven single region NF CE network, named SR-DRN-NFCE, is proposed. In addition, by integrating SR-DRN-NFCE networks corresponding to different regions and conducting joint training in a federated learning (FL) manner, a new network is obtained, named FL-DRN-NFCE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE network outperforms LS, MMSE, and no residual connections in terms of MSE, and the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE method has higher CE accuracy than the SR-DRN-NFCE method.

Title: Phonology-Guided Speech-to-Speech Translation for African Languages
Authors: Peter Ochieng, Dennis Kaburu
Abstract: We present a prosody-guided framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that aligns and translates speech \emph{without} transcripts by leveraging cross-linguistic pause synchrony. Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.

Title: Cooperative and Collaborative Multi-Task Semantic Communication for Distributed Sources
Authors: Ahmad Halimi Razlighi, Maximilian H. V. Tillmann, Edgar Beck, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a multi-task semantic communication (SemCom) system for distributed sources, extending the existing focus on collaborative single-task execution. We build on the cooperative multi-task processing introduced in [1], which divides the encoder into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs). While earlier studies in multi-task SemCom focused on full observation settings, our research explores a more realistic case where only distributed partial observations are available, such as in a production line monitored by multiple sensing nodes. To address this, we propose an SemCom system that supports multi-task processing through cooperation on the transmitter side via split structure and collaboration on the receiver side. We have used an information-theoretic perspective with variational approximations for our end-to-end data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative and collaborative multi-task (CCMT) SemCom system significantly improves task execution accuracy, particularly in complex datasets, if the noise introduced from the communication channel is not limiting the task performance too much. Our findings contribute to a more general SemCom framework capable of handling distributed sources and multiple tasks simultaneously, advancing the applicability of SemCom systems in real-world scenarios.

Title: Little to lose: the case for a robust European green hydrogen strategy
Authors: Koen van Greevenbroek, Johannes Schmidt, Marianne Zeyringer, Alexander Horsch
Abstract: The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not committed to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.

Title: A Support Vector Approach in Segmented Regression for Map-assisted Non-cooperative Source Localization
Authors: Hao Sun, Weiming Huang, Xianghao Yu, Junting Chen
Abstract: This paper presents a non-cooperative source localization approach based on received signal strength (RSS) and 2D environment map, considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. Conventional localization methods, e.g., weighted centroid localization (WCL), may perform bad. This paper proposes a segmented regression approach using 2D maps to estimate source location and propagation environment jointly. By leveraging topological information from the 2D maps, a support vector-assisted algorithm is developed to solve the segmented regression problem, separate the LOS and NLOS measurements, and estimate the location of source. The proposed method demonstrates a good localization performance with an improvement of over 30% in localization rooted mean squared error (RMSE) compared to the baseline methods.

Title: LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Boyi Kang, Xinfa Zhu, Zihan Zhang, Zhen Ye, Mingshuai Liu, Ziqian Wang, Yike Zhu, Guobin Ma, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Wei Xue, Lei Xie
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.

Title: Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review
Authors: Arash J. Khabbazi, Elias N. Pergantis, Levi D. Reyes Premer, Panagiotis Papageorgiou, Alex H. Lee, James E. Braun, Gregor P. Henze, Kevin J. Kircher
Abstract: A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. Here we review 24 papers that document field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.

Title: Leveraging Line-of-Sight Propagation for Near-Field Beamfocusing in Cell-Free Networks
Authors: Georgios Mylonopoulos, Giovanni Interdonato, Stefano Buzzi, Pei Liu
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising approach for next-generation wireless networks, enabling scalable deployments of multiple small access points (APs) to enhance coverage and service for multiple user equipments (UEs). While most existing research focuses on low-frequency bands with Rayleigh fading models, emerging 5G trends are shifting toward higher frequencies, where geometric channel models and line-of-sight (LoS) propagation become more relevant. In this work, we explore how distributed massive MIMO in the LoS regime can achieve near-field-like conditions by forming artificially large arrays through coordinated AP deployments. We investigate centralized and decentralized CF architectures, leveraging structured channel estimation (SCE) techniques that exploit the line-of-sight properties of geometric channels. Our results demonstrate that dense distributed AP deployments significantly improve system performance w.r.t. the case of a co-located array, even in highly populated UE scenarios, while SCE approaches the performance of perfect CSI.

Title: The trajectoRIR Database: Room Acoustic Recordings Along a Trajectory of Moving Microphones
Authors: Stefano Damiano, Kathleen MacWilliam, Valerio Lorenzoni, Thomas Dietzen, Toon van Waterschoot
Abstract: Data availability is essential to develop acoustic signal processing algorithms, especially when it comes to data-driven approaches that demand large and diverse training datasets. For this reason, an increasing number of databases have been published in recent years, including either room impulse responses (RIRs) or recordings of moving audio. In this paper we introduce the trajectoRIR database, an extensive, multi-array collection of both dynamic and stationary acoustic recordings along a controlled trajectory in a room. Specifically, the database features recordings using moving microphones and stationary RIRs spatially sampling the room acoustics along an L-shaped, 3.74-meter-long trajectory. This combination makes trajectoRIR unique and applicable in various tasks ranging from sound source localization and tracking to spatially dynamic sound field reconstruction and system identification. The recording room has a reverberation time of 0.5 seconds, and the three different microphone configurations employed include a dummy head, with additional reference microphones located next to the ears, 3 first-order Ambisonics microphones, two circular arrays of 16 and 4 channels, and a 12-channel linear array. The motion of the microphones was achieved using a robotic cart traversing a rail at three speeds: [0.2,0.4,0.8] m/s. Audio signals were reproduced using two stationary loudspeakers. The collected database features 8648 stationary RIRs, as well as perfect sweeps, speech, music, and stationary noise recorded during motion. MATLAB and Python scripts are included to access the recorded audio as well as to retrieve geometrical information.

Title: Fusing Global and Local: Transformer-CNN Synergy for Next-Gen Current Estimation
Authors: Junlang Huang, Hao Chen, Li Luo, Yong Cai, Lexin Zhang, Tianhao Ma, Yitian Zhang, Zhong Guan
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model combining Transformer and CNN for predicting the current waveform in signal lines. Unlike traditional approaches such as current source models, driver linear representations, waveform functional fitting, or equivalent load capacitance methods, our model does not rely on fixed simplified models of standard-cell drivers or RC loads. Instead, it replaces the complex Newton iteration process used in traditional SPICE simulations, leveraging the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer framework to directly predict current responses without iterative solving steps. The hybrid architecture effectively integrates the global feature-capturing ability of Transformers with the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs, significantly improving the accuracy of current waveform predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional SPICE simulations, the proposed algorithm achieves an error of only 0.0098. These results highlight the algorithm's superior capabilities in predicting signal line current waveforms, timing analysis, and power evaluation, making it suitable for a wide range of technology nodes, from 40nm to 3nm.

Title: Accurate semiclassical analysis of light propagation on tilted hyperplanes
Authors: Patrick Gioia, San Vu Ngoc (IUF, IRMAR)
Abstract: In the scalar light model given by Helmholtz' equation in R^{1+d} , we consider the transformation of an initial scene (a hologram) in {0}xR^d by an arbitrary affine transformation (which can be viewed as a propagation into a tilted hyperplane). In the high frequency regime, we use microlocal and semiclassical analysis to describe the propagator as a semiclassical Fourier integral operator, thus generalising the well-known Angular Spectrum formula from optics. We then prove new precise Egorov theorems, including subprincipal terms, which indicate how to take into account the propagation along rays of geometric optics.

Title: UAV-Mounted IRS (UMI) in the Presence of Hovering Fluctuations: 3D Pattern Characterization and Performance Analysis
Authors: Mohammad Javad Zakavi, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Farid Ashtiani, Masoumeh Nasiri-Kenari
Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to leverage the benefits of this technology for future communication networks, such as 6G. Key advantages include enhanced spectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible deployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI) technology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this challenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active elements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles, considering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The relationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking into account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form distribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear approximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit theorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance of UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should utilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As a result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS systems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in UAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the optimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.

Title: Model-based learning for joint channel estimationand hybrid MIMO precoding
Authors: Nay Klaimi (IETR, INSA Rennes), Amira Bedoui (IETR, INSA Rennes), Clément Elvira (IETR), Philippe Mary (INSA Rennes, IETR), Luc Le Magoarou (INSA Rennes, IETR)
Abstract: Hybrid precoding is a key ingredient of cost-effective massive multiple-input multiple-output transceivers. However, setting jointly digital and analog precoders to optimally serve multiple users is a difficult optimization problem. Moreover, it relies heavily on precise knowledge of the channels, which is difficult to obtain, especially when considering realistic systems comprising hardware impairments. In this paper, a joint channel estimation and hybrid precoding method is proposed, which consists in an end-to-end architecture taking received pilots as inputs and outputting pre-coders. The resulting neural network is fully model-based, making it lightweight and interpretable with very few learnable parameters. The channel estimation step is performed using the unfolded matching pursuit algorithm, accounting for imperfect knowledge of the antenna system, while the precoding step is done via unfolded projected gradient ascent. The great potential of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated on realistic synthetic channels.

Title: Dual Attention Residual U-Net for Accurate Brain Ultrasound Segmentation in IVH Detection
Authors: Dan Yuan, Yi Feng, Ziyun Tang
Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection. Code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Estimation of Head Motion in Structural MRI and its Impact on Cortical Thickness Measurements in Retrospective Data
Authors: Charles Bricout, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Sylvain Bouix
Abstract: Motion-related artifacts are inevitable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and can bias automated neuroanatomical metrics such as cortical thickness. These biases can interfere with statistical analysis which is a major concern as motion has been shown to be more prominent in certain populations such as children or individuals with ADHD. Manual review cannot objectively quantify motion in anatomical scans, and existing quantitative automated approaches often require specialized hardware or custom acquisition protocols. Here, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to estimate a summary motion metric in retrospective routine research scans by leveraging a large training dataset of synthetically motion-corrupted volumes. We validate our method with one held-out site from our training cohort and with 14 fully independent datasets, including one with manual ratings, achieving a representative $R^2 = 0.65$ versus manual labels and significant thickness-motion correlations in 12/15 datasets. Furthermore, our predicted motion correlates with subject age in line with prior studies. Our approach generalizes across scanner brands and protocols, enabling objective, scalable motion assessment in structural MRI studies without prospective motion correction. By providing reliable motion estimates, our method offers researchers a tool to assess and account for potential biases in cortical thickness analyses.

Title: On Loss-Minimal Radial Topologies in MV Systems
Authors: Anton Hinneck, Mathias Duckheim, Michael Metzger, Stefan Niessen
Abstract: Distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) means optimizing the topology of a distribution grid using switching actions. Switching actions are a degrees of freedom available to distribution system operators, e.g. to manage planned and unplanned outages. DSR is a NP-hard combinatorial problem. Finding good or even optimal solutions is computationally expensive. While transmission and high-voltage grids are generally operated in a meshed state, MV distribution systems are commonly operated as radial networks even though meshed operation would be supported. This improves resilience because faults can be isolated more easily keeping the rest of the system operational and minimizing impact on customers. We propose an AC DSR formulation and benchmark it against a common formulation from the literature. Our results indicate that additional acyclicity constraints can significantly improve solver performance.

Title: Fourier-Domain CFO Estimation Using Jutted Binary Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros
Authors: Parker Huggins, Anthony Joseph Perre, Alphan Sahin
Abstract: In this work, we propose jutted binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (J-BMOCZ) for non-coherent communication under a carrier frequency offset (CFO). By introducing asymmetry to the Huffman BMOCZ zero constellation, we exploit the identical aperiodic auto-correlation function of BMOCZ sequences to derive a Fourier-domain metric for CFO estimation. Unlike the existing methods for Huffman BMOCZ, which require a cyclically permutable code (CPC) for pilot-free CFO correction, J-BMOCZ enables the estimation of a CFO without the use of pilots or channel coding. Through numerical simulations in additive white Gaussian noise and fading channels, we show that the bit error rate (BER) loss of J-BMOCZ under a CFO is just 1 dB over Huffman BMOCZ without a CFO. Furthermore, the results show that coded J-BMOCZ achieves better BER performance than Huffman BMOCZ with a CPC.

Title: Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of AoA Estimation in Single-Anchor 5G Uplink Positioning
Authors: Thodoris Spanos, Fran Fabra, José A. López-Salcedo, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Nikos Kanistras, Ivan Lapin, Vassilis Paliouras
Abstract: As we move towards 6G, the demand for high-precision, cost-effective positioning solutions becomes increasingly critical. Single-anchor positioning offers a promising alternative to traditional multi-anchor approaches, particularly in complex propagation environments where infrastructure costs and deployment constraints present significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of key algorithmic choices in the development of a single-anchor 5G uplink positioning testbed. Our developed testbed uses angle of arrival (AoA) estimation combined with range measurements from an ultra-wideband pair, to derive the position. The simulations conducted assess the impact of the selected algorithms on channel order and AoA estimation, while the influence of antenna calibration errors on AoA estimation is also examined. Finally, we compare simulations and results obtained from our developed platform.

Title: Generalization analysis of an unfolding network for analysis-based Compressed Sensing
Authors: Vicky Kouni, Yannis Panagakis
Abstract: Unfolding networks have shown promising results in the Compressed Sensing (CS) field. Yet, the investigation of their generalization ability is still in its infancy. In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework complies with our theoretical findings and outperforms the baseline, consistently for all datasets.

Title: Contest for system observability as an infinitely repeated game
Authors: Yueyue Xu, Panpan Zhou, Lin Wang, Zhixin Liu, Xiaoming Hu
Abstract: This paper studies a system security problem in the context of observability based on a two-person noncooperative infinitely repeated game. Both the attacker and the defender have means to modify the dimension of the unobservable subspace, which is set as the value function. Utilizing tools from geometric control, we construct the best response sets considering one-step and two-step optimality respectively to maximize or minimize the value function. We establish a unified necessary-and-sufficient condition for Nash equilibrium that holds for both one-step and two-step optimizations. Our analysis further uncovers two evolutionary patterns, lock and loop modes, and shows an asymmetry between defense and attack. The defender can lock the game into equilibrium, whereas the attacker can disrupt it by sacrificing short-term utility for longer-term advantage. Six representative numerical examples corroborate the theoretical results and highlight the complexity of possible game outcomes.

Title: Speech Synthesis By Unrolling Diffusion Process using Neural Network Layers
Authors: Peter Ochieng
Abstract: This work introduces UDPNet, a novel architecture designed to accelerate the reverse diffusion process in speech synthesis. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on timestep embeddings and shared network parameters, UDPNet unrolls the reverse diffusion process directly into the network architecture, with successive layers corresponding to equally spaced steps in the diffusion schedule. Each layer progressively refines the noisy input, culminating in a high-fidelity estimation of the original data, \(x_0\). Additionally, we redefine the learning target by predicting latent variables instead of the conventional \(x_0\) or noise \(\epsilon_0\). This shift addresses the common issue of large prediction errors in early denoising stages, effectively reducing speech distortion. Extensive evaluations on single- and multi-speaker datasets demonstrate that UDPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency, while generalizing effectively to unseen speech. These results position UDPNet as a robust solution for real-time speech synthesis applications. Sample audio is available at this https URL.

Title: Structuring Concept Space with the Musical Circle of Fifths by Utilizing Music Grammar Based Activations
Authors: Tofara Moyo
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing similarities between the structure of a discrete neural network, such as a spiking network, and the composition of a piano piece. While both involve nodes or notes that are activated sequentially or in parallel, the latter benefits from the rich body of music theory to guide meaningful combinations. We propose a novel approach that leverages musical grammar to regulate activations in a spiking neural network, allowing for the representation of symbols as attractors. By applying rules for chord progressions from music theory, we demonstrate how certain activations naturally follow others, akin to the concept of attraction. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of modulating keys to navigate different basins of attraction within the network. Ultimately, we show that the map of concepts in our model is structured by the musical circle of fifths, highlighting the potential for leveraging music theory principles in deep learning algorithms.

Title: Building Resilience in Wireless Communication Systems With a Secret-Key Budget
Authors: Karl-Ludwig Besser, Rafael F. Schaefer, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: Resilience and power consumption are two important performance metrics for many modern communication systems, and it is therefore important to define, analyze, and optimize them. In this work, we consider a wireless communication system with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to and used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer resilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we propose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between resilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare constant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a reinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can be minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can be used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters for the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.

Title: Just Project! Multi-Channel Despeckling, the Easy Way
Authors: Loïc Denis (LabHC, IMAGES, IDS), Emanuele Dalsasso (EPFL, IMAGES), Florence Tupin (IMAGES, IDS)
Abstract: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging. This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.

Title: Exploring SSL Discrete Speech Features for Zipformer-based Contextual ASR
Authors: Mingyu Cui, Yifan Yang, Jiajun Deng, Jiawen Kang, Shujie Hu, Tianzi Wang, Zhaoqing Li, Shiliang Zhang, Xie Chen, Xunying Liu
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) based discrete speech representations are highly compact and domain adaptable. In this paper, SSL discrete speech features extracted from WavLM models are used as additional cross-utterance acoustic context features in Zipformer-Transducer ASR systems. The efficacy of replacing Fbank features with discrete token features for modelling either cross-utterance contexts (from preceding and future segments), or current utterance's internal contexts alone, or both at the same time, are demonstrated thoroughly on the Gigaspeech 1000-hr corpus. The best Zipformer-Transducer system using discrete tokens based cross-utterance context features outperforms the baseline using utterance internal context only with statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions of 0.32% to 0.41% absolute (2.78% to 3.54% relative) on the dev and test data. The lowest published WER of 11.15% and 11.14% were obtained on the dev and test sets. Our work is open-source and publicly available at this https URL\_ASR.

Title: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Audio Captioning with Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying and Progressive Learning
Authors: Choi Changin, Lim Sungjun, Rhee Wonjong
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation can improve audio captioning by incorporating relevant audio-text pairs from a knowledge base. Existing methods typically rely solely on the input audio as a unimodal retrieval query. In contrast, we propose Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying, which generates a text description of the input audio to enable multimodal querying. This approach aligns the query modality with the audio-text structure of the knowledge base, leading to more effective retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce a novel progressive learning strategy that gradually increases the number of interleaved audio-text pairs to enhance the training process. Our experiments on AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across these benchmarks.

Title: Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers
Authors: Julian Heinovski, Doğanalp Ergenç, Kirsten Thommes, Falko Dressler
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback
Authors: Namhyun Kim, Juntaek Han, Jinseok Choi, Ahmed Alkhateeb, Chan-Byoung Chae, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To obtain the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed DL CSI, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. Leveraging this, to mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) aided precoder optimization method. This method jointly updates the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.

Title: Convex Data-Driven Contraction With Riemannian Metrics
Authors: Andreas Oliveira, Jian Zheng, Mario Sznaier
Abstract: The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming nonlinearities are Lipschitz bounded in subsets of n dimensional euclidean space. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its potential for robust data-driven contraction.

Title: Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical Applications
Authors: Atonu Ghosh, Devadeep Misra, Hirdesh Mewada
Abstract: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.

Title: Digital Twin Synchronization: Bridging the Sim-RL Agent to a Real-Time Robotic Additive Manufacturing Control
Authors: Matsive Ali, Sandesh Giri, Sen Liu, Qin Yang
Abstract: With the rapid development of deep reinforcement learning technology, it gradually demonstrates excellent potential and is becoming the most promising solution in the robotics. However, in the smart manufacturing domain, there is still not too much research involved in dynamic adaptive control mechanisms optimizing complex processes. This research advances the integration of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with digital twins for industrial robotics applications, providing a framework for enhanced adaptive real-time control for smart additive manufacturing processing. The system architecture combines Unity's simulation environment with ROS2 for seamless digital twin synchronization, while leveraging transfer learning to efficiently adapt trained models across tasks. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm with the proposed hierarchical reward structure to address the common reinforcement learning challenges in two distinct control scenarios. The results show rapid policy convergence and robust task execution in both simulated and physical environments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Summarizing Speech: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Fabian Retkowski, Maike Züfle, Andreas Sudmann, Dinah Pfau, Shinji Watanabe, Jan Niehues, Alexander Waibel
Abstract: Speech summarization has become an essential tool for efficiently managing and accessing the growing volume of spoken and audiovisual content. However, despite its increasing importance, speech summarization remains loosely defined. The field intersects with several research areas, including speech recognition, text summarization, and specific applications like meeting summarization. This survey not only examines existing datasets and evaluation protocols, which are crucial for assessing the quality of summarization approaches, but also synthesizes recent developments in the field, highlighting the shift from traditional systems to advanced models like fine-tuned cascaded architectures and end-to-end solutions. In doing so, we surface the ongoing challenges, such as the need for realistic evaluation benchmarks, multilingual datasets, and long-context handling.

Title: Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux
Authors: Ming Xu, Stephen Gould, Iman Shames
Abstract: We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite-horizon optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. A proof of local quadratic convergence of the IPDDP2 iterates is provided. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on over 500 OCPs derived from five different classes of robotic motion planning problems, three of which are contact-implicit trajectory optimisation problems. IPDDP2 demonstrates improvements in robustness against existing constrained DDP algorithms for contact-implicit planning, while being significantly faster than general-purpose solver IPOPT. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.

Authors: Cihan Xiao, Ruixing Liang, Xiangyu Zhang, Mehmet Emre Tiryaki, Veronica Bae, Lavanya Shankar, Rong Yang, Ethan Poon, Emmanuel Dupoux, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Leibny Paola Garcia Perera
Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our dataset with 100+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection.

Title: Active inference as a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in human drivers
Authors: Julian F. Schumann, Johan Engström, Leif Johnson, Matthew O'Kelly, Joao Messias, Jens Kober, Arkady Zgonnikov
Abstract: Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution. Our results highlight the potential of active inference as a unified framework for understanding and modeling human behavior in complex real-life driving tasks.

Title: Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS
Authors: Keinichi Fujita, Shota Horiguchi, Yusuke Ijima
Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization. Audio examples are available on our demo page (this https URL).

Title: Towards Generalized Source Tracing for Codec-Based Deepfake Speech
Authors: Xuanjun Chen, I-Ming Lin, Lin Zhang, Haibin Wu, Hung-yi Lee, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang
Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

Title: An introduction to pitch strength in contemporary popular music analysis and production
Authors: Emmanuel Deruty
Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production. Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a perspective of perceptual richness.
