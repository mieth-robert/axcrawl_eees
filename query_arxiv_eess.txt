Title: Integrating electrocardiogram and fundus images for early detection of cardiovascular diseases
Authors: K. A. Muthukumar, Dhruva Nandi, Priya Ranjan, Krithika Ramachandran, Shiny PJ, Anirban Ghosh, Ashwini M, Aiswaryah Radhakrishnan, V. E. Dhandapani, Rajiv Janardhanan
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a predominant health concern globally, emphasizing the need for advanced diagnostic techniques. In our research, we present an avant-garde methodology that synergistically integrates ECG readings and retinal fundus images to facilitate the early disease tagging as well as triaging of the CVDs in the order of disease priority. Recognizing the intricate vascular network of the retina as a reflection of the cardiovascular system, alongwith the dynamic cardiac insights from ECG, we sought to provide a holistic diagnostic perspective. Initially, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to both the ECG and fundus images, transforming the data into the frequency domain. Subsequently, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) was computed for the frequency-domain features of both modalities. These EMD values were then concatenated, forming a comprehensive feature set that was fed into a Neural Network classifier. This approach, leveraging the FFT's spectral insights and EMD's capability to capture nuanced data differences, offers a robust representation for CVD classification. Preliminary tests yielded a commendable accuracy of 84 percent, underscoring the potential of this combined diagnostic strategy. As we continue our research, we anticipate refining and validating the model further to enhance its clinical applicability in resource limited healthcare ecosystems prevalent across the Indian sub-continent and also the world at large.

Title: Remote Sensing Based Crop Health Classification Using NDVI and Fully Connected Neural Networks
Authors: J. Judith, R. Tamilselvi, M. Parisa Beham, S. Sathiya Pandiya Lakshmi, Alavikunhu Panthakkan, Saeed Al Mansoori, Hussain Al Ahmad
Abstract: Accurate crop health monitoring is not only essential for improving agricultural efficiency but also for ensuring sustainable food production in the face of environmental challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on visual inspection or simple NDVI measurements, which, though useful, fall short in detecting nuanced variations in crop stress and disease conditions. In this research, we propose a more sophisticated method that leverages NDVI data combined with a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) to classify crop health with greater precision. The FCNN, trained using satellite imagery from various agricultural regions, is capable of identifying subtle distinctions between healthy crops, rust-affected plants, and other stressed conditions. Our approach not only achieved a remarkable classification accuracy of 97.80% but it also significantly outperformed conventional models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-scores. The ability to map the relationship between NDVI values and crop health using deep learning presents new opportunities for real-time, large-scale monitoring of agricultural fields, reducing manual efforts, and offering a scalable solution to address global food security.

Title: PathSeqSAM: Sequential Modeling for Pathology Image Segmentation with SAM2
Authors: Mingyang Zhu, Yinting Liu, Mingyu Li, Jiacheng Wang
Abstract: Current methods for pathology image segmentation typically treat 2D slices independently, ignoring valuable cross-slice information. We present PathSeqSAM, a novel approach that treats 2D pathology slices as sequential video frames using SAM2's memory mechanisms. Our method introduces a distance-aware attention mechanism that accounts for variable physical distances between slices and employs LoRA for domain adaptation. Evaluated on the KPI Challenge 2024 dataset for glomeruli segmentation, PathSeqSAM demonstrates improved segmentation quality, particularly in challenging cases that benefit from cross-slice context. We have publicly released our code at this https URL.

Title: Imaging Transformer for MRI Denoising: a Scalable Model Architecture that enables SNR << 1 Imaging
Authors: Hui Xue, Sarah M. Hooper, Rhodri H. Davies, Thomas A. Treibel, Iain Pierce, John Stairs, Joseph Naegele, Charlotte Manisty, James C. Moon, Adrienne E. Campbell-Washburn, Peter Kellman, Michael S. Hansen
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a flexible and scalable imaging transformer (IT) architecture with three attention modules for multi-dimensional imaging data and apply it to MRI denoising with very low input SNR. Methods: Three independent attention modules were developed: spatial local, spatial global, and frame attentions. They capture long-range signal correlation and bring back the locality of information in images. An attention-cell-block design processes 5D tensors ([B, C, F, H, W]) for 2D, 2D+T, and 3D image data. A High Resolution (HRNet) backbone was built to hold IT blocks. Training dataset consists of 206,677 cine series and test datasets had 7,267 series. Ten input SNR levels from 0.05 to 8.0 were tested. IT models were compared to seven convolutional and transformer baselines. To test scalability, four IT models 27m to 218m parameters were trained. Two senior cardiologists reviewed IT model outputs from which the EF was measured and compared against the ground-truth. Results: IT models significantly outperformed other models over the tested SNR levels. The performance gap was most prominent at low SNR levels. The IT-218m model had the highest SSIM and PSNR, restoring good image quality and anatomical details even at SNR 0.2. Two experts agreed at this SNR or above, the IT model output gave the same clinical interpretation as the ground-truth. The model produced images that had accurate EF measurements compared to ground-truth values. Conclusions: Imaging transformer model offers strong performance, scalability, and versatility for MR denoising. It recovers image quality suitable for confident clinical reading and accurate EF measurement, even at very low input SNR of 0.2.

Title: Secure Estimation of Battery Voltage Under Sensor Attacks: A Self-Learning Koopman Approach
Authors: Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy
Abstract: Cloud-based battery management system (BMS) requires accurate terminal voltage measurement data to ensure optimal and safe charging of Lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the battery terminal voltage data as it passes from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS through the communication network, with the objective of under- or over-charging the battery. To ensure accurate terminal voltage data under such malicious sensor attacks, this paper investigates a Koopman-based secure terminal voltage estimation scheme using a two-stage error-compensated self-learning feedback. During the first stage of error correction, the potential Koopman prediction error is estimated to compensate for the error accumulation due to the linear approximation of Koopman operator. The second stage of error compensation aims to recover the error amassing from the higher-order dynamics of the Lithium-ion batteries missed by the self-learning strategy. Specifically, we have proposed two different methods for this second stage error compensation. First, an interpretable empirical correction strategy has been obtained using the open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for the battery. Second, a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method has been explored. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed secure estimator using both empirical and data-driven corrections.

Title: Secrecy Rate Maximization with Artificial Noise for Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Pigi P. Papanikolaou, Dimitrios Bozanis, Sotiris A. Tegos, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: Security is emerging as a critical performance metric for next-generation wireless networks, but conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems often suffer from severe path loss and are vulnerable to nearby eavesdroppers due to their fixed-antenna configurations. Pinching-antenna systems (PAS) offer a promising alternative, leveraging reconfigurable pinching antennas (PAs) positioned along low-loss dielectric waveguides to enhance channel conditions and dynamically mitigate security threats. In this paper, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-based beamforming scheme for downlink transmissions in PAS, with the goal of maximizing the secrecy rate. A closed-form solution is derived for the single-waveguide scenario, while an alternating optimization approach addresses more complex multiple waveguide setups. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and existing PAS security schemes.

Title: Transfer Learning Assisted XgBoost For Adaptable Cyberattack Detection In Battery Packs
Authors: Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy
Abstract: Optimal charging of electric vehicle (EVs) depends heavily on reliable sensor measurements from the battery pack to the cloud-controller of the smart charging station. However, an adversary could corrupt the voltage sensor data during transmission, potentially causing local to wide-scale disruptions. Therefore, it is essential to detect sensor cyberattacks in real-time to ensure secure EV charging, and the developed algorithms must be readily adaptable to variations, including pack configurations. To tackle these challenges, we propose adaptable fine-tuning of an XgBoost-based cell-level model using limited pack-level data to use for voltage prediction and residual generation. We used battery cell and pack data from high-fidelity charging experiments in PyBaMM and `liionpack' package to train and test the detection algorithm. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated for two large-format battery packs under sensor swapping and replay attacks. The simulation results also highlight the adaptability and efficacy of our proposed detection algorithm.

Title: Correcting Domain Shifts in Electric Motor Vibration Data for Unseen Operating Conditions
Authors: Lesley Wheat, Martin v. Mohrenschildt, Saeid Habibi, Dhafar Al-Ani
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of domain shifts in electric motor vibration data created by new operating conditions in testing scenarios, focusing on bearing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The proposed method combines the Harmonic Feature Space (HFS) with regression to correct for frequency and energy differentials in steady-state data, enabling accurate FDD on unseen operating conditions within the range of the training conditions. The HFS aligns harmonics across different operating frequencies, while regression compensates for energy variations, preserving the relative magnitude of vibrations critical for fault detection. The proposed approach is evaluated on a detection problem using experimental data from a Belt-Starter Generator (BSG) electric motor, with test conditions having a minimum 1000 RPM and 5 Nm difference from training conditions. Results demonstrate that the method outperforms traditional analysis techniques, achieving high classification accuracy at a 94% detection rate and effectively reducing domain shifts. The approach is computationally efficient, requires only healthy data for training, and is well-suited for real-world applications where the exact application operating conditions cannot be predetermined.

Title: GPS-Independent Localization Techniques for Disaster Rescue
Authors: Yingquan Li, Bodhibrata Mukhopadhyay, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: In this article, we present the limitations of traditional localization techniques, such as those using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and life detectors, in localizing victims during disaster rescue efforts. These techniques usually fall short in accuracy, coverage, and robustness to environmental interference. We then discuss the necessary requirements for developing GPS-independent localization techniques in disaster scenarios. Practical techniques should be passive, with straightforward hardware, low computational demands, low power, and high accuracy, while incorporating unknown environmental information. We review various implementation strategies for these techniques, categorized by measurements (time, angle, and signal strength) and operation manners (non-cooperative and cooperative). Case studies demonstrate trade-offs between localization accuracy and complexity, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate localization techniques based on resources and rescue needs for efficient disaster response.

Title: Spectrum Sharing in STAR-RIS-assisted UAV with NOMA for Cognitive Radio Networks
Authors: Ali Nazari, Ali Olfat
Abstract: As an emerging technology, the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks by mitigating the interference of the incident signals. The STAR-RIS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fully cover the dynamic environment through high mobility and fast deployment. According to the dynamic air-to-ground channels, the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV may face a challenge configuring their elements' coefficients (i.e., reflecting and transmitting the amplitude and phases). Hence, to meet the requirements of dynamic channel determination with the SE approach, this paper proposes the sum rate maximization of both PUs and SUs through non-orthogonal multiple access in CR network to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission-reflection beamforming design of the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV, and power allocation. Since the non-convex joint optimization problem includes coupled optimization variables, we develop an alternative optimization algorithm. Simulation results study the impact of: 1) the significant parameters, 2) the performance of different intelligence surface modes and STAR-RIS operating protocols, 3) the joint trajectory and beamforming design with fixed and mobile users, and 4) STAR-RIS capabilities such as mitigating the interference, and how variations in the roles of elements dynamically.

Title: Neyman-Pearson Detector for Ambient Backscatter Zero-Energy-Devices Beacons
Authors: Shanglin Yang, Jean-Marie Gorce, Muhammad Jehangir Khan, Dinh-Thuy Phan-Huy, Guillaume Villemaud
Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low power indoor wireless positioning system has been proposed. In this system, Zero-Energy-Devices (ZED) beacons are deployed in Indoor environments, and located on a map with unique broadcast identifiers. They harvest ambient energy to power themselves and backscatter ambient waves from cellular networks to send their identifiers. This paper presents a novel detection method for ZEDs in ambient backscatter systems, with an emphasis on performance evaluation through experimental setups and simulations. We introduce a Neyman-Pearson detection framework, which leverages a predefined false alarm probability to determine the optimal detection threshold. This method, applied to the analysis of backscatter signals in a controlled testbed environment, incorporates the use of BC sequences to enhance signal detection accuracy. The experimental setup, conducted on the FIT/CorteXlab testbed, employs a two-node configuration for signal transmission and reception. Key performance metrics, which is the peak-to-lobe ratio, is evaluated, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed detection model. The results demonstrate a detection system that effectively handles varying noise levels and identifies ZEDs with high reliability. The simulation results show the robustness of the model, highlighting its capacity to achieve desired detection performance even with stringent false alarm thresholds. This work paves the way for robust ZED detection in real-world scenarios, contributing to the advancement of wireless communication technologies.

Title: Multi-Stream Transmission in Cell-Free MIMO Networks with Coherent AP Clustering
Authors: Esra Aycan Beyazıt, Jeroen Famaey, Nina Slamnik-Kriještorac, Johann M. Marquez-Barja, Miguel Camelo Botero
Abstract: This letter proposes a multi-stream selection framework for \ac{CF-MIMO} networks. Partially coherent transmission has been considered by clustering \acp{AP} into phase-aligned clusters to address the challenges of phase misalignment and inter-cluster interference. A novel stream selection algorithm is developed to dynamically allocate multiple streams to each multi-antenna \ac{UE}, ensuring that the system optimizes the sum rate while minimizing inter-cluster and inter-stream interference. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectral efficiency and fairness in distributed \ac{CF-MIMO} networks.

Title: Vehicle Dynamics Control for Simultaneous Optimization of Tire Emissions and Performance in EVs
Authors: Chi-Bach Pham, Homayoun Hamedmoghadam Rafati, Robert Noel Shorten
Abstract: In recent years, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have seen widespread public adoption. While EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, they contribute to an increase in another type of vehicular emission: tire emissions. Battery-operated EVs are generally heavier than their combustion-engine counterparts and require greater acceleration forces, which their high-torque electric motors provide. This combination of increased weight and traction forces leads to higher tire emissions, which possess various adverse health and environmental effects. Here, we propose a control solution with promising results in mitigating tire wear in all-wheel-drive EVs. The idea is to utilize different tire profiles on each drive axis: a low-wear, low-traction axis and a high-wear, high-traction axis. Derived from detailed mathematical analyses, we propose a simple control scheme to counteract the performance difference from using the low-traction tires. The proposed control mechanism then distributes torque optimally between the two axes, maximizing usage from the low-wear axis and simultaneously maintaining stability and performance by leveraging high-traction tires. Through detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the developed model significantly reduces tire emissions and maintains vehicle drivability and performance.

Title: Generative and Explainable AI for High-Dimensional Channel Estimation
Authors: Nghia Thinh Nguyen, Tri Nhu Do
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new adversarial training framework to address high-dimensional instantaneous channel estimation in wireless communications. Specifically, we train a generative adversarial network to predict a channel realization in the time-frequency-space domain, in which the generator exploits the third-order moment of the input in its loss function and applies a new reparameterization method for latent distribution learning to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the true and estimated channel distributions. Next, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence mechanism to examine how the critic discriminates the generated channel. We demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing methods in terms of minimizing estimation errors. Additionally, we find that the critic's attention focuses on the high-power portion of the channel's time-frequency representation.

Title: ACSNet: A Deep Neural Network for Compound GNSS Jamming Signal Classification
Authors: Min Jiang, Ziqiang Ye, Yue Xiao, Yulan Gao, Ming Xiao, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), identifying not only single but also compound jamming signals is crucial for ensuring reliable navigation and positioning, particularly in future wireless communication scenarios such as the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). However, conventional techniques often struggle with low recognition accuracy and high computational complexity, especially under low jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) conditions. To overcome the challenge of accurately identifying compound jamming signals embedded within GNSS signals, we propose ACSNet, a novel convolutional neural network designed specifically for this purpose. Unlike traditional methods that tend to exhibit lower accuracy and higher computational demands, particularly in low JNR environments, ACSNet addresses these issues by integrating asymmetric convolution blocks, which enhance its sensitivity to subtle signal variations. Simulations demonstrate that ACSNet significantly improves accuracy in low JNR regions and shows robust resilience to power ratio (PR) variations, confirming its effectiveness and efficiency for practical GNSS interference management applications.

Title: Efficient and Robust Remote Sensing Image Denoising Using Randomized Approximation of Geodesics' Gramian on the Manifold Underlying the Patch Space
Authors: Kelum Gajamannage, Dilhani I. Jayathilake, Maria Vasilyeva
Abstract: Remote sensing images are widely utilized in many disciplines such as feature recognition and scene semantic segmentation. However, due to environmental factors and the issues of the imaging system, the image quality is often degraded which may impair subsequent visual tasks. Even though denoising remote sensing images plays an essential role before applications, the current denoising algorithms fail to attain optimum performance since these images possess complex features in the texture. Denoising frameworks based on artificial neural networks have shown better performance; however, they require exhaustive training with heterogeneous samples that extensively consume resources like power, memory, computation, and latency. Thus, here we present a computationally efficient and robust remote sensing image denoising method that doesn't require additional training samples. This method partitions patches of a remote-sensing image in which a low-rank manifold, representing the noise-free version of the image, underlies the patch space. An efficient and robust approach to revealing this manifold is a randomized approximation of the singular value spectrum of the geodesics' Gramian matrix of the patch space. The method asserts a unique emphasis on each color channel during denoising so the three denoised channels are merged to produce the final image.

Title: Uplink Assisted Joint Channel Estimation and CSI Feedback: An Approach Based on Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding
Authors: Yiran Guo, Wei Chen, Bo Ai
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, the acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) is essential for maximizing spatial resource utilization and improving system spectral efficiency. The separate design of modules in AI-based CSI feedback architectures under traditional modular communication frameworks, including channel estimation (CE), CSI compression and feedback, leads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an uplink assisted joint CE and and CSI feedback approach via deep learning for downlink CSI acquisition, which mitigates performance degradation caused by distribution bias across separately trained modules in traditional modular communication frameworks. The proposed network adopts a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) architecture to mitigate the cliff effect encountered in the conventional separate source-channel coding. Furthermore, we exploit the uplink CSI as auxiliary information to enhance CSI reconstruction accuracy by leveraging the partial reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels in FDD systems, without introducing additional overhead. The effectiveness of uplink CSI as assisted information and the necessity of an end-toend multi-module joint training architecture is validated through comprehensive ablation and scalability experiments.

Title: Virtual Contraction Approach to Decentralized Adaptive Stabilization of Nonlinear Time-Delayed Networks
Authors: Yu Kawano, Zhiyong Sun
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize a diagonally dominant structure for the decentralized stabilization of unknown nonlinear time-delayed networks. Generalizing the idea of virtual contraction analysis to time-delayed systems, we demonstrate that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized by diagonal high-gains if the input matrices possess certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant properties. To achieve stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, ensuring that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is verified in a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.

Title: Low-Overhead Channel Estimation Framework for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication
Authors: Rui Wang, Shuowen Zhang, Bruno Clerckx, Liang Liu
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) refers to a family of RIS architectures characterized by scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal and enables higher wave manipulation flexibility and large performance gains over conventional (diagonal) RIS. To achieve those promising gains, accurate channel state information (CSI) needs to be acquired in BD-RIS assisted communication systems. However, the number of coefficients in the cascaded channels to be estimated in BD-RIS assisted systems is significantly larger than that in conventional RIS assisted systems, because the channels associated with the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix have to be estimated as well. Surprisingly, for the first time in the literature, this paper rigorously shows that the uplink channel estimation overhead in BD-RIS assisted systems is actually of the same order as that in the conventional RIS assisted systems. This amazing result stems from a key observation: for each user antenna, its cascaded channel matrix associated with one reference BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-base station (BS) channel. In other words, the number of independent unknown variables is far less than it would seem at first glance. Building upon this property, this paper manages to characterize the minimum overhead to perfectly estimate all the channels in the ideal case without noise at the BS, and propose a twophase estimation framework for the practical case with noise at the BS. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding channel estimation overhead reduction over existing schemes in BD-RIS assisted systems.

Title: A Signal Matrix-Based Local Flaw Detection Framework for Steel Wire Ropes Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Siyu You, Leilei Yang, Zixu Kuang, Huayi Gou, Longlong Zhang, Zhiliang Liu
Abstract: Steel wire ropes (SWRs) are critical load-bearing components in industrial applications, yet their structural integrity is often compromised by local flaws (LFs). Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) is a widely used non-destructive testing method that detects defects by measuring perturbations in magnetic fields. Traditional MFL detection methods suffer from critical limitations: one-dimensional approaches fail to capture spatial relationships across sensor channels, while multi-dimensional image-based techniques introduce interpolation artifacts and computational inefficiencies. This paper proposes a novel detection framework based on signal matrices, directly processing raw multi-channel MFL signals using a specialized Convolutional Neural Network for signal matrix as input (SM-CNN). The architecture incorporates stripe pooling to preserve channel-wise features and symmetric padding to improve boundary defect detection. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.74% accuracy and 97.85% recall. Additionally, it demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency, processing at 87.72 frames per second (FPS) with a low inference latency of 2.6ms and preprocessing time of 8.8ms. With only 1.48 million parameters, this lightweight design supports real-time processing, establishing a new benchmark for SWR inspection in industrial settings.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of tissue perfusion is crucial in visceral surgery, especially during anastomosis. Currently, subjective visual judgment is commonly employed in clinical settings. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a non-invasive, quantitative alternative. However, HSI imaging lacks continuous integration into the clinical workflow. This study presents a hyperspectral light field system for intraoperative tissue oxygen saturation (SO2) analysis and visualization. We present a correlation method for determining SO2 saturation with low computational demands. We demonstrate clinical application, with our results aligning with the perfusion boundaries determined by the surgeon. We perform and compare continuous perfusion analysis using two hyperspectral cameras (Cubert S5, Cubert X20), achieving processing times of < 170 ms and < 400 ms, respectively. We discuss camera characteristics, system parameters, and the suitability for clinical use and real-time applications.

Title: Offset-free Nonlinear MPC with Koopman-based Surrogate Models
Authors: Irene Schimperna, Lea Bold, Karl Worthmann
Abstract: In this paper, we design offset-free nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for surrogate models based on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). The model used for prediction in MPC is augmented with a disturbance term, that is estimated by an observer. If the full information about the equilibrium of the real system is not available, a reference calculator is introduced in the algorithm to compute the MPC state and input references. The control algorithm guarantees offset-free tracking of the controlled output under the assumption that the modeling errors are asymptotically constant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is showcased with numerical simulations for two popular benchmark systems: the van-der-Pol oscillator and the four-tanks process.

Title: A Linear Push-Pull Average Consensus Algorithm for Delay-Prone Networks
Authors: Evagoras Makridis, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems for possibly unbalanced and delay-prone networks with directional information flow. We propose a linear distributed algorithm (referred to as RPPAC) that handles asynchronous updates and time-varying heterogeneous information delays. Our proposed distributed algorithm utilizes a surplus-consensus mechanism and information regarding the number of incoming and outgoing links to guarantee state averaging, despite the imbalanced and delayed information flow in directional networks. The convergence of the RPPAC algorithm is examined using key properties of the backward product of time-varying matrices that correspond to different snapshots of the directional augmented network.

Title: Distributed Optimization with Gradient Tracking over Heterogeneous Delay-Prone Directed Networks
Authors: Evagoras Makridis, Gabriele Oliva, Kasagatta Ramesh Narahari, Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Usman A. Khan, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed optimization problem over unidirectional networks with possibly time-invariant heterogeneous bounded transmission delays. In particular, we propose a modified version of the Accelerated Distributed Directed OPTimization (ADD-OPT) algorithm, herein called Robustified ADD-OPT (R-ADD-OPT), which is able to solve the distributed optimization problem, even when the communication links suffer from heterogeneous but bounded transmission delays. We show that if the gradient step-size of the R-ADD-OPT algorithm is within a certain range, which also depends on the maximum time delay in the network, then the nodes are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem. The range of the gradient step-size that guarantees convergence can be computed a priori based on the maximum time delay in the network.

Title: AgentPolyp: Accurate Polyp Segmentation via Image Enhancement Agent
Authors: Pu Wang, Zhihua Zhang, Dianjie Lu, Guijuan Zhang, Youshan Zhang, Zhuoran Zheng
Abstract: Since human and environmental factors interfere, captured polyp images usually suffer from issues such as dim lighting, blur, and overexposure, which pose challenges for downstream polyp segmentation tasks. To address the challenges of noise-induced degradation in polyp images, we present AgentPolyp, a novel framework integrating CLIP-based semantic guidance and dynamic image enhancement with a lightweight neural network for segmentation. The agent first evaluates image quality using CLIP-driven semantic analysis (e.g., identifying ``low-contrast polyps with vascular textures") and adapts reinforcement learning strategies to dynamically apply multi-modal enhancement operations (e.g., denoising, contrast adjustment). A quality assessment feedback loop optimizes pixel-level enhancement and segmentation focus in a collaborative manner, ensuring robust preprocessing before neural network segmentation. This modular architecture supports plug-and-play extensions for various enhancement algorithms and segmentation networks, meeting deployment requirements for endoscopic devices.

Title: Steering Feedback in Dynamic Driving Simulators: Road-Induced and Non-Road-Induced Harshness
Authors: Maximilian Böhle, Bernhard Schick, Steffen Müller
Abstract: Steering feedback plays a substantial role in the validity of driving simulators for the virtual development of modern vehicles. Established objective steering characteristics typically assess the feedback behavior in the frequency range of up to 30 Hz while factors such as steering wheel and vehicle body vibrations at higher frequencies are mainly approached as comfort issues. This work investigates the influence of steering wheel and vehicle body excitations in the frequency range between 30 and 100 Hz on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in a dynamic driving simulator. A controlled subject study with 42 participants was performed to compare a reference vehicle with an electrical power steering system to four variants of its virtual representation on a dynamic driving simulator. The effects of road-induced excitations were investigated by comparing a semi-empirical and a physics-based tire model, while the influence of non-road-induced excitations was investigated by implementing engine and wheel orders. The simulator variants were evaluated in comparison to the reference vehicle during closed-loop driving on a country road in a single-blind within-subjects design. The subjective evaluation focused on the perception of road feedback compared to the reference vehicle. The statistical analysis of subjective results shows that there is a strong effect of non-road-induced steering and vehicle body excitations, while the effect of road-induced excitations is considerably less pronounced.

Title: Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Secure Wireless Communications
Authors: Jingjing Zhao, Haowen Song, Xidong Mu, Kaiquan Cai, Yanbo Zhu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based secure communication system is investigated, where a base station equipped with a CAPA transmits signals to a legitimate user under the existence of an eavesdropper. For improving the secrecy performance, the artificial noise (AN) is employed at the BS for the jamming purpose. We aim at maximizing the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the information-bearing and AN source current patterns, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. To solve the resultant non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, a channel subspace-based approach is first proposed via exploiting the result that the optimal current patterns always lie within the subspace spanned by all users' channel responses. Then, the intractable CAPA continuous source current pattern design problem with an infinite number of optimization variables is equivalently transformed into the channel-subspace weighting factor optimization problem with a finite number of optimization variables. A penalty-based successive convex approximation method is developed for iteratively optimizing the finite-size weighting vectors. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose a two-stage source current patterns design scheme. Specifically, the information-bearing and AN patterns are first designed using the maximal ration transmission and zero-forcing transmission, respectively. Then, the remaining power allocation is addressed via the one-dimensional search method. Numerical results unveil that 1) the CAPA brings in significant secrecy rate gain compared to the conventional discrete multiple-input multiple-output; 2) the proposed channel subspace-based algorithm outperforms the conventional Fourier-based approach, while sustaining much lower computational complexity; and 3) the two-stage ZF-MRT approach has negligible performance loss for the large transmit power regime.

Title: A mixed-integer framework for analyzing neural network-based controllers for piecewise affine systems with bounded disturbances
Authors: Dieter Teichrib, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: We present a method for representing the closed-loop dynamics of piecewise affine (PWA) systems with bounded additive disturbances and neural network-based controllers as mixed-integer (MI) linear constraints. We show that such representations enable the computation of robustly positively invariant (RPI) sets for the specified system class by solving MI linear programs. These RPI sets can subsequently be used to certify stability and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, the approach allows to handle non-linear systems based on suitable PWA approximations and corresponding error bounds, which can be interpreted as the bounded disturbances from above.

Title: A Fully Asynchronous Unsourced Random Access Scheme
Authors: Mert Ozates, Mohammad Kazemi, Gianluigi Liva, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: We investigate fully asynchronous unsourced random access (URA), and propose a high-performing scheme that employs on-off division multiple access (ODMA). In this scheme, active users distribute their data over the transmit block based on a sparse transmission pattern without any limitations on the starting time. At the receiver side, we adopt a double sliding-window decoding approach, utilizing a smaller inner decoding window of two block lengths within a larger outer window to enhance the interference cancellation process. Within the inner window, the receiver iteratively applies preamble-free joint starting time and pattern detection, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation operations. A notable feature of the proposed scheme is its elimination of the need for a preamble for starting time detection; this is achieved using ODMA transmission patterns. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous URA scheme outperforms existing alternatives.

Title: Scalable Transceiver Design for Multi-User Communication in FDD Massive MIMO Systems via Deep Learning
Authors: Lin Zhu, Weifeng Zhu, Shuowen Zhang, Shuguang Cui, Liang Liu
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint transceiver design, including pilot transmission, channel feature extraction and feedback, as well as precoding, for low-overhead downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems. Although deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in tackling this problem, existing methods often suffer from poor scalability in practical systems, as the solution obtained in the training phase merely works for a fixed feedback capacity and a fixed number of users in the deployment phase. To address this limitation, we propose a novel DL-based framework comprised of choreographed neural networks, which can utilize one training phase to generate all the transceiver solutions used in the deployment phase with varying sizes of feedback codebooks and numbers of users. The proposed framework includes a residual vector-quantized variational autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) for efficient channel feedback and an edge graph attention network (EGAT) for robust multiuser precoding. It can adapt to different feedback capacities by flexibly adjusting the RVQ codebook sizes using the hierarchical codebook structure, and scale with the number of users through a feedback module sharing scheme and the inherent scalability of EGAT. Moreover, a progressive training strategy is proposed to further enhance data transmission performance and generalization capability. Numerical results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superior scalability and performance of our approach over existing methods.

Title: Guided Wave-Based Structural Awareness Under Varying Operating States via Manifold Representations
Authors: Yiming Fan, Dimitris G Giovanis, Fotis Kopsaftopoulos
Abstract: Guided wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) remains a powerful strategy for identifying early-stage defects and safeguarding vital aerospace structures. Yet, its practical use is often hindered by the enormous, high-dimensional data streams produced by sensor arrays operating at megahertz sampling rates, coupled with the added complexity of shifts in environmental and operational conditions (EOCs). Studies have explored various data-compression approaches that retain critical diagnostic details in a lower-dimensional latent space. While conventional techniques can streamline dimensionality to some extent, they do not always capture the nonlinear interactions typical of guided waves. Manifold learning, as illustrated by Diffusion Maps, tackles these nonlinearities by deriving low-dimensional embeddings directly from wave signals, minimizing the need for manual feature extraction. In parallel, developments in deep learning -- particularly autoencoders -- provide an encoder-decoder model for both data compression and reconstruction. Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been particularly effective for guided wave applications. However, current methods can still struggle to maintain accurate state estimation under changing EOCs, and they are often limited to a single task. In response, the proposed framework adopts a two-fold strategy: it compresses high-dimensional signals into lower-dimensional representations and then leverages those representations to both estimate structural states and reconstruct the original data, even as conditions vary. Applied to two real-world SHM use-cases, this integrated method has proven its ability to preserve and retrieve key damage signatures under noise, shifting operational parameters, and other complicating factors.

Title: Physics-Aware Initialization Refinement in Code-Aided EM for Blind Channel Estimation
Authors: Chin-Hung Chen, Ivana Nikoloska, Wim van Houtum, Yan Wu, Alex Alvarado
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-known local maximum problem of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in blind intersymbol interference (ISI) channel estimation. This problem primarily results from phase and shift ambiguity during initialization, which blind estimation is inherently unable to distinguish. We propose an effective initialization refinement algorithm that utilizes the decoder output as a model selection metric, incorporating a technique to detect phase and shift ambiguity. Our results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of local maximum cases to nearly one-third for a 3-tap ISI channel under highly uncertain initial conditions. The improvement becomes more pronounced as initial errors increase and the channel memory grows. When used in a turbo equalizer, the proposed algorithm is required only in the first turbo iteration, which limits any complexity increase with subsequent iterations.

Title: Respiratory Inhaler Sound Event Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning
Authors: Davoud Shariat Panah, Alessandro N Franciosi, Cormac McCarthy, Andrew Hines
Abstract: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While this condition can be managed by administering controller medications through handheld inhalers, clinical studies have shown low adherence to the correct inhaler usage technique. Consequently, many patients may not receive the full benefit of their medication. Automated classification of inhaler sounds has recently been studied to assess medication adherence. However, the existing classification models were typically trained using data from specific inhaler types, and their ability to generalize to sounds from different inhalers remains unexplored. In this study, we adapted the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised learning model for inhaler sound classification by pre-training and fine-tuning this model on inhaler sounds. The proposed model shows a balanced accuracy of 98% on a dataset collected using a dry powder inhaler and smartwatch device. The results also demonstrate that re-finetuning this model on minimal data from a target inhaler is a promising approach to adapting a generic inhaler sound classification model to a different inhaler device and audio capture hardware. This is the first study in the field to demonstrate the potential of smartwatches as assistive technologies for the personalized monitoring of inhaler adherence using machine learning models.

Title: Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems -- Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning
Authors: Hannes Petrenz, Johannes Köhler, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach iteratively refines the parameter estimates using set membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to an existing robust adaptive MPC approach.

Title: Balancing hydrogen delivery in national energy systems: impact of the temporal flexibility of hydrogen delivery on export prices
Authors: Hazem Abdel-Khalek, Eddy Jalbout, Caspar Schauß, Benjamin Pfluger
Abstract: Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in the energy transition. Analyses exploring the price of hydrogen usually calculate average or marginal production costs regardless of the time of delivery. A key factor that affects the price of hydrogen is the balancing costs, which we define as the expense of ensuring a steady schedule of hydrogen delivery. We explore the effect of delivering hydrogen to the export ports at different schedules, ranging from fully flexible to moderately stable with a daily and weekly buffer, to fully stable. We quantify the rise in hydrogen price with strict balancing constraint in three countries: Brazil, Morocco and Turkey, and three export volumes: 10, 50 and 200 TWh. The price difference between the flexible and stable schedules was found to reach a maximum of 36% in Brazil, 47% in Morocco and 18% in Turkey across the different export volumes.

Title: Efficient Medical Image Restoration via Reliability Guided Learning in Frequency Domain
Authors: Pengcheng Zheng, Kecheng Chen, Jiaxin Huang, Bohao Chen, Ju Liu, Yazhou Ren, Xiaorong Pu
Abstract: Medical image restoration tasks aim to recover high-quality images from degraded observations, exhibiting emergent desires in many clinical scenarios, such as low-dose CT image denoising, MRI super-resolution, and MRI artifact removal. Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Title: Multi-Orbiter Continuous Lunar Beaming
Authors: Baris Donmez, Yanni Jiwan-Mercier, Sebastien Loranger, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: In this work, free-space optics-based continuous wireless power transmission between multiple low lunar orbit satellites and a solar panel on the lunar rover located at the lunar south pole are investigated based on the time-varying harvested power and overall system efficiency metrics. The performances are compared between a solar panel with the tracking ability and a fixed solar panel that induces \textit{the cosine effect} due to the time-dependent angle of incidence (AoI). In our work, the Systems Tool Kit (STK) high-precision orbit propagator, which calculates the ephemeris data precisely, is utilized. Interestingly, orbiter deployments in constellations change significantly during a Moon revolution; thus, short-duration simulations cannot be used straightforwardly. In our work, many satellite configurations are assessed to be able to find a Cislunar constellation that establishes a continuous line-of-sight (LoS) between the solar panel and at least a single LLO satellite. It is found that 40-satellite schemes enable the establishment of a continuous WPT system model. Besides, a satellite selection method (SSM) is introduced so that only the best LoS link among multiple simultaneous links from multiple satellites will be active for optimum efficiency. Our benchmark system of a 40-satellite quadruple orbit scheme is compared with 30-satellite and a single satellite schemes based on the average harvested powers and overall system efficiencies 27.3 days so the trade-off options can be assessed from the multiple Cislunar models. The outcomes show that the average system efficiencies of single, 30-satellite, and 40-satellite schemes are 2.84%, 32.33%, and 33.29%, respectively, for the tracking panel and 0.97%, 18.33%, and 20.44%, respectively, for the fixed solar panel case.

Title: Sensitivity Analysis of State Space Models for Scrap Composition Estimation in EAF and BOF
Authors: Yiqing Zhou, Karsten Naert, Dirk Nuyens
Abstract: This study develops and analyzes linear and nonlinear state space models for estimating the elemental composition of scrap steel used in steelmaking, with applications to Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) processes. The models incorporate mass balance equations and are fitted using a modified Kalman filter for linear cases and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for nonlinear cases. Using Cu and Cr as representative elements, we assess the sensitivity of model predictions to measurement noise in key process variables, including steel mass, steel composition, scrap input mass, slag mass, and iron oxide fraction in slag. Results show that the models are robust to moderate noise levels in most variables, particularly when errors are below $10\%$. However, accuracy significantly deteriorates with noise in slag mass estimation. These findings highlight the practical feasibility and limitations of applying state space models for real-time scrap composition estimation in industrial settings.

Title: Neural Networks for on-chip Model Predictive Control: a Method to Build Optimized Training Datasets and its application to Type-1 Diabetes
Authors: Alberto Castillo, Elliot Pryor, Anas El Fathi, Boris Kovatchev, Marc Breton
Abstract: Training Neural Networks (NNs) to behave as Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms is an effective way to implement them in constrained embedded devices. By collecting large amounts of input-output data, where inputs represent system states and outputs are MPC-generated control actions, NNs can be trained to replicate MPC behavior at a fraction of the computational cost. However, although the composition of the training data critically influences the final NN accuracy, methods for systematically optimizing it remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Optimally-Sampled Datasets (OSDs) as ideal training sets and present an efficient algorithm for generating them. An OSD is a parametrized subset of all the available data that (i) preserves existing MPC information up to a certain numerical resolution, (ii) avoids duplicate or near-duplicate states, and (iii) becomes saturated or complete. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OSDs by training NNs to replicate the University of Virginia's MPC algorithm for automated insulin delivery in Type-1 Diabetes, achieving a four-fold improvement in final accuracy. Notably, two OSD-trained NNs received regulatory clearance for clinical testing as the first NN-based control algorithm for direct human insulin dosing. This methodology opens new pathways for implementing advanced optimizations on resource-constrained embedded platforms, potentially revolutionizing how complex algorithms are deployed.

Authors: Yongkang Huo, Fuvio Forni, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: We present a novel framework for central pattern generator design that leverages the intrinsic rebound excitability of neurons in combination with winner-takes-all computation. Our approach unifies decision-making and rhythmic pattern generation within a simple yet powerful network architecture that employs all-to-all inhibitory connections enhanced by designable excitatory interactions. This design offers significant advantages regarding ease of implementation, adaptability, and robustness. We demonstrate its efficacy through a ring oscillator model, which exhibits adaptive phase and frequency modulation, making the framework particularly promising for applications in neuromorphic systems and robotics.

Title: Ring Artifacts Correction Based on Global-Local Features Interaction Guidance in the Projection Domain
Authors: Yunze Liu, Congyi Su, Xing Zhao
Abstract: Ring artifacts are common artifacts in CT imaging, typically caused by inconsistent responses of detector units to X-rays, resulting in stripe artifacts in the projection data. Under circular scanning mode, such artifacts manifest as concentric rings radiating from the center of rotation, severely degrading image quality. In the Radon transform domain, even if the object's density function is piecewise discontinuous in certain regions, the projection images remain nearly continuous in the angular direction, making the ideal projections exhibit a smooth global low-frequency characteristic. In practical scanning, the local disturbances of the same detector unit at different scanning angles lead to a prominent high-frequency locality of stripe artifacts. Existing studies generally model ring artifacts disturbances as fixed additive errors, which overlooks the dynamic variation of detector responses during practical scanning. However, the degree of detector response inconsistency is a function of the projection values, as revealed in our experiments, thereby requiring consideration of the interaction between global and local features in the process of stripe artifacts extraction and correction. Therefore, we propose a CT ring artifacts correction method based on global and local features in the projection domain. We employ the VSS block and Dense block to respectively correct the low-frequency sub-band, which capture the global correlations of the projection, and the high-frequency sub-band, which contain local stripe artifacts after wavelet decomposition. Specifically, the accuracy of artifacts correction is enhanced by the interaction guidance between global and local features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, verifying its robustness and practical applicability.

Title: eXplainable AI for data driven control: an inverse optimal control approach
Authors: Federico Porcari, Donatello Materassi, Simone Formentin
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of black-box data-driven controllers is a key challenge in modern control design. In this work, we propose an eXplainable AI (XAI) methodology based on Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) to obtain local explanations for the behavior of a controller operating around a given region. Specifically, we extract the weights assigned to tracking errors and control effort in the implicit cost function that a black-box controller is optimizing, offering a more transparent and interpretable representation of the controller's underlying objectives. This approach presents connections with well-established XAI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) since it is still based on a local approximation of the control policy. However, rather being limited to a standard sensitivity analysis, the explanation provided by our method relies on the solution of an inverse Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem, offering a structured and more control-relevant perspective. Numerical examples demonstrate that the inferred cost function consistently provides a deeper understanding of the controller's decision-making process, shedding light on otherwise counterintuitive or unexpected phenomena.

Title: Exploring Generative AI Techniques in Government: A Case Study
Authors: Sunyi Liu, Mengzhe Geng, Rebecca Hart
Abstract: The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.

Title: H3AE: High Compression, High Speed, and High Quality AutoEncoder for Video Diffusion Models
Authors: Yushu Wu, Yanyu Li, Ivan Skorokhodov, Anil Kag, Willi Menapace, Sharath Girish, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Yanzhi Wang, Sergey Tulyakov
Abstract: Autoencoder (AE) is the key to the success of latent diffusion models for image and video generation, reducing the denoising resolution and improving efficiency. However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time on mobile devices. We also unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single network. In addition, we find that the widely adopted discriminative losses, i.e., GAN, LPIPS, and DWT losses, provide no significant improvements when training AEs at scale. We propose a novel latent consistency loss that does not require complicated discriminator design or hyperparameter tuning, but provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Our AE achieves an ultra-high compression ratio and real-time decoding speed on mobile while outperforming prior art in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.

Title: Will AI shape the way we speak? The emerging sociolinguistic influence of synthetic voices
Authors: Éva Székely, Jūra Miniota, Míša (Michaela)Hejná
Abstract: The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.

Title: HyRRT-Connect: Bidirectional Motion Planning for Hybrid Dynamical Systems
Authors: Nan Wang, Ricardo G. Sanfelice
Abstract: This paper proposes a bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm to solve the motion planning problem for hybrid systems. The proposed algorithm, called HyRRT-Connect, propagates in both forward and backward directions in hybrid time until an overlap between the forward and backward propagation results is detected. Then, HyRRT-Connect constructs a motion plan through the reversal and concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, ensuring that the motion plan satisfies the given hybrid dynamics. To address the potential discontinuity along the flow caused by tolerating some distance between the forward and backward partial motion plans, we reconstruct the backward partial motion plan by a forward-in-hybrid-time simulation from the final state of the forward partial motion plan. effectively eliminating the discontinuity. The proposed algorithm is applied to an actuated bouncing ball system and a walking robot example to highlight its computational improvement.

Title: HippoMM: Hippocampal-inspired Multimodal Memory for Long Audiovisual Event Understanding
Authors: Yueqian Lin, Qinsi Wang, Hancheng Ye, Yuzhe Fu, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen
Abstract: Comprehending extended audiovisual experiences remains a fundamental challenge for computational systems. Current approaches struggle with temporal integration and cross-modal associations that humans accomplish effortlessly through hippocampal-cortical networks. We introduce HippoMM, a biologically-inspired architecture that transforms hippocampal mechanisms into computational advantages for multimodal understanding. HippoMM implements three key innovations: (i) hippocampus-inspired pattern separation and completion specifically designed for continuous audiovisual streams, (ii) short-to-long term memory consolidation that transforms perceptual details into semantic abstractions, and (iii) cross-modal associative retrieval pathways enabling modality-crossing queries. Unlike existing retrieval systems with static indexing schemes, HippoMM dynamically forms integrated episodic representations through adaptive temporal segmentation and dual-process memory encoding. Evaluations on our challenging HippoVlog benchmark demonstrate that HippoMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (78.2% vs. 64.2% accuracy) while providing substantially faster response times (20.4s vs. 112.5s). Our results demonstrate that translating neuroscientific memory principles into computational architectures provides a promising foundation for next-generation multimodal understanding systems.

Title: Adaptive Synaptogenesis Implemented on a Nanomagnetic Platform
Authors: Faiyaz Elahi Mullick, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay, Rob Baxter, Tony J. Ragucci, Avik W. Ghosh
Abstract: The human brain functions very differently from artificial neural networks (ANN) and possesses unique features that are absent in ANN. An important one among them is "adaptive synaptogenesis" that modifies synaptic weights when needed to avoid catastrophic forgetting and promote lifelong learning. The key aspect of this algorithm is supervised Hebbian learning, where weight modifications in the neocortex driven by temporal coincidence are further accepted or vetoed by an added control mechanism from the hippocampus during the training cycle, to make distant synaptic connections highly sparse and strategic. In this work, we discuss various algorithmic aspects of adaptive synaptogenesis tailored to edge computing, demonstrate its function using simulations, and design nanomagnetic hardware accelerators for specific functions of synaptogenesis.

Title: Three-dimensional neural network driving self-interference digital holography enables high-fidelity, non-scanning volumetric fluorescence microscopy
Authors: Tianlong Man, Yuwen Zhang, Yuchen Wu, Zhiqing Zhang, Hongqiang Zhou, Liyun Zhong, Yuhong Wan
Abstract: We present a deep learning driven computational approach to overcome the limitations of self-interference digital holography that imposed by inferior axial imaging performances. We demonstrate a 3D deep neural network model can simultaneously suppresses the defocus noise and improves the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of conventional numerical back-propagation-obtained holographic reconstruction. Compared with existing 2D deep neural networks used for hologram reconstruction, our 3D model exhibits superior performance in enhancing the resolutions along all the three spatial dimensions. As the result, 3D non-scanning volumetric fluorescence microscopy can be achieved, using 2D self-interference hologram as input, without any mechanical and opto-electronic scanning and complicated system calibration. Our method offers a high spatiotemporal resolution 3D imaging approach which can potentially benefit, for example, the visualization of dynamics of cellular structure and measurement of 3D behavior of high-speed flow field.

Title: Deep Audio Watermarks are Shallow: Limitations of Post-Hoc Watermarking Techniques for Speech
Authors: Patrick O'Reilly, Zeyu Jin, Jiaqi Su, Bryan Pardo
Abstract: In the audio modality, state-of-the-art watermarking methods leverage deep neural networks to allow the embedding of human-imperceptible signatures in generated audio. The ideal is to embed signatures that can be detected with high accuracy when the watermarked audio is altered via compression, filtering, or other transformations. Existing audio watermarking techniques operate in a post-hoc manner, manipulating "low-level" features of audio recordings after generation (e.g. through the addition of a low-magnitude watermark signal). We show that this post-hoc formulation makes existing audio watermarks vulnerable to transformation-based removal attacks. Focusing on speech audio, we (1) unify and extend existing evaluations of the effect of audio transformations on watermark detectability, and (2) demonstrate that state-of-the-art post-hoc audio watermarks can be removed with no knowledge of the watermarking scheme and minimal degradation in audio quality.

Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30° angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.

Title: AdapCsiNet: Environment-Adaptive CSI Feedback via Scene Graph-Aided Deep Learning
Authors: Jiayi Liu, Jiajia Guo, Yiming Cui, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for realizing the full potential of multiple-antenna wireless communication systems. While deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback methods have shown promise in reducing feedback overhead, their generalization capability across varying propagation environments remains limited due to their data-driven nature. Existing solutions based on online training improve adaptability but impose significant overhead in terms of data collection and computational resources. In this work, we propose AdapCsiNet, an environment-adaptive DL-based CSI feedback framework that eliminates the need for online training. By integrating environmental information -- represented as a scene graph -- into a hypernetwork-guided CSI reconstruction process, AdapCsiNet dynamically adapts to diverse channel conditions. A two-step training strategy is introduced to ensure baseline reconstruction performance and effective environment-aware adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate that AdapCsiNet achieves up to 46.4% improvement in CSI reconstruction accuracy and matches the performance of online learning methods without incurring additional runtime overhead.

Title: Generalized Audio Deepfake Detection Using Frame-level Latent Information Entropy
Authors: Botao Zhao, Zuheng Kang, Yayun He, Xiaoyang Qu, Junqing Peng, Jing Xiao, Jianzong Wang
Abstract: Generalizability, the capacity of a robust model to perform effectively on unseen data, is crucial for audio deepfake detection due to the rapid evolution of text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) technologies. A promising approach to differentiate between bonafide and spoof samples lies in identifying intrinsic disparities to enhance model generalizability. From an information-theoretic perspective, we hypothesize the information content is one of the intrinsic differences: bonafide sample represents a dense, information-rich sampling of the real world, whereas spoof sample is typically derived from lower-dimensional, less informative representations. To implement this, we introduce frame-level latent information entropy detector(f-InfoED), a framework that extracts distinctive information entropy from latent representations at the frame level to identify audio deepfakes. Furthermore, we present AdaLAM, which extends large pre-trained audio models with trainable adapters for enhanced feature extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, the audio deepfake forensics 2024 (ADFF 2024) dataset was built by the latest TTS and VC methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities. Further analytical studies confirms the efficacy of AdaLAM in extracting discriminative audio features and f-InfoED in leveraging latent entropy information for more generalized deepfake detection.

Title: Progressive Rock Music Classification
Authors: Arpan Nagar, Joseph Bensabat, Jokent Gaza, Moinak Dey
Abstract: This study investigates the classification of progressive rock music, a genre characterized by complex compositions and diverse instrumentation, distinct from other musical styles. Addressing this Music Information Retrieval (MIR) task, we extracted comprehensive audio features, including spectrograms, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chromagrams, and beat positions from song snippets using the Librosa library. A winner-take-all voting strategy was employed to aggregate snippet-level predictions into final song classifications. We conducted a comparative analysis of various machine learning techniques. Ensemble methods, encompassing Bagging (Random Forest, ExtraTrees, Bagging Classifier) and Boosting (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting), were explored, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to manage computational constraints with high-dimensional feature sets. Additionally, deep learning approaches were investigated, including the development of custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) architectures (named "Zuck" and "Satya") featuring specific layer configurations, normalization, and activation functions. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a state-of-the-art Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, leveraging its attention-based mechanisms for audio classification. Performance evaluation on validation and test sets revealed varying effectiveness across models, with ensemble methods like Extra Trees achieving test accuracies up to 76.38%. This research provides insights into the application and relative performance of diverse machine learning paradigms for the nuanced task of progressive rock genre classification.

Title: Radiation Footprint Control in Cell-Free Cooperative ISAC: Optimal Joint BS Activation and Beamforming Coordination
Authors: Jie Chen, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: Coordinated beamforming across distributed base stations (BSs) in cell-free architectures can efficiently support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) users by improving resource sharing and reducing conflicts in the spatial domain. However, coordinating numerous BSs within the ISAC network poses risks of generating substantial interference for other networks sharing the spectrum, while also increasing operational costs from power consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interference-suppressed and cost-optimized cell-free ISAC network by opportunistically and cooperatively orchestrating distributed radio resources to address competing sensing and communication (S\&C) demands. Specifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other networks without exchanging signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this framework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that considers individual S\&C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint constraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we develop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative method to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: A comprehensive review of remote sensing in wetland classification and mapping
Authors: Shuai Yuan, Xiangan Liang, Tianwu Lin, Shuang Chen, Rui Liu, Jie Wang, Hongsheng Zhang, Peng Gong
Abstract: Wetlands constitute critical ecosystems that support both biodiversity and human well-being; however, they have experienced a significant decline since the 20th century. Back in the 1970s, researchers began to employ remote sensing technologies for wetland classification and mapping to elucidate the extent and variations of wetlands. Although some review articles summarized the development of this field, there is a lack of a thorough and in-depth understanding of wetland classification and mapping: (1) the scientific importance of wetlands, (2) major data, methods used in wetland classification and mapping, (3) driving factors of wetland changes, (4) current research paradigm and limitations, (5) challenges and opportunities in wetland classification and mapping under the context of technological innovation and global environmental change. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective and new insights into wetland classification and mapping for readers to answer these questions. First, we conduct a meta-analysis of over 1,200 papers, encompassing wetland types, methods, sensor types, and study sites, examining prevailing trends in wetland classification and mapping. Next, we review and synthesize the wetland features and existing data and methods in wetland classification and mapping. We also summarize typical wetland mapping products and explore the intrinsic driving factors of wetland changes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we discuss current limitations and propose future directions in response to global environmental change and technological innovation. This review consolidates our understanding of wetland remote sensing and offers scientific recommendations that foster transformative progress in wetland science.

Title: Fast-Powerformer: A Memory-Efficient Transformer for Accurate Mid-Term Wind Power Forecasting
Authors: Mingyi Zhu, Zhaoxin Li, Qiao Lin, Li Ding
Abstract: Wind power forecasting (WPF), as a significant research topic within renewable energy, plays a crucial role in enhancing the security, stability, and economic operation of power grids. However, due to the high stochasticity of meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed) and significant fluctuations in wind power output, mid-term wind power forecasting faces a dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight mid-term wind power forecasting model, termed Fast-Powerformer. The proposed model is built upon the Reformer architecture, incorporating structural enhancements such as a lightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) embedding module, an input transposition mechanism, and a Frequency Enhanced Channel Attention Mechanism (FECAM). These improvements enable the model to strengthen temporal feature extraction, optimize dependency modeling across variables, significantly reduce computational complexity, and enhance sensitivity to periodic patterns and dominant frequency components. Experimental results conducted on multiple real-world wind farm datasets demonstrate that the proposed Fast-Powerformer achieves superior prediction accuracy and operational efficiency compared to mainstream forecasting approaches. Furthermore, the model exhibits fast inference speed and low memory consumption, highlighting its considerable practical value for real-world deployment scenarios.

Title: A Primer on Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM)
Authors: Hai Lin
Abstract: As a new type of multicarrier (MC) scheme built upon the recently discovered delay-Doppler domain orthogonal pulse (DDOP), orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) aims to address the challenges of waveform design in linear time-varying channels. In this paper, we explore the design principles of ODDM and clarify the key ideas underlying the DDOP. We then derive an alternative representation of the DDOP and highlight the fundamental differences between ODDM and conventional MC schemes. Finally, we discuss and compare two implementation methods for ODDM.

Title: $π$-MPPI: A Projection-based Model Predictive Path Integral Scheme for Smooth Optimal Control of Fixed-Wing Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Edvin Martin Andrejev, Amith Manoharan, Karl-Eerik Unt, Arun Kumar Singh
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) is a popular sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for nonlinear systems. It optimizes trajectories by sampling control sequences and averaging them. However, a key issue with MPPI is the non-smoothness of the optimal control sequence, leading to oscillations in systems like fixed-wing aerial vehicles (FWVs). Existing solutions use post-hoc smoothing, which fails to bound control derivatives. This paper introduces a new approach: we add a projection filter $\pi$ to minimally correct control samples, ensuring bounds on control magnitude and higher-order derivatives. The filtered samples are then averaged using MPPI, leading to our $\pi$-MPPI approach. We minimize computational overhead by using a neural accelerated custom optimizer for the projection filter. $\pi$-MPPI offers a simple way to achieve arbitrary smoothness in control sequences. While we focus on FWVs, this projection filter can be integrated into any MPPI pipeline. Applied to FWVs, $\pi$-MPPI is easier to tune than the baseline, resulting in smoother, more robust performance.

Title: Self-Supervised Enhancement of Forward-Looking Sonar Images: Bridging Cross-Modal Degradation Gaps through Feature Space Transformation and Multi-Frame Fusion
Authors: Zhisheng Zhang, Peng Zhang, Fengxiang Wang, Liangli Ma, Fuchun Sun
Abstract: Enhancing forward-looking sonar images is critical for accurate underwater target detection. Current deep learning methods mainly rely on supervised training with simulated data, but the difficulty in obtaining high-quality real-world paired data limits their practical use and generalization. Although self-supervised approaches from remote sensing partially alleviate data shortages, they neglect the cross-modal degradation gap between sonar and remote sensing images. Directly transferring pretrained weights often leads to overly smooth sonar images, detail loss, and insufficient brightness. To address this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images from the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the degradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy leverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle noise and enhance target-region brightness. Experiments on three self-collected real-world forward-looking sonar datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively suppressing noise, preserving detailed edges, and substantially improving brightness, demonstrating strong potential for underwater target detection applications.

Title: Dopamine Audiobook: A Training-free MLLM Agent for Emotional and Human-like Audiobook Generation
Authors: Yan Rong, Shan Yang, Guangzhi Lei, Li Liu
Abstract: Audiobook generation, which creates vivid and emotion-rich audio works, faces challenges in conveying complex emotions, achieving human-like qualities, and aligning evaluations with human preferences. Existing text-to-speech (TTS) methods are often limited to specific scenarios, struggle with emotional transitions, and lack automatic human-aligned evaluation benchmarks, instead relying on either misaligned automated metrics or costly human assessments. To address these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a new unified training-free system leveraging a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as an AI agent for emotional and human-like audiobook generation and evaluation. Specifically, we first design a flow-based emotion-enhanced framework that decomposes complex emotional speech synthesis into controllable sub-tasks. Then, we propose an adaptive model selection module that dynamically selects the most suitable TTS methods from a set of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTS methods for diverse scenarios. We further enhance emotional expressiveness through paralinguistic augmentation and prosody retrieval at word and utterance levels. For evaluation, we propose a novel GPT-based evaluation framework incorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo prompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experiments show that our method generates long speech with superior emotional expression to SOTA TTS models in various metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework demonstrates better alignment with human preferences and transferability across audio tasks. Project website with audio samples can be found at this https URL.

Title: Neural Control Barrier Functions from Physics Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Shreenabh Agrawal, Manan Tayal, Aditya Singh, Shishir Kolathaya
Abstract: As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in daily life, ensuring their safety is paramount. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective tool for guaranteeing safety; however, manually designing them for specific applications remains a significant challenge. With the advent of deep learning techniques, recent research has explored synthesizing CBFs using neural networks-commonly referred to as neural CBFs. This paper introduces a novel class of neural CBFs that leverages a physics-inspired neural network framework by incorporating Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE) within the context of safety. This approach provides a scalable methodology for synthesizing neural CBFs applicable to high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, by utilizing reciprocal CBFs instead of zeroing CBFs, the proposed framework allows for the specification of flexible, user-defined safe regions. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, we present case studies on three different systems: an inverted pendulum, autonomous ground navigation, and aerial navigation in obstacle-laden environments.

Title: A Multi-UAV Formation Obstacle Avoidance Method Combined Improved Simulated Annealing and Adaptive Artificial Potential Field
Authors: Bo Ma, Yi Ji, Liyong Fang
Abstract: The traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method exhibits limitations in its force distribution: excessive attraction when UAVs are far from the target may cause collisions with obstacles, while insufficient attraction near the goal often results in failure to reach the target. Furthermore, APF is highly susceptible to local minima, compromising motion reliability in complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hybrid obstacle avoidance algorithm-Deflected Simulated Annealing-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field (DSA-AAPF)-which combines an improved simulated annealing mechanism with an enhanced APF model. The proposed approach integrates a Leader-Follower distributed formation strategy with the APF framework, where the resultant force formulation is redefined to smooth UAV trajectories. An adaptive gravitational gain function is introduced to dynamically adjust UAV velocity based on environmental context, and a fast-converging controller ensures accurate and efficient convergence to the target. Moreover, a directional deflection mechanism is embedded within the simulated annealing process, enabling UAVs to escape local minima caused by semi-enclosed obstacles through continuous rotational motion. The simulation results, covering formation reconfiguration, complex obstacle avoidance, and entrapment escape, demonstrate the feasibility, robustness, and superiority of the proposed DSA-AAPF algorithm.

Title: A Unified Hardware Accelerator for Fast Fourier Transform and Number Theoretic Transform
Authors: Rishabh Shrivastava, Chaitanya Prasad Ratnala, Durga Manasa Puli, Utsav Banerjee
Abstract: The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is an indispensable tool for computing efficient polynomial multiplications in post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. It has strong resemblance with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is the most widely used algorithm in digital signal processing. In this work, we demonstrate a unified hardware accelerator supporting both 512-point complex FFT as well as 256-point NTT for the recently standardized NIST post-quantum key encapsulation and digital signature algorithms ML-KEM and ML-DSA respectively. Our proposed architecture effectively utilizes the arithmetic circuitry required for complex FFT, and the only additional circuits required are for modular reduction along with modifications in the control logic. Our implementation achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art ML-KEM / ML-DSA NTT accelerators on FPGA, thus demonstrating how an FFT accelerator can be augmented to support NTT and the unified hardware can be used for both digital signal processing and post-quantum lattice-based cryptography applications.

Title: K-means Enhanced Density Gradient Analysis for Urban and Transport Metrics Using Multi-Modal Satellite Imagery
Authors: P. Tomkiewicz, J. Jaworski, P. Zielonka, A. Wilinski
Abstract: This paper presents a novel computational approach for evaluating urban metrics through density gradient analysis using multi-modal satellite imagery, with applications including public transport and other urban systems. By combining optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, we develop a method to segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify density gradients. Our approach calculates two key metrics: the density gradient coefficient ($\alpha$) and the minimum effective distance (LD) at which density reaches a target threshold. We further employ machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to objectively identify uniform and high-variability regions within density gradient plots. We demonstrate that these metrics provide an effective screening tool for public transport analyses by revealing the underlying urban structure. Through comparative analysis of two representative cities with contrasting urban morphologies (monocentric vs polycentric), we establish relationships between density gradient characteristics and public transport network topologies. Cities with clear density peaks in their gradient plots indicate distinct urban centers requiring different transport strategies than those with more uniform density distributions. This methodology offers urban planners a cost-effective, globally applicable approach to preliminary public transport assessment using freely available satellite data. The complete implementation, with additional examples and documentation, is available in an open-source repository under the MIT license at this https URL.

Title: SAR-to-RGB Translation with Latent Diffusion for Earth Observation
Authors: Kaan Aydin, Joelle Hanna, Damian Borth
Abstract: Earth observation satellites like Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) provide complementary remote sensing (RS) data, but S2 images are often unavailable due to cloud cover or data gaps. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)-based approach for SAR-to-RGB translation, generating synthetic optical images from SAR inputs. We explore three different setups: two using Standard Diffusion, which reconstruct S2 images by adding and removing noise (one without and one with class conditioning), and one using Cold Diffusion, which blends S2 with S1 before removing the SAR signal. We evaluate the generated images in downstream tasks, including land cover classification and cloud removal. While generated images may not perfectly replicate real S2 data, they still provide valuable information. Our results show that class conditioning improves classification accuracy, while cloud removal performance remains competitive despite our approach not being optimized for it. Interestingly, despite exhibiting lower perceptual quality, the Cold Diffusion setup performs well in land cover classification, suggesting that traditional quantitative evaluation metrics may not fully reflect the practical utility of generated images. Our findings highlight the potential of DMs for SAR-to-RGB translation in RS applications where RGB images are missing.

Title: Focal Split: Untethered Snapshot Depth from Differential Defocus
Authors: Junjie Luo, John Mamish, Alan Fu, Thomas Concannon, Josiah Hester, Emma Alexander, Qi Guo
Abstract: We introduce Focal Split, a handheld, snapshot depth camera with fully onboard power and computing based on depth-from-differential-defocus (DfDD). Focal Split is passive, avoiding power consumption of light sources. Its achromatic optical system simultaneously forms two differentially defocused images of the scene, which can be independently captured using two photosensors in a snapshot. The data processing is based on the DfDD theory, which efficiently computes a depth and a confidence value for each pixel with only 500 floating point operations (FLOPs) per pixel from the camera measurements. We demonstrate a Focal Split prototype, which comprises a handheld custom camera system connected to a Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time data processing. The system consumes 4.9 W and is powered on a 5 V, 10,000 mAh battery. The prototype can measure objects with distances from 0.4 m to 1.2 m, outputting 480$\times$360 sparse depth maps at 2.1 frames per second (FPS) using unoptimized Python scripts. Focal Split is DIY friendly. A comprehensive guide to building your own Focal Split depth camera, code, and additional data can be found at this https URL.

Title: A Review of Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit vs. Jam-Absorption Driving
Authors: Zhengbing He, Jorge Laval, Yu Han, Ryosuke Nishi, Cathy Wu
Abstract: The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave, characterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided enough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the two areas and identifying research opportunities from the following perspectives: fundamental diagrams, traffic dynamics modeling, traffic state estimation and prediction, stochasticity, scenarios for strategy validation, and field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review, one area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging the strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway stop-and-go wave suppression.

Title: Breaking the TDD Flow for Over-the-Air Phase Synchronization in Distributed Antenna Systems
Authors: Khac-Hoang Ngo, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: Phase synchronization between distributed antenna arrays requires measurements that break the standard time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We present a feasibility study on implementing such synchronization and analyze its impact on the quality of service. Considering two antenna arrays with independent local oscillators (LOs), we propose a modified TDD flow to accommodate the transmission of phase synchronization signals, formulate the phase estimation and compensation problem, and derive the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that frequent re-estimation of the interarray phase disparity is essential for maximizing SE in systems with low-quality LOs. Furthermore, applying a Kalman filter for phase tracking substantially improves the SE, especially if phase estimation errors are large compared to LOs phase drifts.

Title: Deep Learning-based Bathymetry Retrieval without In-situ Depths using Remote Sensing Imagery and SfM-MVS DSMs with Data Gaps
Authors: Panagiotis Agrafiotis, Begüm Demir
Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and high-frequent bathymetry is crucial for shallow seabed areas facing intense climatological and anthropogenic pressures. Current methods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry primarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally Derived Bathymetry (SDB). However, SDB methods often require extensive manual fieldwork or costly reference data, while SfM-MVS approaches face challenges even after refraction correction. These include depth data gaps and noise in environments with homogeneous visual textures, which hinder the creation of accurate and complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed. To address these challenges, this work introduces a methodology that combines the high-fidelity 3D reconstruction capabilities of the SfM-MVS methods with state-of-the-art refraction correction techniques, along with the spectral analysis capabilities of a new deep learning-based method for bathymetry prediction. This integration enables a synergistic approach where SfM-MVS derived DSMs with data gaps are used as training data to generate complete bathymetric maps. In this context, we propose Swin-BathyUNet that combines U-Net with Swin Transformer self-attention layers and a cross-attention mechanism, specifically tailored for SDB. Swin-BathyUNet is designed to improve bathymetric accuracy by capturing long-range spatial relationships and can also function as a standalone solution for standard SDB with various training depth data, independent of the SfM-MVS output. Experimental results in two completely different test sites in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments that demonstrate improvements in bathymetric accuracy, detail, coverage, and noise reduction in the predicted DSM. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: HeatSense: Intelligent Thermal Anomaly Detection for Securing NoC-Enabled MPSoCs
Authors: Mahdi Hasanzadeh, Kasem Khalil, Cynthia Sturton, Ahmad Patooghy
Abstract: Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) are highly vulnerable to thermal attacks that manipulate dynamic thermal management systems. To counter this, we propose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal thermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify key thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be implemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware overhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift operations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a spectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates malicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00°C to 1.9°C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in detecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing machine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces hardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized resources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This method provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained environments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining system performance.

Title: Ring deconvolution microscopy: exploiting symmetry for efficient spatially varying aberration correction
Authors: Amit Kohli, Anastasios N. Angelopoulos, David McAllister, Esther Whang, Sixian You, Kyrollos Yanny, Federico M. Gasparoli, Bo-Jui Chang, Reto Fiolka, Laura Waller
Abstract: The most ubiquitous form of computational aberration correction for microscopy is deconvolution. However, deconvolution relies on the assumption that the point spread function is the same across the entire field-of-view. This assumption is often inadequate, but space-variant deblurring techniques generally require impractical amounts of calibration and computation. We present a new imaging pipeline that leverages symmetry to provide simple and fast spatially-varying aberration correction. Our ring deconvolution microscopy (RDM) method leverages the rotational symmetry of most microscopes and cameras, and naturally extends to sheet deconvolution in the case of lateral symmetry. We formally derive theory and algorithms for image recovery and additionally propose a neural network based on Seidel coefficients as a fast alternative, as well as extension of RDM to blind deconvolution. We demonstrate significant improvements in speed and image quality as compared to standard deconvolution and existing spatially-varying deconvolution across a diverse range of microscope modalities, including miniature microscopy, multicolor fluorescence microscopy, point-scanning multimode fiber micro-endoscopy, and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. Our approach enables near-isotropic, subcellular resolution in each of these applications.

Title: Point Processes and spatial statistics in time-frequency analysis
Authors: Barbara Pascal, Rémi Bardenet
Abstract: A finite-energy signal is represented by a square-integrable, complex-valued function $t\mapsto s(t)$ of a real variable $t$, interpreted as time. Similarly, a noisy signal is represented by a random process. Time-frequency analysis, a subfield of signal processing, amounts to describing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of a signal. Loosely speaking, if $s$ is the audio recording of a musical piece, time-frequency analysis somehow consists in writing the musical score of the piece. Mathematically, the operation is performed through a transform $\mathcal{V}$, mapping $s \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ onto a complex-valued function $\mathcal{V}s \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of time $t$ and angular frequency $\omega$. The squared modulus $(t, \omega) \mapsto \vert\mathcal{V}s(t,\omega)\vert^2$ of the time-frequency representation is known as the spectrogram of $s$; in the musical score analogy, a peaked spectrogram at $(t_0,\omega_0)$ corresponds to a musical note at angular frequency $\omega_0$ localized at time $t_0$. More generally, the intuition is that upper level sets of the spectrogram contain relevant information about in the original signal. Hence, many signal processing algorithms revolve around identifying maxima of the spectrogram. In contrast, zeros of the spectrogram indicate perfect silence, that is, a time at which a particular frequency is absent. Assimilating $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{C}$ through $z = \omega + \mathrm{i}t$, this chapter focuses on time-frequency transforms $\mathcal{V}$ that map signals to analytic functions. The zeros of the spectrogram of a noisy signal are then the zeros of a random analytic function, hence forming a Point Process in $\mathbb{C}$. This chapter is devoted to the study of these Point Processes, to their links with zeros of Gaussian Analytic Functions, and to designing signal detection and denoising algorithms using spatial statistics.

Title: Kernel Modelling of Fading Memory Systems
Authors: Yongkang Huo, Thomas Chaffey, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.

Title: Steering Feedback in Dynamic Driving Simulators: The Influence of Steering Wheel Vibration and Vehicle Motion Frequency
Authors: Maximilian Böhle, Bernhard Schick, Steffen Müller
Abstract: The validity of the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in driving simulators is crucial for modern vehicle development. Although there are established objective steering characteristics for the assessment of both stationary and dynamic feedback behaviour, factors such as steering wheel vibrations and vehicle body motion, particularly in high-frequency ranges, present challenges in simulator fidelity. This work investigates the influence of steering wheel vibration and vehicle body motion frequency content on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback during closed-loop driving in a dynamic driving simulator. A controlled subject study with 30 participants consisting of a back-to-back comparison of a reference vehicle with an electrical power steering system and three variants of its virtual representation on a dynamic driving simulator was performed. Subjective evaluation focused on the representation of road feedback in comparison to the reference vehicle. The statistical analysis of subjective results show that there is a significant influence of the frequency content of both steering wheel torque and vehicle motion on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in a dynamic driving simulator. The results suggest an influence of frequency content on the subjective evaluation quality of steering feedback characteristics that are not associated with the dynamic feedback behaviour in the context of established performance indicators.

Title: Balancing Forecast Accuracy and Switching Costs in Online Optimization of Energy Management Systems
Authors: Evgenii Genov, Julian Ruddick, Christoph Bergmeir, Majid Vafaeipour, Thierry Coosemans, Salvador Garcia, Maarten Messagie
Abstract: This study investigates the integration of forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, with a focus on the role of switching costs -- penalties incurred from frequent operational adjustments. We develop a theoretical and empirical framework to examine how forecast accuracy and stability interact with switching costs in online decision-making settings. Our analysis spans both deterministic and stochastic optimization approaches, using point and probabilistic forecasts. A novel metric for measuring temporal consistency in probabilistic forecasts is introduced, and the framework is validated in a real-world battery scheduling case based on the CityLearn 2022 challenge. Results show that switching costs significantly alter the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, and that more stable forecasts can reduce the performance loss due to switching. Contrary to common practice, the findings suggest that, under non-negligible switching costs, longer commitment periods may lead to better overall outcomes. These insights have practical implications for the design of intelligent, forecast-aware energy management systems.

Title: The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros
Authors: Ali Moukadem, Barbara Pascal, Jean-Baptiste Courbot, Nicolas Juillet
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincaré disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.

Title: Over-the-Air Diagnosis of Defective Elements in Intelligent Reflecting Surface
Authors: Ziyi Zhao, Zhaorui Wang, Lin Zhou, Chunsong Sun, Shuowen Zhang, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Liang Liu
Abstract: Due to circuit failures, defective elements that cannot adaptively adjust the phase shifts of their impinging signals in a desired manner may exist on an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Traditional way to locate these defective IRS elements requires a thorough diagnosis of all the circuits belonging to a huge number of IRS elements, which is practically challenging. In this paper, we will devise novel approaches under which a transmitter sends known pilot signals and a receiver localizes all the defective IRS elements just based on its over-the-air measurements reflected from the IRS. Specifically, given any set of IRS elements, we propose an efficient method to process the received signals to determine whether this cluster contains defective elements or not with a very high accuracy probability. Based on this method, we show that the over-the-air diagnosis problem belongs to the 20 questions problem, where we can adaptively change the query set at the IRS so as to localize all the defective elements as quickly as possible. Along this line, we first propose a sorted posterior matching (sortPM) based method according to the noisy 20 questions technique, which enables accurate diagnosis even if the answers about the existence of defective elements in some sets of interest are wrong at certain question and answer (Q&A) rounds due to the noisy received signals. Next, to reduce the complexity, we propose a bisection based method according to the noiseless 20 questions technique, which totally trusts the answer at each Q&A round and keeps removing half of the remaining region based on such answers. Via numerical results, we show that our proposed methods can exploit the over-the-air measurements to localize all the defective IRS elements quickly and accurately.

Title: Code Drift: Towards Idempotent Neural Audio Codecs
Authors: Patrick O'Reilly, Prem Seetharaman, Jiaqi Su, Zeyu Jin, Bryan Pardo
Abstract: Neural codecs have demonstrated strong performance in high-fidelity compression of audio signals at low bitrates. The token-based representations produced by these codecs have proven particularly useful for generative modeling. While much research has focused on improvements in compression ratio and perceptual transparency, recent works have largely overlooked another desirable codec property -- idempotence, the stability of compressed outputs under multiple rounds of encoding. We find that state-of-the-art neural codecs exhibit varied degrees of idempotence, with some degrading audio outputs significantly after as few as three encodings. We investigate possible causes of low idempotence and devise a method for improving idempotence through fine-tuning a codec model. We then examine the effect of idempotence on a simple conditional generative modeling task, and find that increased idempotence can be achieved without negatively impacting downstream modeling performance -- potentially extending the usefulness of neural codecs for practical file compression and iterative generative modeling workflows.

Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) is a promising technology anticipated to play a key role in the next-generation network of networks, especially as a complementary technology to traditional radio frequency communications, for enhancing networking capabilities beyond conventional terrestrial networks. OWC is already a mature technology with diverse usage scenarios, and can enable integrated applications via wireless access and backhaul networks, dynamic drone and satellite networks, underwater networks, inter- and intra-system interconnecting networks, and vehicular communication networks. Furthermore, novel and emerging technological opportunities such as photovoltaic cells, orbital angular momentum-based modulation, optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, organic light-emitting and photo diodes, and recent advances in ultraviolet communications can help enhance future OWC capabilities even further. Moreover, OWC networks can also support value-added services such as enhanced positioning and gesture recognition. Hence, OWC provides unique functionalities that can play a crucial role in building convergent and resilient future network of networks alongside radio frequency and optical fiber technologies.

Title: Predictive Target-to-User Association in Complex Scenarios via Hybrid-Field ISAC Signaling
Authors: Yifeng Yuan, Miaowen Wen, Xinhu Zheng, Shuoyao Wang, Shijian Gao
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and robust target-to-user (T2U) association framework to support reliable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks that potentially operate within the hybrid field (near-field and far-field). To address the challenges posed by complex vehicle maneuvers and user association ambiguity, an interacting multiple-model filtering scheme is developed, which combines coordinated turn and constant velocity models for predictive beamforming. Building upon this foundation, a lightweight association scheme leverages user-specific integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signaling while employing probabilistic data association to manage clutter measurements in dense traffic. Numerical results validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of both tracking accuracy and association reliability.

Title: RACNN: Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Near-Field Channel Estimation in 6G Wireless Communications
Authors: Vu Tung Lam, Do Hai Son, Tran Thi Thuy Quynh, Le Trung Thanh
Abstract: Near-field channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, where extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) enable near-field communication (NFC) but introduce significant signal processing complexity. Traditional model-based methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability in large-scale ELAA systems, while existing learning-based approaches often lack robustness across diverse channel conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN), which integrates convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction by focusing on key regions within the CNN feature maps. Experimental results show that RACNN outperforms both traditional and learning-based methods, including XLCNet, across various scenarios, particularly in mixed far-field and near-field conditions. Notably, in these challenging settings, RACNN achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 4.8*10^(-3) at an SNR of 20dB, making it a promising solution for near-field channel estimation in 6G.

Title: FNSE-SBGAN: Far-field Speech Enhancement with Schrodinger Bridge and Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Tong Lei, Qinwen Hu, Ziyao Lin, Andong Li, Rilin Chen, Meng Yu, Dong Yu, Jing Lu
Abstract: The prevailing method for neural speech enhancement predominantly utilizes fully-supervised deep learning with simulated pairs of far-field noisy-reverberant speech and clean speech. Nonetheless, these models frequently demonstrate restricted generalizability to mixtures recorded in real-world conditions. To address this issue, this study investigates training enhancement models directly on real mixtures. Specifically, we revisit the single-channel far-field to near-field speech enhancement (FNSE) task, focusing on real-world data characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high reverberation, and mid-to-high frequency attenuation. We propose FNSE-SBGAN, a framework that integrates a Schrodinger Bridge (SB)-based diffusion model with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and subjective evaluations, significantly reducing the character error rate (CER) by up to 14.58% compared to far-field signals. Experimental results demonstrate that FNSE-SBGAN preserves superior subjective quality and establishes a new benchmark for real-world far-field speech enhancement. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework leveraging matrix rank analysis in the time-frequency domain, providing systematic insights into model performance and revealing the strengths and weaknesses of different generative methods.

Title: A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior
Authors: Yibo Shi, Braghadeesh Lakshminarayanan, Cristian R. Rojas
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistics, system identification and machine learning. For most inference problems, prior knowledge is available on the system to be modeled, and Bayesian analysis is a natural framework to impose such prior information in the form of a prior distribution. However, in many situations, coming out with a fully specified prior distribution is not easy, as prior knowledge might be too vague, so practitioners prefer to use a prior distribution that is as `ignorant' or `uninformative' as possible, in the sense of not imposing subjective beliefs, while still supporting reliable statistical analysis. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because it offers two important benefits: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior, and provide numerical illustrations of our approach through several examples.

Title: SlicerNNInteractive: A 3D Slicer extension for nnInteractive
Authors: Coen de Vente, Kiran Vaidhya Venkadesh, Bram van Ginneken, Clara I. Sánchez
Abstract: SlicerNNInteractive integrates nnInteractive, a state-of-the-art promptable deep learning-based framework for 3D image segmentation, into the widely used 3D Slicer platform. Our extension implements a client-server architecture that decouples computationally intensive model inference from the client-side interface. Therefore, SlicerNNInteractive eliminates heavy hardware constraints on the client-side and enables better operating system compatibility than existing plugins for nnInteractive. Running both the client and server-side on a single machine is also possible, offering flexibility across different deployment scenarios. The extension provides an intuitive user interface with all interaction types available in the original framework (point, bounding box, scribble, and lasso prompts), while including a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow.

Title: Flip-KLJN: Random Resistance Flipping for Noise-Driven Secure Communication
Authors: Recep Akif Tasci, Ibrahim Yildirim, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: The information-theoretically (unconditionally) secure Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) bit exchange protocol uses two identical resistor pairs with high (H) and low (L) resistance values, driven by Gaussian noise generators emulating Johnson noise with a high common temperature. The resulting mean-square noise voltage on the wire connecting Alice and Bob has three levels: low (L/L), intermediate (H/L or L/H), and high (H/H), and secure key sharing is achieved at the intermediate level (L/H or H/L). This paper introduces the Flip-KLJN scheme, where a pre-agreed intermediate level, such as H/L, triggers a flip of the bit map value during the bit exchange period. For Eve, the bit map flips appear random. Thus, the formerly discarded H/H and L/L situations can also have a pre-agreed bit value mapping, which flips together with the original bit mapping. Thus, Flip-KLJN doubles the key rate and ensures that all three levels on the wire are indistinguishable for Eve. Bit error probabilities are addressed through analytic calculations and computer simulations.

Title: Diversity Analysis for Indoor Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading
Authors: Almutasem Bellah Enad, Jihad Fahs, Hakim Jemaa, Hadi Sarieddeen, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Harnessing diversity is fundamental to wireless communication systems, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, where severe path loss and small-scale fading pose significant challenges to system reliability and performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive diversity analysis for indoor THz communication systems, accounting for the combined effects of path loss and small-scale fading, with the latter modeled as an $\alpha-\mu$ distribution to reflect THz indoor channel conditions. We derive closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as a function of the reciprocal of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an asymptotic expression. Furthermore, we validate these expressions through extensive simulations, which show strong agreement with the theoretical analysis, confirming the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods. Our results show that the diversity order in THz systems is primarily determined by the combined effects of the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and the degree of channel frequency selectivity, providing clear insights into how diversity gains can be optimized in high-frequency wireless networks.

Title: A moving horizon estimator for aquifer thermal energy storages
Authors: Johannes van Randenborgh, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) represent groundwater saturated aquifers that store thermal energy in the form of heated or cooled groundwater. Combining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat) and winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES throughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC technology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control (MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach for ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial temperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater temperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation of the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the borehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based observers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since the model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of the hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator based on a quadratic program.

Title: Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Secure Wireless Communication
Authors: Liang Dai, Beixiong Zheng, Qingjie Wu
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves significant improvement in achievable secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Title: Deep-seeded Clustering for Emotion Recognition from Wearable Physiological Sensors
Authors: Marta A. Conceição, Antoine Dubois, Sonja Haustein, Bruno Miranda, Carlos Lima Azevedo
Abstract: According to the circumplex model of affect, an emotional response could characterized by a level of pleasure (valence) and intensity (arousal). As it reflects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, modern wearable wristbands can record non-invasively and during our everyday lives peripheral end-points of this response. While emotion recognition from physiological signals is usually achieved using supervised machine learning algorithms that require ground truth labels for training, collecting it is cumbersome and particularly unfeasible in naturalistic settings, and extracting meaningful insights from these signals requires domain knowledge and might be prone to bias. Here, we propose and test a deep-seeded clustering algorithm that automatically extracts and classifies features from those physiological signals with minimal supervision - combining an autoencoder (AE) for unsupervised feature representation and c-means clustering for fine-grained classification. We also show that the model obtains good performance results across three different datasets frequently used in affective computing studies (accuracies of 80.7% on WESAD, 64.2% on Stress-Predict and 61.0% on CEAP360-VR).

Title: Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Driving: Challenges, Possible Solutions and Opportunities
Authors: Senkang Hu, Zhengru Fang, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang
Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and industries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving system. However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

Title: Optimal Intraday Power Trading for Single-Price Balancing Markets: An Adaptive Risk-Averse Strategy using Mixture Models
Authors: Robin Bruneel, Mathijs Schuurmans, Panagiotis Patrinos
Abstract: Efficient markets are characterised by profit-driven participants continuously refining their positions towards the latest insights. Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.

Title: A Hierarchical Dataflow-Driven Heterogeneous Architecture for Wireless Baseband Processing
Authors: Limin Jiang, Yi Shi, Yintao Liu, Qingyu Deng, Siyi Xu, Yihao Shen, Fangfang Ye, Shan Cao, Zhiyuan Jiang
Abstract: Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\times$ and $2.3\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.

Title: SpoofCeleb: Speech Deepfake Detection and SASV In The Wild
Authors: Jee-weon Jung, Yihan Wu, Xin Wang, Ji-Hoon Kim, Soumi Maiti, Yuta Matsunaga, Hye-jin Shim, Jinchuan Tian, Nicholas Evans, Joon Son Chung, Wangyou Zhang, Seyun Um, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: This paper introduces SpoofCeleb, a dataset designed for Speech Deepfake Detection (SDD) and Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV), utilizing source data from real-world conditions and spoofing attacks generated by Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems also trained on the same real-world data. Robust recognition systems require speech data recorded in varied acoustic environments with different levels of noise to be trained. However, current datasets typically include clean, high-quality recordings (bona fide data) due to the requirements for TTS training; studio-quality or well-recorded read speech is typically necessary to train TTS models. Current SDD datasets also have limited usefulness for training SASV models due to insufficient speaker diversity. SpoofCeleb leverages a fully automated pipeline we developed that processes the VoxCeleb1 dataset, transforming it into a suitable form for TTS training. We subsequently train 23 contemporary TTS systems. SpoofCeleb comprises over 2.5 million utterances from 1,251 unique speakers, collected under natural, real-world conditions. The dataset includes carefully partitioned training, validation, and evaluation sets with well-controlled experimental protocols. We present the baseline results for both SDD and SASV tasks. All data, protocols, and baselines are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills using Large Language Models
Authors: Kanghyun Ryu, Qiayuan Liao, Zhongyu Li, Payam Delgosha, Koushil Sreenath, Negar Mehr
Abstract: Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world. Project website is this https URL

Title: Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology
Authors: Timo Jakumeit, Lukas Brand, Jens Kirchner, Robert Schober, Sebastian Lotter
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.

Title: Large problems are not necessarily hard: A case study on distributed NMPC paying off
Authors: Gösta Stomberg, Maurice Raetsch, Alexander Engelmann, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: A key motivation in the development of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) is to accelerate centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) for large-scale systems. DMPC has the prospect of scaling well by parallelizing computations among subsystems. However, communication delays may deteriorate the performance of decentralized optimization, if excessively many iterations are required per control step. Moreover, centralized solvers often exhibit faster asymptotic convergence rates and, by parallelizing costly linear algebra operations, they can also benefit from modern multicore computing architectures. On this canvas, we study the computational performance of cooperative DMPC for linear and nonlinear systems. To this end, we apply a tailored decentralized real-time iteration scheme to frequency control for power systems. DMPC scales well for the considered linear and nonlinear benchmarks, as the iteration number does not depend on the number of subsystems. Comparisons with multi-threaded centralized solvers demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed decentralized optimization algorithms.

Occhipinti
Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse monitoring and assistance needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p<0.01) compared to traditional home environment. Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable framework for patient-centered, long-term care in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.

Title: Fine-tuning Whisper on Low-Resource Languages for Real-World Applications
Authors: Vincenzo Timmel, Claudio Paonessa, Reza Kakooee, Manfred Vogel, Daniel Perruchoud
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for low-resource languages by introducing a novel data generation method that converts sentence-level data into a long-form corpus, using Swiss German as a case study. Non-sentence-level data, which could improve the performance of long-form audio, is difficult to obtain and often restricted by copyright laws. Our method bridges this gap by transforming more accessible sentence-level data into a format that preserves the model's ability to handle long-form audio and perform segmentation without requiring non-sentence-level data. Our data generation process improves performance in several real-world applications and leads to the development of a new state-of-the-art speech-to-text (STT) model for Swiss German. We compare our model with a non-fine-tuned Whisper and our previous state-of-the-art Swiss German STT models, where our new model achieves higher BLEU scores. Our results also indicate that the proposed method is adaptable to other low-resource languages, supported by written guidance and code that allows the creation of fine-tuned Whisper models, which keep segmentation capabilities and allow the transcription of longer audio files using only sentence-level data with high quality.

Title: SHIELD: Secure Host-Independent Extensible Logging for Tamper-Proof Detection and Real-Time Mitigation of Ransomware Threats
Authors: Md Raz, P.V. Sai Charan, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Ramesh Karri
Abstract: Ransomware's escalating sophistication necessitates tamper-resistant, off-host detection solutions that capture deep disk activity beyond the reach of a compromised operating system while overcoming evasion and obfuscation techniques. To address this, we introduce SHIELD: a metric acquisition framework leveraging low-level filesystem monitoring and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity exhibited by software executing on a target device. We employ Shield within a detection architecture leveraging deep filesystem features along with simplified metrics aggregated based on frequency of disk actions, making the metrics impervious to obfuscation while avoiding reliance on vulnerable host-based logs. We evaluate the efficacy of these metrics through extensive experiments with both binary (benign vs. malicious behavior) and multiclass (ransomware strain identification) classifiers and confirm that our metrics yield high accuracy across diverse threat profiles, including intermittent or partial encryption. In a proof-of-concept deployment, we demonstrate real-time mitigation using models trained on these metrics by halting malicious disk operations after ransomware detection with minimum file loss and memory corruption. We also show that hardware-only features collected independently of OS or network stack retain high detection effectiveness, verifying feasibility of embedding the proposed pipeline in a SATA controller ASIC or FPGA for next-generation, disk-centric defenses that combine filesystem insight with inherent off-host isolation.

Title: UniForm: A Unified Multi-Task Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation
Authors: Lei Zhao, Linfeng Feng, Dongxu Ge, Rujin Chen, Fangqiu Yi, Chi Zhang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we first propose UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that jointly generates audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. A single diffusion process models both audio and video, capturing the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Second, we introduce task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling a single model to support multiple tasks, including text-to-audio-video, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Extensive experiments show that UniForm achieves the state-of-the-art performance across audio-video generation tasks, producing content that is both well-aligned and close to real-world data distributions. Our demos are available at this https URL.

Title: Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization
Authors: Naoki Saito, David Weber
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.

Title: The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous
Authors: Max Simchowitz, Daniel Pfrommer, Ali Jadbabaie
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponentially stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.

Title: Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation
Authors: Khalil Al Salahat, Mohamad El Moussawi, Veera Ganesh Yalla, Ali J. Ghandour
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) plays a vital role in remote sensing due to its ability to capture high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or daylight. However, to transform the raw SAR signals into interpretable imagery, advanced data processing techniques are essential. A widely used technique for this purpose is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA), which takes advantage of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert signals into the frequency domain for further processing. However, the computational cost of this approach becomes significant when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA) that utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to accelerate processing compared to the classical FFT. Furthermore, it introduces a quantum implementation of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, a critical step in the RDA pipeline, and evaluates its performance relative to its classical counterpart.

Title: CAFA: a Controllable Automatic Foley Artist
Authors: Roi Benita, Michael Finkelson, Tavi Halperin, Gleb Sterkin, Yossi Adi
Abstract: Foley is a key element in video production, refers to the process of adding an audio signal to a silent video while ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. In recent years, the rise of personalized content creation and advancements in automatic video-to-audio models have increased the demand for greater user control in the process. One possible approach is to incorporate text to guide audio generation. While supported by existing methods, challenges remain in ensuring compatibility between modalities, particularly when the text introduces additional information or contradicts the sounds naturally inferred from the visuals. In this work, we introduce CAFA (Controllable Automatic Foley Artist) a video-and-text-to-audio model that generates semantically and temporally aligned audio for a given video, guided by text input. CAFA is built upon a text-to-audio model and integrates video information through a modality adapter mechanism. By incorporating text, users can refine semantic details and introduce creative variations, guiding the audio synthesis beyond the expected video contextual cues. Experiments show that besides its superior quality in terms of semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization the proposed method enable high textual controllability as demonstrated in subjective and objective evaluations.
