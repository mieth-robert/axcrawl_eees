Title: Fluid Antenna Enabled Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Joint Optimization of Positioning, Beamforming, and User Selection
Authors: Yang Zhao, Minrui Xu, Ping Wang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) effectively utilizes communication bandwidth, yet it is vulnerable to errors during analog aggregation. While removing users with unfavorable channel conditions can mitigate these errors, it also reduces the available local training data for FL, which in turn hinders the convergence rate of the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose using fluid antenna (FA) techniques to enhance the degrees of freedom within the channel space, ultimately boosting the convergence speed of FL training. Moreover, we develop a novel approach that effectively coordinates uplink receiver beamforming, user selection, and FA positioning to optimize the convergence rate of OTA FL training in dynamic wireless environments. We address this challenging stochastic optimization by reformulating it as a mixed-integer programming problem by utilizing the training loss upper bound. We then introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to solve the mixed-integer mixed programming problem. Experimental results indicate that incorporating FA techniques significantly accelerates the training convergence of FL and greatly surpasses conventional methods.

Title: Observability Investigation for Rotational Calibration of (Global-pose aided) VIO under Straight Line Motion
Authors: Junlin Song, Antoine Richard, Miguel Olivares-Mendez
Abstract: Online extrinsic calibration is crucial for building "power-on-and-go" moving platforms, like robots and AR devices. However, blindly performing online calibration for unobservable parameter may lead to unpredictable results. In the literature, extensive studies have been conducted on the extrinsic calibration between IMU and camera, from theory to practice. It is well-known that the observability of extrinsic parameter can be guaranteed under sufficient motion excitation. Furthermore, the impacts of degenerate motions are also investigated. Despite these successful analyses, we identify an issue regarding the existing observability conclusion. This paper focuses on the observability investigation for straight line motion, which is a common-seen and fundamental degenerate motion in applications. We analytically prove that pure translational straight line motion can lead to the unobservability of the rotational extrinsic parameter between IMU and camera (at least one degree of freedom). By correcting observability conclusion, our novel theoretical finding disseminate more precise principle to the research community and provide explainable calibration guideline for practitioners. Our analysis is validated by rigorous theory and experiments.

Title: A Novel Spatiotemporal Correlation Anomaly Detection Method Based on Time-Frequency-Domain Feature Fusion and a Dynamic Graph Neural Network in Wireless Sensor Network
Authors: Miao Ye, Zhibang Jiang, Xingsi Xue, Xingwang Li, Peng Wen, Yong Wang
Abstract: Attention-based transformers have played an important role in wireless sensor network (WSN) timing anomaly detection due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, there are several issues that must be addressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term dependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels are high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not sufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN timing data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly detection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph neural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework. First, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal components of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of transformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to make full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal data and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based dynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively extract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method designed in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing methods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over that of the existing models.

Title: PCE-GAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Point Cloud Attribute Quality Enhancement based on Optimal Transport
Authors: Tian Guo, Hui Yuan, Qi Liu, Honglei Su, Raouf Hamzaoui, Sam Kwong
Abstract: Point cloud compression significantly reduces data volume but sacrifices reconstruction quality, highlighting the need for advanced quality enhancement techniques. Most existing approaches focus primarily on point-to-point fidelity, often neglecting the importance of perceptual quality as interpreted by the human visual system. To address this issue, we propose a generative adversarial network for point cloud quality enhancement (PCE-GAN), grounded in optimal transport theory, with the goal of simultaneously optimizing both data fidelity and perceptual quality. The generator consists of a local feature extraction (LFE) unit, a global spatial correlation (GSC) unit and a feature squeeze unit. The LFE unit uses dynamic graph construction and a graph attention mechanism to efficiently extract local features, placing greater emphasis on points with severe distortion. The GSC unit uses the geometry information of neighboring patches to construct an extended local neighborhood and introduces a transformer-style structure to capture long-range global correlations. The discriminator computes the deviation between the probability distributions of the enhanced point cloud and the original point cloud, guiding the generator to achieve high quality reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, when applying PCE-GAN to the latest geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC) test model, it achieves an average BD-rate of -19.2% compared with the PredLift coding configuration and -18.3% compared with the RAHT coding configuration. Subjective comparisons show a significant improvement in texture clarity and color transitions, revealing finer details and more natural color gradients.

Title: Tensor-based Model Reduction and Identification for Generalized Memory Polynomial
Authors: Yuchao Wang, Yimin Wei
Abstract: Power amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in wireless communication systems, and the design of their behavioral models has been an important research topic for many years. The widely used generalized memory polynomial (GMP) model suffers from rapid growth in the number of parameters with increasing memory depths and nonlinearity order, which leads to a significant increase in model complexity and the risk of overfitting. In this study, we introduce tensor networks to compress the unknown coefficient tensor of the GMP model, resulting in three novel tensor-based GMP models. These models can achieve comparable performance to the GMP model, but with far fewer parameters and lower complexity. For the identification of these models, we derive the alternating least-squares (ALS) method to ensure the rapid updates and convergence of model parameters in an iterative manner. In addition, we notice that the horizontal slices of the third-order data tensor constructed from the input signals are Vandermonde matrices, which have a numerically low-rank structure. Hence, we further propose the RP-ALS algorithm, which first performs a truncated higher-order singular value decomposition on the data tensor to generate random projections, then conducts the ALS algorithm for the identification of projected models with downscaled dimensions, thus reducing the computational effort of the iterative process. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform the full GMP model and sparse GMP model via LASSO regression in terms of the reduction in the number of parameters and running complexity.

Title: EXACT-CT: EXplainable Analysis for Crohn's and Tuberculosis using CT
Authors: Shashwat Gupta, Sarthak Gupta, Akshan Agrawal, Mahim Naaz, Rajanikanth Yadav, Priyanka Bagade
Abstract: Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis share many overlapping features such as clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features - particularly granulomas, making it challenging to clinically differentiate them. Our research leverages 3D CTE scans, computer vision, and machine learning to improve this differentiation to avoid harmful treatment mismanagement such as unnecessary anti-tuberculosis therapy for Crohn's disease or exacerbation of tuberculosis with immunosuppressants. Our study proposes a novel method to identify radiologist - identified biomarkers such as VF to SF ratio, necrosis, calcifications, comb sign and pulmonary TB to enhance accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness by using different ML techniques on the features extracted from these biomarkers, computing SHAP on XGBoost for understanding feature importance towards predictions, and comparing against SOTA methods such as pretrained ResNet and CTFoundation.

Title: Manifold Topological Deep Learning for Biomedical Data
Authors: Xiang Liu, Zhe Su, Yongyi Shi, Yiying Tong, Ge Wang, Guo-Wei Wei
Abstract: Recently, topological deep learning (TDL), which integrates algebraic topology with deep neural networks, has achieved tremendous success in processing point-cloud data, emerging as a promising paradigm in data science. However, TDL has not been developed for data on differentiable manifolds, including images, due to the challenges posed by differential topology. We address this challenge by introducing manifold topological deep learning (MTDL) for the first time. To highlight the power of Hodge theory rooted in differential topology, we consider a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) in MTDL. In this novel framework, original images are represented as smooth manifolds with vector fields that are decomposed into three orthogonal components based on Hodge theory. These components are then concatenated to form an input image for the CNN architecture. The performance of MTDL is evaluated using the MedMNIST v2 benchmark database, which comprises 717,287 biomedical images from eleven 2D and six 3D datasets. MTDL significantly outperforms other competing methods, extending TDL to a wide range of data on smooth manifolds.

Title: Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for State Avoidance in Discrete Event Systems
Authors: Md Nur-A-Adam Dony, Jing Yang
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a potent paradigm for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. However, the integration of event-driven decision processes within RL remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel architecture that combines a Discrete Event Supervisory (DES) model with a standard RL framework to create a hybrid decision-making system. Our model leverages the DES's capabilities in managing event-based dynamics with the RL agent's adaptability to continuous states and actions, facilitating a more robust and flexible control strategy in systems characterized by both continuous and discrete events. The DES model operates alongside the RL agent, enhancing the policy's performance with event-based insights, while the environment's state transitions are governed by a mechanistic model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations that show improved performance metrics over traditional RL implementations. Our results suggest that this integrated approach holds promise for applications ranging from industrial automation to intelligent traffic systems, where discrete event handling is paramount.

Title: Physics-Informed Implicit Neural Representations for Joint B0 Estimation and Echo Planar Imaging
Authors: Wenqi Huang, Nan Wang, Congyu Liao, Yimeng Lin, Mengze Gao, Daniel Rueckert, Kawin Setsompop
Abstract: Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) is widely used for its rapid acquisition but suffers from severe geometric distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities, particularly along the phase encoding direction. Existing methods follow a two-step process: reconstructing blip-up/down EPI images, then estimating B0, which can introduce error accumulation and reduce correction accuracy. This is especially problematic in high B0 regions, where distortions align along the same axis, making them harder to disentangle. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with a physics-informed correction model to jointly estimate B0 inhomogeneities and reconstruct distortion-free images from rotated-view EPI acquisitions. INRs offer a flexible, continuous representation that inherently captures complex spatial variations without requiring predefined grid-based field maps. By leveraging this property, our method dynamically adapts to subject-specific B0 variations and improves robustness across different imaging conditions. Experimental results on 180 slices of brain images from three subjects demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of reconstruction quality and field estimation accuracy.

Title: Boundary-Emphasized Weight Maps for Distal Airway Segmentation
Authors: Ali Keshavarzi, Elsa Angelini
Abstract: Automated airway segmentation from lung CT scans is vital for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary diseases. Despite advancements, challenges like leakage, breakage, and class imbalance persist, particularly in capturing small airways and preserving topology. We propose the Boundary-Emphasized Loss (BEL), which enhances boundary preservation using a boundary-based weight map and an adaptive weight refinement strategy. Unlike centerline-based approaches, BEL prioritizes boundary voxels to reduce misclassification, improve topology, and enhance structural consistency, especially on distal airway branches. Evaluated on ATM22 and AIIB23, BEL outperforms baseline loss functions, achieving higher topology-related metrics and comparable overall-based measures. Qualitative results further highlight BEL's ability to capture fine anatomical details and reduce segmentation errors, particularly in small airways. These findings establish BEL as a promising solution for accurate and topology-enhancing airway segmentation in medical imaging.

Title: Traffic Priority-Aware 5G NR-U/Wi-Fi Coexistence with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Mohammad Reza Fasihi, Brian L. Mark
Abstract: Coexistence of 5G new radio unlicensed (NR-U) and Wi-Fi is highly prone to the collisions among NR-U gNBs (5G base stations) and Wi-Fi APs (access points). To improve performance and fairness for both networks, various collision resolution mechanisms have been proposed to replace the simple listen-before-talk (LBT) scheme used in the current 5G standard. We address two gaps in the literature: first, the lack of a comprehensive performance comparison among the proposed collision resolution mechanisms and second, the impact of multiple traffic priority classes. Through extensive simulations, we compare the performance of several recently proposed collision resolution mechanisms for NR-U/Wi-Fi coexistence. We extend one of these mechanisms to handle multiple traffic priorities. We then develop a traffic-aware multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the scenario of coexistence of high-priority traffic gNB user equipment (UE) with multiple lower-priority traffic UEs and Wi-Fi stations. The objective is to ensure low latency for high-priority gNB traffic while increasing the airtime fairness among the NR-U and Wi-Fi networks. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm lowers the channel access delay of high-priority traffic while improving the fairness among both networks.

Title: SegImgNet: Segmentation-Guided Dual-Branch Network for Retinal Disease Diagnoses
Authors: Xinwei Luo, Songlin Zhao, Yun Zong, Yong Chen, Gui-shuang Ying, Lifang He
Abstract: Retinal image plays a crucial role in diagnosing various diseases, as retinal structures provide essential diagnostic information. However, effectively capturing structural features while integrating them with contextual information from retinal images remains a challenge. In this work, we propose segmentation-guided dual-branch network for retinal disease diagnosis using retinal images and their segmentation maps, named SegImgNet. SegImgNet incorporates a segmentation module to generate multi-scale retinal structural feature maps from retinal images. The classification module employs two encoders to independently extract features from segmented images and retinal images for disease classification. To further enhance feature extraction, we introduce the Segmentation-Guided Attention (SGA) block, which leverages feature maps from the segmentation module to refine the classification process. We evaluate SegImgNet on the public AIROGS dataset and the private e-ROP dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SegImgNet consistently outperforms existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness in retinal disease diagnosis. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Advances in Anti-Deception Jamming Strategies for Radar Systems: A Survey
Authors: Helena Calatrava, Shuo Tang, Pau Closas
Abstract: Deception jamming has long been a significant threat to radar systems, interfering with search, acquisition, and tracking by introducing false information that diverts attention from the targets of interest. As deception strategies become more sophisticated, the vulnerability of radar systems to these attacks continues to escalate. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the evolution of anti-deception jamming techniques, starting with legacy solutions and progressing to the latest advancements. Current research is categorized into three key areas: prevention strategies, which hinder the ability of jammers to alter radar processing; detection strategies, which alert the system to deception and may classify the type of attack; and mitigation strategies, which aim to reduce or suppress the impact of jamming. Additionally, key avenues for further research are highlighted, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cognitive, and AI-enabled radar systems. We envision this paper as a gateway to the existing literature on anti-deception jamming, a critical area for safeguarding radar systems against evolving threats.

Title: Efficient Fault Diagnosis in Lithium-Ion Battery Packs: A Structural Approach with Moving Horizon Estimation
Authors: Amir Farakhor, Di Wu, Yebin Wang, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Safe and reliable operation of lithium-ion battery packs depends on effective fault diagnosis. However, model-based approaches often encounter two major challenges: high computational complexity and extensive sensor requirements. To address these bottlenecks, this paper introduces a novel approach that harnesses the structural properties of battery packs, including cell uniformity and the sparsity of fault occurrences. We integrate this approach into a Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) framework and estimate fault signals such as internal and external short circuits and faults in voltage and current sensors. To mitigate computational demands, we propose a hierarchical solution to the MHE problem. The proposed solution breaks up the pack-level MHE problem into smaller problems and solves them efficiently. Finally, we perform extensive simulations across various battery pack configurations and fault types to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results highlight that the proposed approach simultaneously reduces the computational demands and sensor requirements of fault diagnosis.

Title: Communication and Control Co-design in Non-cooperative Games
Authors: Shubham Aggarwal, Tamer Başar, Dipankar Maity
Abstract: In this article, we revisit a communication-control co-design problem for a class of two-player stochastic differential games on an infinite horizon. Each 'player' represents two active decision makers, namely a scheduler and a remote controller, which cooperate to optimize over a global objective while competing with the other player. Each player's scheduler can only intermittently relay state information to its respective controller due to associated cost/constraint to communication. The scheduler's policy determines the information structure at the controller, thereby affecting the quality of the control inputs. Consequently, it leads to the classical communication-control trade-off problem. A high communication frequency improves the control performance of the player on account of a higher communication cost, and vice versa. Under suitable information structures of the players, we first compute the Nash controller policies for both players in terms of the conditional estimate of the state. Consequently, we reformulate the problem of computing Nash scheduler policies (within a class of parametrized randomized policies) into solving for the steady-state solution of a generalized Sylvester equation. Since the above-mentioned reformulation involves infinite sum of powers of the policy parameters, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to numerically compute a Nash equilibrium using a truncated polynomial approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the Nash control and scheduler policies using extensive numerical simulations.

Title: UL-UNAS: Ultra-Lightweight U-Nets for Real-Time Speech Enhancement via Network Architecture Search
Authors: Xiaobin Rong, Dahan Wang, Yuxiang Hu, Changbao Zhu, Kai Chen, Jing LOu
Abstract: Lightweight models are essential for real-time speech enhancement applications. In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward developing increasingly compact models for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose an Ultra-Lightweight U-net optimized by Network Architecture Search (UL-UNAS), which is suitable for implementation in low-footprint devices. Firstly, we explore the application of various efficient convolutional blocks within the U-Net framework to identify the most promising candidates. Secondly, we introduce two boosting components to enhance the capacity of these convolutional blocks: a novel activation function named affine PReLU and a causal time-frequency attention module. Furthermore, we leverage neural architecture search to discover an optimal architecture within our carefully designed search space. By integrating the above strategies, UL-UNAS not only significantly outperforms the latest ultra-lightweight models with the same or lower computational complexity, but also delivers competitive performance compared to recent baseline models that require substantially higher computational resources.

Title: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Enhanced MIMO OFDM Wideband Communication Systems
Authors: Zheao Li, Jiancheng An, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely on digital or hybrid digital and analog designs for beamforming against frequency-selective fading, which suffer from high hardware complexity and energy consumption. To address this, this work introduces a fully-analog stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) architecture that directly performs wave-domain beamforming, enabling diagonalization of the end-to-end channel matrix and inherently eliminating inter-antenna interference (IAI) for MIMO OFDM transmission. By leveraging cascaded programmable metasurface layers, the proposed system establishes multiple parallel subchannels, significantly improving multi-carrier transmission efficiency while reducing hardware complexity. To optimize the SIM phase shift matrices, a block coordinate descent and penalty convex-concave procedure (BCD-PCCP) algorithm is developed to iteratively minimize the channel fitting error across subcarriers. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, determining the maximum effective bandwidth and demonstrating substantial performance improvements. Moreover, for a MIMO OFDM system operating at 28 GHz with 16 subcarriers, the proposed SIM configuration method achieves over 300\% enhancement in channel capacity compared to conventional SIM configuration that only accounts for the center frequency.

Title: Adaptive Wall-Following Control for Unmanned Ground Vehicles Using Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Hengye Yang, Yanxiao Chen, Zexuan Fan, Lin Shao, Tao Sun
Abstract: Unmanned ground vehicles operating in complex environments must adaptively adjust to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances to perform tasks such as wall following and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces an adaptive control approach based on spiking neural networks for wall fitting and tracking, which learns and adapts to unforeseen disturbances. We propose real-time wall-fitting algorithms to model unknown wall shapes and generate corresponding trajectories for the vehicle to follow. A discretized linear quadratic regulator is developed to provide a baseline control signal based on an ideal vehicle model. Point matching algorithms then identify the nearest matching point on the trajectory to generate feedforward control inputs. Finally, an adaptive spiking neural network controller, which adjusts its connection weights online based on error signals, is integrated with the aforementioned control algorithms. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this adaptive control framework outperforms the traditional linear quadratic regulator in tracking complex trajectories and following irregular walls, even in the presence of partial actuator failures and state estimation errors.

Title: Model-Agnostic Meta-Policy Optimization via Zeroth-Order Estimation: A Linear Quadratic Regulator Perspective
Authors: Yunian Pan, Tao Li, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: Meta-learning has been proposed as a promising machine learning topic in recent years, with important applications to image classification, robotics, computer games, and control systems. In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide stability and convergence guarantees for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and local smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We provide the sample complexity conditions for these theoretical guarantees, as well as a numerical example at the end to corroborate this perspective.

Title: Prognostic Model for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Using Context-Aware Sequential-Parallel Hybrid Transformer and Enriched Clinical Information
Authors: Mahdie Dolatabadi, Shahabedin Nabavi, Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam
Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease that irreversibly transforms lung tissue into rigid fibrotic structures, leading to debilitating symptoms such as shortness of breath and chronic fatigue. The heterogeneity and complexity of this disease, particularly regarding its severity and progression rate, have made predicting its future course a complex and challenging task. Besides, traditional diagnostic methods based on clinical evaluations and imaging have limitations in capturing the disease's complexity. Using the Kaggle Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression dataset, which includes computed tomography images, and clinical information, the model predicts changes in forced vital capacity (FVC), a key progression indicator. Our method uses a proposed context-aware sequential-parallel hybrid transformer model and clinical information enrichment for its prediction. The proposed method achieved a Laplace Log-Likelihood score of -6.508, outperforming prior methods and demonstrating superior predictive capabilities. These results highlight the potential of advanced deep learning techniques to provide more accurate and timely predictions, offering a transformative approach to the diagnosis and management of IPF, with implications for improved patient outcomes and therapeutic advancements.

Title: Toward AIML Enabled WiFi Beamforming CSI Feedback Compression: An Overview of IEEE 802.11 Standardization
Authors: Ziming He
Abstract: Transmit beamforming is one of the key techniques used in the existing IEEE 802.11 WiFi standards and future generations such as 11be and 11bn, a.k.a., ultra high reliability (UHR). The paper gives an overview of the current standardization activities regarding the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AIML) enabled beamforming channel state information (CSI) feedback compression technique, defined by the 802.11 AIML topic interest group (TIG). Two key challenges the AIML TIG is going to tackle in the future beamforming standards and four defined key performance indicators (KPIs) for the AIML enabled schemes are discussed in the paper. The two challenges are the CSI feedback overhead and the compression complexity, and the four KPIs are feedback overhead, AIML model sharing overhead, packet error rate and complexity. Moreover, the paper presents a couple of AIML enabled compression schemes accepted by the TIG, such as the K-means and autoencoder based schemes, and uses simulated and analyzed data to explain how these schemes are designed according to the KPIs. Finally, future research directions are indicated for encouraging more researchers and engineers to contribute to this technique and the standardization of the next generation WiFi beamforming.

Title: A physics-informed Bayesian optimization method for rapid development of electrical machines
Authors: Pedram Asef, Christopher Vagg
Abstract: Advanced slot and winding designs are imperative to create future high performance electrical machines (EM). As a result, the development of methods to design and improve slot filling factor (SFF) has attracted considerable research. Recent developments in manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing and alternative materials, has also highlighted a need for novel high-fidelity design techniques to develop high performance complex geometries and topologies. This study therefore introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PIML) design optimization process for improving SFF in traction electrical machines used in electric vehicles. A maximum entropy sampling algorithm (MESA) is used to seed a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) algorithm, where the target function and its approximations are produced by Gaussian processes (GP)s. The proposed PIBO-MESA is coupled with a 2D finite element model (FEM) to perform a GP-based surrogate and provide the first demonstration of the optimal combination of complex design variables for an electrical machine. Significant computational gains were achieved using the new PIBO-MESA approach, which is 45% faster than existing stochastic methods, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The FEM results confirm that the new design optimization process and keystone shaped wires lead to a higher SFF (i.e. by 20%) and electromagnetic improvements (e.g. maximum torque by 12%) with similar resistivity. The newly developed PIBO-MESA design optimization process therefore presents significant benefits in the design of high-performance electric machines, with reduced development time and costs.

Title: Certifying Lyapunov Stability of Black-Box Nonlinear Systems via Counterexample Guided Synthesis (Extended Version)
Authors: Chiao Hsieh (1), Masaki Waga (1), Kohei Suenaga (1) ((1) Kyoto University)
Abstract: Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has been an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing methods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the system. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however remains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled control systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box systems would have much wider applications. Our work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz continuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one can derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a strong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We significantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of Lyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the learner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and counterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove stability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination. Our numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability of 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples. Our visualization also reveals the regions where the stability is difficult to prove. In comparison with the existing black-box approach, our approach at the best case requires less than 0.01% of samples.

Title: Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints
Authors: Francesco Binucci, Osvaldo Simeone, Paolo Banelli
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.

Title: LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Boyi Kang, Xinfa Zhu, Zihan Zhang, Zhen Ye, Mingshuai Liu, Ziqian Wang, Yike Zhu, Guobin Ma, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Wei Xue, Lei Xie
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.

Title: BELE: Blur Equivalent Linearized Estimator
Authors: Paolo Giannitrapani, Elio D. Di Claudio, Giovanni Jacovitti
Abstract: In the Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment context, Mean Opinion Score values represent subjective evaluations based on retinal perception, while objective metrics assess the reproduced image on the display. Bridging these subjective and objective domains requires parametric mapping functions, which are sensitive to the observer's viewing distance. This paper introduces a novel parametric model that separates perceptual effects due to strong edge degradations from those caused by texture distortions. These effects are quantified using two distinct quality indices. The first is the Blur Equivalent Linearized Estimator, designed to measure blur on strong and isolated edges while accounting for variations in viewing distance. The second is a Complex Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, which evaluates distortions affecting texture regions. The first-order effects of the estimator are directly tied to the first index, for which we introduce the concept of \emph{focalization}, interpreted as a linearization term. Starting from a Positional Fisher Information loss model applied to Gaussian blur distortion in natural images, we demonstrate how this model can generalize to linearize all types of distortions. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings by comparing them with several state-of-the-art classical and deep-learning-based full-reference image quality assessment methods on widely used benchmark datasets.

Title: NeuroSymAD: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Interpretable Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang, Yuning Zhang, Tingting Dan, Tianlong Chen, Guorong Wu, Ang Li
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is complex, requiring the integration of imaging and clinical data for accurate assessment. While deep learning has shown promise in brain MRI analysis, it often functions as a black box, limiting interpretability and lacking mechanisms to effectively integrate critical clinical data such as biomarkers, medical history, and demographic information. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuroSymAD, a neuro-symbolic framework that synergizes neural networks with symbolic reasoning. A neural network percepts brain MRI scans, while a large language model (LLM) distills medical rules to guide a symbolic system in reasoning over biomarkers and medical history. This structured integration enhances both diagnostic accuracy and explainability. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that NeuroSymAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.91% in accuracy and 3.43% in F1-score while providing transparent and interpretable diagnosis.

Title: Co-state Neural Network for Real-time Nonlinear Optimal Control with Input Constraints
Authors: Lihan Lian, Uduak Inyang-Udoh
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to solve nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs) with constrained control input in real-time using neural networks (NNs). We introduce what we have termed co-state Neural Network (CoNN) that learns the mapping from any given state value to its corresponding optimal co-state trajectory based on the Pontryagin's Minimum (Maximum) Principle (PMP). In essence, the CoNN parameterizes the Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) that results from the PMP for various initial states. The CoNN is trained using data generated from numerical solutions of TPBVPs for unconstrained OCPs to learn the mapping from a state to its corresponding optimal co-state trajectory. For better generalizability, the CoNN is also trained to respect the first-order optimality conditions (system dynamics). The control input constraints are satisfied by solving a quadratic program (QP) given the predicted optimal co-states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CoNN-based controller in a feedback scheme for numerical examples with both unconstrained and constrained control input. We also verify that the controller can handle unknown disturbances effectively.

Title: Predicting Cascading Failures in Power Systems using Machine Learning
Authors: Samita Rani Pani, Pallav Kumar Bera, Rajat Kanti Samal
Abstract: Cascading failure studies help assess and enhance the robustness of power systems against severe power outages. Onset time is a critical parameter in the analysis and management of power system stability and reliability, representing the timeframe within which initial disturbances may lead to subsequent cascading failures. In this paper, different traditional machine learning algorithms are used to predict the onset time of cascading failures. The prediction task is articulated as a multi-class classification problem, employing machine learning algorithms. The results on the UIUC 150-Bus power system data available publicly show high classification accuracy with Random Forest. The hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier are tuned using Bayesian Optimization. This study highlights the potential of machine learning models in predicting cascading failures, providing a foundation for the development of more resilient power systems.

Title: Cross-Attention Fusion of MRI and Jacobian Maps for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Shijia Zhang, Xiyu Ding, Brian Caffo, Junyu Chen, Cindy Zhang, Hadi Kharrazi, Zheyu Wang
Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for intervention before irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. Structural MRI (sMRI) is widely used for AD diagnosis, but conventional deep learning approaches primarily rely on intensity-based features, which require large datasets to capture subtle structural changes. Jacobian determinant maps (JSM) provide complementary information by encoding localized brain deformations, yet existing multimodal fusion strategies fail to fully integrate these features with sMRI. We propose a cross-attention fusion framework to model the intrinsic relationship between sMRI intensity and JSM-derived deformations for AD classification. Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we compare cross-attention, pairwise self-attention, and bottleneck attention with four pre-trained 3D image encoders. Cross-attention fusion achieves superior performance, with mean ROC-AUC scores of 0.903 (+/-0.033) for AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and 0.692 (+/-0.061) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. CN. Despite its strong performance, our model remains highly efficient, with only 1.56 million parameters--over 40 times fewer than ResNet-34 (63M) and Swin UNETR (61.98M). These findings demonstrate the potential of cross-attention fusion for improving AD diagnosis while maintaining computational efficiency.

Title: Optimizing Parameter Estimation for Electrochemical Battery Model: A Comparative Analysis of Operating Profiles on Computational Efficiency and Accuracy
Authors: Feng Guo, Luis D. Couto, Khiem Trada, Grietus Muldera, Keivan Haghverdi, Guillaume Thenaisie
Abstract: Parameter estimation in electrochemical models remains a significant challenge in their application. This study investigates the impact of different operating profiles on electrochemical model parameter estimation to identify the optimal conditions. In particular, the present study is focused on Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(NMC) lithium-ion batteries. Based on five fundamental current profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST), 31 combinations of conditions were generated and used for parameter estimation and validation, resulting in 961 evaluation outcomes. The Particle Swarm Optimization is employed for parameter identification in electrochemical models, specifically using the Single Particle Model (SPM). The analysis considered three dimensions: model voltage output error, parameter estimation error, and time cost. Results show that using all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output error, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The shortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage output and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal. For minimizing model voltage output error and time cost, {C/2, 1C} is best, while {1C} is ideal for parameter error and time cost. The comprehensive optimal condition is {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST}. These findings provide guidance for selecting current conditions tailored to specific needs.

Title: Net-Zero Integrated Sensing and Communication in Backscatter Systems
Authors: Yu Zhang, Tongyang Xu, Christos Masouros, Zhu Han
Abstract: Future wireless networks targeted for improving spectral and energy efficiency, are expected to simultaneously provide sensing functionality and support low-power communications. This paper proposes a novel net-zero integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) model for backscatter systems, including an access point (AP), a net-zero device, and a user receiver. We fully utilize the backscatter mechanism for sensing and communication without additional power consumption and signal processing in the hardware device, which reduces the system complexity and makes it feasible for practical applications. To further optimize the system performance, we design a novel signal frame structure for the ISAC model that effectively mitigates communication interference at the transmitter, tag, and receiver. Additionally, we employ distributed antennas for sensing which can be placed flexibly to capture a wider range of signals from diverse angles and distances, thereby improving the accuracy of sensing. We derive theoretical expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and tag's location detection probability, and provide a detailed analysis of how the system parameters, such as transmit power and tag's reflection coefficient, affect the system performance.

Title: ExAMPC: the Data-Driven Explainable and Approximate NMPC with Physical Insights
Authors: Jean Pierre Allamaa, Panagiotis Patrinos, Tong Duy Son
Abstract: Amidst the surge in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for control purposes, classical and model-based control methods maintain their popularity due to their transparency and deterministic nature. However, advanced controllers like Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), despite proven capabilities, face adoption challenges due to their computational complexity and unpredictable closed-loop performance in complex validation systems. This paper introduces ExAMPC, a methodology bridging classical control and explainable AI by augmenting the NMPC with data-driven insights to improve the trustworthiness and reveal the optimization solution and closed-loop performance's sensitivities to physical variables and system parameters. By employing a low-order spline embedding to reduce the open-loop trajectory dimensionality by over 95%, and integrating it with SHAP and Symbolic Regression from eXplainable AI (XAI) for an approximate NMPC, we enable intuitive physical insights into the NMPC's optimization routine. The prediction accuracy of the approximate NMPC is enhanced through physics-inspired continuous-time constraints penalties, reducing the predicted continuous trajectory violations by 93%. ExAMPC enables accurate forecasting of the NMPC's computational requirements with explainable insights on worst-case scenarios. Experimental validation on automated valet parking and autonomous racing with lap-time optimization NMPC, demonstrates the methodology's practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

Title: Artificially Generated Visual Scanpath Improves Multi-label Thoracic Disease Classification in Chest X-Ray Images
Authors: Ashish Verma, Aupendu Kar, Krishnendu Ghosh, Sobhan Kanti Dhara, Debashis Sen, Prabir Kumar Biswas
Abstract: Expert radiologists visually scan Chest X-Ray (CXR) images, sequentially fixating on anatomical structures to perform disease diagnosis. An automatic multi-label classifier of diseases in CXR images can benefit by incorporating aspects of the radiologists' approach. Recorded visual scanpaths of radiologists on CXR images can be used for the said purpose. But, such scanpaths are not available for most CXR images, which creates a gap even for modern deep learning based classifiers. This paper proposes to mitigate this gap by generating effective artificial visual scanpaths using a visual scanpath prediction model for CXR images. Further, a multi-class multi-label classifier framework is proposed that uses a generated scanpath and visual image features to classify diseases in CXR images. While the scanpath predictor is based on a recurrent neural network, the multi-label classifier involves a novel iterative sequential model with an attention module. We show that our scanpath predictor generates human-like visual scanpaths. We also demonstrate that the use of artificial visual scanpaths improves multi-class multi-label disease classification results on CXR images. The above observations are made from experiments involving around 0.2 million CXR images from 2 widely-used datasets considering the multi-label classification of 14 pathological findings.

Title: Learning for Feasible Region on Coal Mine Virtual Power Plants with Imperfect Information
Authors: Hongxu Huang, Ruike Lyu, Cheng Feng, Haiwang Zhong, H. B. Gooi, Bo Li, Rui Liang
Abstract: The feasible region assessment (FRA) in industrial virtual power plants (VPPs) is driven by the need to activate large-scale latent industrial loads for demand response, making it essential to aggregate these flexible resources for peak regulation. However, the large number of devices and the need for privacy preservation in coal mines pose challenges to accurately aggregating these resources into a cohesive coal mine VPP. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable data-driven approach for FRA in the coal mine VPP that can manage incomplete information. Our data-driven FRA algorithm approximates equipment and FRA parameters based on historical energy dispatch data, effectively addressing the challenges of imperfect information. Simulation results illustrate that our method approximates the accurate feasible operational boundaries under dynamic and imperfect information conditions.

Title: Rate Splitting Multiple Access for Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer
Authors: Zhengqing Qiu, Yijie Mao
Abstract: This paper initiate the application of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) for simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT), where users require to decode information and harvest energy. We focus on a time-splitting (TS) mode where information decoding and energy harvesting are separated in two different phases. Based on the proposed system model, we design a constrained-concave-convex programming (CCCP) algorithm to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the worst-case rate among users subject to the harvested energy constraint at each user. Specifically, the proposed algorithm exploits transformation of the bilinear function, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), CCCP, and a penalty method to effectively deal with the non-convex constraints and objective function. Numerical results show that our proposed RSMA-aided SLIPT outperforms the existing baselines based on space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).

Title: An Approach of Directly Tracking Multiple Objects
Authors: Mingchao Liang, Florian Meyer
Abstract: In conventional approaches for multiobject tracking (MOT), raw sensor data undergoes several preprocessing stages to reduce data rate and computational complexity. This typically includes coherent processing that aims at maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), followed by a detector that extracts "point" measurements, e.g., the range and bearing of objects, which serve as inputs for sequential Bayesian MOT. While using point measurements significantly simplifies the statistical model, the reduced data rate can lead to a loss of critical, object-related information and, thus, potentially to reduced tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a direct tracking approach that avoids a detector and most preprocessing stages. For direct tracking, we introduce a measurement model for the data-generating process of the sensor data, along with state-transition and birth models for the dynamics and the appearance and disappearance of objects. Based on the new statistical model, we develop a factor graph and particle-based belief propagation (BP) method for efficient sequential Bayesian estimation. Contrary to the track-before-detect (TBD) paradigm which also avoids a detector, direct tracking integrates coherent processing within the Bayesian MOT framework. Numerical experiments based on a passive acoustic dataset demonstrate that the proposed direct approach outperforms state-of-the-art conventional methods that rely on multiple preprocessing stages.

Title: UniWav: Towards Unified Pre-training for Speech Representation Learning and Generation
Authors: Alexander H. Liu, Sang-gil Lee, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Yuan Gong, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, James R. Glass, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro
Abstract: Pre-training and representation learning have been playing an increasingly important role in modern speech processing. Nevertheless, different applications have been relying on different foundation models, since predominant pre-training techniques are either designed for discriminative tasks or generative tasks. In this work, we make the first attempt at building a unified pre-training framework for both types of tasks in speech. We show that with the appropriate design choices for pre-training, one can jointly learn a representation encoder and generative audio decoder that can be applied to both types of tasks. We propose UniWav, an encoder-decoder framework designed to unify pre-training representation learning and generative tasks. On speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech tokenization, UniWav achieves comparable performance to different existing foundation models, each trained on a specific task. Our findings suggest that a single general-purpose foundation model for speech can be built to replace different foundation models, reducing the overhead and cost of pre-training.

Title: LesionDiffusion: Towards Text-controlled General Lesion Synthesis
Authors: Henrui Tian, Wenhui Lei, Linrui Dai, Hanyu Chen, Xiaofan Zhang
Abstract: Fully-supervised lesion recognition methods in medical imaging face challenges due to the reliance on large annotated datasets, which are expensive and difficult to collect. To address this, synthetic lesion generation has become a promising approach. However, existing models struggle with scalability, fine-grained control over lesion attributes, and the generation of complex structures. We propose LesionDiffusion, a text-controllable lesion synthesis framework for 3D CT imaging that generates both lesions and corresponding masks. By utilizing a structured lesion report template, our model provides greater control over lesion attributes and supports a wider variety of lesion types. We introduce a dataset of 1,505 annotated CT scans with paired lesion masks and structured reports, covering 14 lesion types across 8 organs. LesionDiffusion consists of two components: a lesion mask synthesis network (LMNet) and a lesion inpainting network (LINet), both guided by lesion attributes and image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LesionDiffusion significantly improves segmentation performance, with strong generalization to unseen lesion types and organs, outperforming current state-of-the-art models.

Title: Geodesic Diffusion Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation
Authors: Teng Zhang, Hongxu Jiang, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao
Abstract: Diffusion models transform an unknown data distribution into a Gaussian prior by progressively adding noise until the data become indistinguishable from pure noise. This stochastic process traces a path in probability space, evolving from the original data distribution (considered as a Gaussian with near-zero variance) to an isotropic Gaussian. The denoiser then learns to reverse this process, generating high-quality samples from random Gaussian noise. However, standard diffusion models, such as the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), do not ensure a geodesic (i.e., shortest) path in probability space. This inefficiency necessitates the use of many intermediate time steps, leading to high computational costs in training and sampling. To address this limitation, we propose the Geodesic Diffusion Model (GDM), which defines a geodesic path under the Fisher-Rao metric with a variance-exploding noise scheduler. This formulation transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian prior with minimal energy, significantly improving the efficiency of diffusion models. We trained GDM by continuously sampling time steps from 0 to 1 and using as few as 15 evenly spaced time steps for model sampling. We evaluated GDM on two medical image-to-image generation tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by a 50-fold compared to DDPM and 10-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, with 66 times faster sampling than DDPM and a similar sampling speed to Fast-DDPM. These efficiency gains enable rapid model exploration and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: NCF: Neural Correspondence Field for Medical Image Registration
Authors: Lei Zhou, Nimu Yuan, Katjana Ehrlich, Jinyi Qi
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing. Traditional optimization-based methods often struggle with accuracy in dealing with complex deformation. Recently, learning-based methods have achieved good performance on public datasets, but the scarcity of medical image data makes it challenging to build a generalizable model to handle diverse real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a training-data-free learning-based method, Neural Correspondence Field (NCF), which can learn from just one data pair. Our approach employs a compact neural network to model the correspondence field and optimize model parameters for each individual image pair. Consequently, each pair has a unique set of network weights. Notably, our model is highly efficient, utilizing only 0.06 million parameters. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method achieved superior performance on a public Lung CT dataset and outperformed a traditional method on a head and neck dataset, demonstrating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

Title: Extended Impedance Modal Analysis of Internal Dynamics in Grid-Following Inverters
Authors: Le Zheng, Jiajie Zheng, Lei Chen, Chongru Liu
Abstract: As the penetration of Grid-Following inverters (GFL) in power systems continues to increase, the dynamic characteristics of power systems undergo significant transformations. Recently, modal analysis based on the impedance model (MAI) has been utilized to evaluate the interaction between GFLs and the power grid through impedance/admittance participation factors (PF). However, MAI relies on the impedance model that characterizes the input-output behavior of the ports, treating the GFL as a single integrated entity. This approach limits its ability to reveal the complex dynamic coupling mechanism between different control loops inside the GFL. In this paper, we propose an extended impedance modal analysis (EMAI) method. Firstly, the equivalent dynamics of the GFL are decomposed into two components: the synchronous dynamic dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL) and the electromagnetic dynamic dominated by the current control loop (CCL). The PF and participation ratios (PR) of these two dynamic components are then calculated to identify the dominant dynamics of the system. Building on this, we introduce the explicit parameter participation factors (PPF) to further pinpoint the key parameters of the dominant control loop, which provides a way for enhancing system stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the simulation of the modified 14-bus and 68-bus systems. The EMAI method enables the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of each control loop in the GFL based on the impedance model. It can effectively identify the critical control loops influencing system stability without requiring the construction of a full state-space model, demonstrating its broad applicability and value.

Title: Towards Quantum SAGINs Harnessing Optical RISs: Applications, Advances, and the Road Ahead
Authors: Phuc V. Trinh, Shinya Sugiura, Chao Xu, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) concept is vital for the development of seamless next-generation (NG) wireless coverage, integrating satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and manned aircraft along with the terrestrial infrastructure to provide resilient ubiquitous communications. By incorporating quantum communications using optical wireless signals, SAGIN is expected to support a synergistic global quantum Internet alongside classical networks. However, long-distance optical beam propagation requires line-of-sight (LoS) connections in the face of beam broadening and LoS blockages. To overcome blockages among SAGIN nodes, we propose deploying optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) on building rooftops. They can also adaptively control optical beam diameters for reducing losses. This article first introduces the applications of ORISs in SAGINs, then examines their advances in quantum communications for typical SAGIN scenarios. Finally, the road ahead towards the practical realization of ORIS-aided NG quantum SAGINs is outlined.

Title: Patient-Level Anatomy Meets Scanning-Level Physics: Personalized Federated Low-Dose CT Denoising Empowered by Large Language Model
Authors: Ziyuan Yang, Yingyu Chen, Zhiwen Wang, Hongming Shan, Yang Chen, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Reducing radiation doses benefits patients, however, the resultant low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images often suffer from clinically unacceptable noise and artifacts. While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.

Title: Impact of Fasteners on the Radar Cross-Section performance of Radar Absorbing Air Intake Duct
Authors: Vijay Kumar Sutrakar, Anjana P K
Abstract: An aircraft consists of various cavities including air intake ducts, cockpit, radome, inlet and exhaust of heat exchangers, passage for engine bay/other bay cooling etc. These cavities are prime radar cross-section (RCS) contributors of aircraft. The major such cavity is air intake duct, and it contributes significantly to frontal sector RCS of an aircraft. The RCS reductions of air intake duct is very important to achieve a low RCS (or stealthy) aircraft configuration. In general, radar absorbing materials (RAM) are getting utilized for RCS reduction of air intake duct. It can also be noticed that a large number of fasteners are used for integration of air intake duct with the aircraft structures. The installation of fasteners on RAS may lead to degradation of RCS performance of air intake. However, no such studies are reported in the literature on the impact of rivets on the RCS performance of RAS air intake duct. In this paper, radar absorbing material of thickness 6.25 mm is designed which givens more than -10 dB reflection loss from 4 to 18GHz of frequencies. Next, the effect of rivet installation on these RAS is carried out using three different rivet configurations. The RCS performance of RAS is evaluated for duct of different lengths from 1 to 18GHz of frequencies. In order to see the RCS performance, five different air intake cases are considered The RCS performance with increase in percentage surface area of rivet heads to RAS is reported in detail. At the last, an open-source aircraft CAD model is considered and the RCS performance of RAS air intake with and without rivets is evaluated.

Title: Confidence Based Asynchronous Integrated Communication and Localization Networks Using Pulsed UWB Signals
Authors: Fan Liu, Bofeng Zheng, Tingting Zhang, Qinyu Zhang
Abstract: In recent years, UWB has garnered widespread attention in academia and industry due to its low power consumption, wide bandwidth, and high time resolution characteristics. This paper introduces the design of an asynchronous IR-UWB integrated communication and localization (ICL) downlink network, which employs unified waveforms to enable simultaneous data transmission and localization. A differential sequential detection strategy has been proposed for data demodulation. To address errors caused by symbol misalignment, a novel symbol confidence metric model is introduced to ensure reliable pulse detection and time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation. Additionally, an asynchronous start-of-frame delimiter (SFD) detection model has been constructed to guide parameter optimization for practical applications. Furthermore, the clock drift estimation has been improved by leveraging the confidence metric within a modified weighted least squares (MWLS) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable clock drift estimation, communication, and self-localization simultaneously. The operational range of the confidence metric required for these outcomes is also quantified, providing valuable insights for parameter design and system implementation. Finally, the agent localization accuracy can be achieved within 10 cm at over 90\% confidence, with commercial UWB devices according to practical measurements.

Title: C2S-AE: CSI to Sensing enabled by an Auto-Encoder-based Framework
Authors: Jun Jiang, Shugong Xu, Wenjun Yu, Yuan Gao
Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks are set to utilize integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a critical technology, providing significant support for sectors like the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), extended reality (XR), and smart home applications. A key challenge in ISAC implementation is the extraction of sensing parameters from radio signals, a task that conventional methods struggle to achieve due to the complexity of acquiring sensing channel data. In this paper, we introduce a novel auto-encoder (AE)-based framework to acquire sensing information using channel state information (CSI). Specifically, our framework, termed C2S (CSI to sensing)-AE, learns the relationship between CSI and the delay power spectrum (DPS), from which the range information can be readily accessed. To validate our framework's performance, we conducted measurements of DPS and CSI in real-world scenarios and introduced the dataset 'SHU7'. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework excels in C2S extrapolation, surpassing existing methods in terms of accuracy for both delay and signal strength of individual paths. This innovative approach holds the potential to greatly enhance sensing capabilities in future mobile networks, paving the way for more robust and versatile ISAC applications.

Title: A Fully Self-Synchronized Control for Hybrid Series-Parallel Electronized Power Networks
Authors: Zexiong Wei, Yao Sun, Xiaochao Hou, Mei Su
Abstract: The hybrid series-parallel system is the final form of the power electronics-enabled power system, which combines the advantages of both series and parallel connections. Although self-synchronization of parallel-type and series-type systems is well known, self-synchronization of hybrid systems remains unrevealed. To fill in this gap, a fully self-synchronized control for hybrid series-parallel system is proposed in this paper. Based on the self-synchronization mechanism of power angle in parallel-type system and power factor angle in series-type system, a decentralized control strategy by integration of power droop and power factor angle droop can realize self-synchronization and power balancing of each module in the hybrid system.

Title: Cross Modality Medical Image Synthesis for Improving Liver Segmentation
Authors: Muhammad Rafiq, Hazrat Ali, Ghulam Mujtaba, Zubair Shah, Shoaib Azmat
Abstract: Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of medical images requires large datasets. However, the lack of large publicly available labeled datasets limits the development of deep learning-based CAD systems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in particular, CycleGAN, can be used to generate new cross-domain images without paired training data. However, most CycleGAN-based synthesis methods lack the potential to overcome alignment and asymmetry between the input and generated data. We propose a two-stage technique for the synthesis of abdominal MRI using cross-modality translation of abdominal CT. We show that the synthetic data can help improve the performance of the liver segmentation network. We increase the number of abdominal MRI images through cross-modality image transformation of unpaired CT images using a CycleGAN inspired deformation invariant network called EssNet. Subsequently, we combine the synthetic MRI images with the original MRI images and use them to improve the accuracy of the U-Net on a liver segmentation task. We train the U-Net on real MRI images and then on real and synthetic MRI images. Consequently, by comparing both scenarios, we achieve an improvement in the performance of U-Net. In summary, the improvement achieved in the Intersection over Union (IoU) is 1.17%. The results show potential to address the data scarcity challenge in medical imaging.

Title: An Efficient and Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning Framework for Quality Assurance in Extrusion Additive Manufacturing
Authors: Xiaohan Li, Sebastian Pattinson
Abstract: Defects in extrusion additive manufacturing remain common despite its prevalent use. While numerous AI-driven approaches have been proposed to improve quality assurance, the inherently dynamic nature of the printing process poses persistent challenges. Regardless of how comprehensive the training dataset is, out-of-distribution data remains inevitable. Consequently, deterministic models often struggle to maintain robustness and, in some cases, fail entirely when deployed in new or slightly altered printing environments. This work introduces an agent that dynamically adjusts flow rate and temperature setpoints in real time, optimizing process control while addressing bottlenecks in training efficiency and uncertainty management. It integrates a vision-based uncertainty quantification module with a reinforcement learning controller, using probabilistic distributions to describe printing segments. While the underlying networks are deterministic, these evolving distributions introduce adaptability into the decision-making process. The vision system classifies material extrusion with a certain level of precision, generating corresponding distributions. A deep Q-learning controller interacts with a simulated environment calibrated to the vision system precision, allowing the agent to learn optimal actions while demonstrating appropriate hesitation when necessary. By executing asynchronous actions and applying progressively tightened elliptical reward shaping, the controller develops robust, adaptive control strategies that account for the coupling effects between process parameters. When deployed with zero-shot learning, the agent effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, correcting mild and severe under- and over-extrusion reliably. Beyond extrusion additive manufacturing, this scalable framework enables practical AI-driven quality assurance across various additive manufacturing processes.

Title: RSSI Positioning with Fluid Antenna Systems
Authors: Wenzhi Liu, Zhisheng Rong, Xiayue Liu, Yufei Jiang, Xu Zhu
Abstract: We introduce a novel received signal strength intensity (RSSI)-based positioning method using fluid antenna systems (FAS), leveraging their inherent channel correlation properties to improve location accuracy. By enabling a single antenna to sample multiple spatial positions, FAS exhibits high correlation between its ports. We integrate this high inter-port correlation with a logarithmic path loss model to mitigate the impact of fast fading on RSSI signals, and derive a simplified multipoint positioning model based on the established relationship between channel correlation and RSSI signal correlation. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is then developed, for which we provide a closed-form solution. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both traditional least squares (LS) methods and single-antenna systems, achieving accuracy comparable to conventional multi-antenna positioning. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different antenna structures on positioning performance, offering practical guidance for FAS antenna design.

Title: Real-World Deployment and Assessment of a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Variable Speed Limit Control System
Authors: Yuhang Zhang, Zhiyao Zhang, Junyi Ji, Marcos Quiñones-Grueiro, William Barbour, Derek Gloudemans, Gergely Zachár, Clay Weston, Gautam Biswas, Daniel B. Work
Abstract: This article presents the first field deployment of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based variable speed limit (VSL) control system on Interstate 24 (I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee. We design and demonstrate a full pipeline from training MARL agents in a traffic simulator to a field deployment on a 17-mile segment of I-24 encompassing 67 VSL controllers. The system was launched on March 8th, 2024, and has made approximately 35 million decisions on 28 million trips in six months of operation. We apply an invalid action masking mechanism and several safety guards to ensure real-world constraints. The MARL-based implementation operates up to 98% of the time, with the safety guards overriding the MARL decisions for the remaining time. We evaluate the performance of the MARL-based algorithm in comparison to a previously deployed non-RL VSL benchmark algorithm on I-24.

Title: Unified Power Flow Model for Bipolar HVDC Grids in Unbalanced Operation
Authors: Chandra Kant Jat, Francesco Giacomo Puricelli, Jef Beerten, Hakan Ergun, Dirk Van Hertem
Abstract: In the near future, point-to-point High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems are expected to evolve into multi-terminal and meshed HVDC grids, predominantly adopting a bipolar HVDC configuration. Normally, bipolar HVDC systems operate in balanced mode, i.e., near zero current flows through metallic or ground return. However, bipolar HVDC systems can also be operated in an unbalanced mode in case of a single converter pole or line conductor outage. A steady-state analysis of the unbalanced DC network requires solving a power flow problem including various converter control modes, as the steady-state behavior of the converters is governed by their control modes. This paper presents a comprehensive and unified power flow model for the balanced and unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids, including various converter control modes on the AC and DC sides of the converter, in a hybrid AC/DC system. It extends the basic control modes, developed for monopolar HVDC grids, to support the balanced as well as unbalanced operation of bipolar HVDC grids. Additionally, an AC-droop control, which defines a droop relationship between voltage magnitude and reactive power at the AC side of the converter, is incorporated into the modeling of bipolar HVDC systems. The functionality of the proposed model is demonstrated through a test case, and the power flow results are validated using PSCAD simulations. The impact of converter control modes on post-contingency system states is also investigated for single-pole contingencies. The proposed model is implemented as an open-source tool in the Julia/JuMP framework, where larger test cases demonstrate the robustness of the model and tool.

Authors: Daniel Baker (Defense Sector, BlueHalo, LLC), Sean Phillips (Space Control Branch (RVSW), Air Force Research Laboratory)
Abstract: As autonomous systems are being developed in multiple industries it has been recognized that a phased approach is needed both for technical development and user acceptance. Partially in response, the automotive and aircraft industries have published five or six Levels of Autonomy in an attempt to broadly characterize the amount of autonomy technology that is present in any particular vehicle. We propose six Spacecraft Autonomy Levels to characterize and describe the high-level autonomous capabilities for any given satellite. Our proposed spacecraft autonomy levels parallel those of the automotive and aircraft levels in an attempt to maintain consistency and a common understanding. We see these autonomy levels as useful in education and communication with lawmakers, government officials, and the general public.

Title: Tackling Hallucination from Conditional Models for Medical Image Reconstruction with DynamicDPS
Authors: Seunghoi Kim, Henry F. J. Tregidgo, Matteo Figini, Chen Jin, Sarang Joshi, Daniel C. Alexander
Abstract: Hallucinations are spurious structures not present in the ground truth, posing a critical challenge in medical image reconstruction, especially for data-driven conditional models. We hypothesize that combining an unconditional diffusion model with data consistency, trained on a diverse dataset, can reduce these hallucinations. Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based framework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to enhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing hallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a conditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse problem solver. DynamicDPS skips early stage in the reverse process by selecting an optimal starting time point per sample and applies Wolfe's line search for adaptive step sizes, improving both efficiency and image fidelity. Using diffusion priors and data consistency, our method effectively reduces hallucinations from any conditional model output. We validate its effectiveness in Image Quality Transfer for low-field MRI enhancement. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real MR scans, including a downstream task for tissue volume estimation, show that DynamicDPS reduces hallucinations, improving relative volume estimation by over 15% for critical tissues while using only 5% of the sampling steps required by baseline diffusion models. As a model-agnostic and fine-tuning-free approach, DynamicDPS offers a robust solution for hallucination reduction in medical imaging. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Title: Graph-Based Dynamics and Network Control of a Single Articulated Robotic System
Authors: Jonathan Lane, Nak-seung Patrick Hyun
Abstract: Extensive research on graph-based dynamics and control of multi-agent systems has successfully demonstrated control of robotic swarms, where each robot is perceived as an independent agent virtually connected by a network topology. The strong advantage of the network control structure lies in the decentralized nature of the control action, which only requires the knowledge of virtually connected agents. In this paper, we seek to expand the ideas of virtual network constraints to physical constraints on a class of tree-structured robots which we denote as single articulated robotic (SAR) systems. In our proposed framework, each link can be viewed as an agent, and each holonomic constraint connecting links serves as an edge. By following the first principles of Lagrangian dynamics, we derive a consensus-like matrix-differential equation with weighted graph and edge Laplacians for the dynamics of a SAR system. The sufficient condition for the holonomic constraint forces becoming independent to the control inputs is derived. This condition leads to a decentralized leader-follower network control framework for regulating the relative configuration of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Title: Large AI Model for Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Prediction in 6G OTFS-Based Vehicular Networks
Authors: Jianzhe Xue, Dongcheng Yuan, Zhanxi Ma, Tiankai Jiang, Yu Sun, Haibo Zhou, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: Channel prediction is crucial for high-mobility vehicular networks, as it enables the anticipation of future channel conditions and the proactive adjustment of communication strategies. However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.

Title: Velocity-Aware Statistical Analysis of Peak AoI for Ground and Aerial Users
Authors: Yujie Qin, Mustafa A. Kishk, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to analyze the impact of user velocity on the distribution of the peak age-of-information (PAoI) for both ground and aerial users by using the dominant interferer-based approximation. We first approximate the SINR meta distribution for the uplink transmission using the distances between the serving base station (BS) and each of the user of interest and the dominant interfering user, which is the interferer that provides the strongest average received power at the tagged BS. We then analyze the spatio-temporal correlation coefficient of the conditional success probability by studying the correlation between the aforementioned two distances. Finally, we choose PAoI as a performance metric to showcase how spatio-temporal correlation or user velocity affect system performance. Our results reveal that ground users exhibit higher spatio-temporal correlations compared to aerial users, resulting in a more pronounced impact of velocity on system performance, such as joint probability of the conditional success probability and distribution of PAoI. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the dominant interferer-based approximation for the SINR meta distribution delivers good matching performance in complex scenarios, such as Nakagami-m fading model, and it can also be effectively utilized in computing spatio-temporal correlation, as this approximation is derived from the distances to the serving BS and the dominant interferer.

Title: DiffRhythm: Blazingly Fast and Embarrassingly Simple End-to-End Full-Length Song Generation with Latent Diffusion
Authors: Ziqian Ning, Huakang Chen, Yuepeng Jiang, Chunbo Hao, Guobin Ma, Shuai Wang, Jixun Yao, Lei Xie
Abstract: Recent advancements in music generation have garnered significant attention, yet existing approaches face critical limitations. Some current generative models can only synthesize either the vocal track or the accompaniment track. While some models can generate combined vocal and accompaniment, they typically rely on meticulously designed multi-stage cascading architectures and intricate data pipelines, hindering scalability. Additionally, most systems are restricted to generating short musical segments rather than full-length songs. Furthermore, widely used language model-based methods suffer from slow inference speeds. To address these challenges, we propose DiffRhythm, the first latent diffusion-based song generation model capable of synthesizing complete songs with both vocal and accompaniment for durations of up to 4m45s in only ten seconds, maintaining high musicality and intelligibility. Despite its remarkable capabilities, DiffRhythm is designed to be simple and elegant: it eliminates the need for complex data preparation, employs a straightforward model structure, and requires only lyrics and a style prompt during inference. Additionally, its non-autoregressive structure ensures fast inference speeds. This simplicity guarantees the scalability of DiffRhythm. Moreover, we release the complete training code along with the pre-trained model on large-scale data to promote reproducibility and further research.

Authors: S. Chen, D. Ma, M. Raviselvan, S. Sundaramoorthy, K. Popuri, M. J. Ju, M. V. Sarunic, D. Ratra, M. F. Beg
Abstract: This study presents an AI-driven pipeline for automated retinal segmentation and thickness analysis in diabetic retinopathy (DR) using SD-OCT imaging. A deep neural network was trained to segment ten retinal layers, intra-retinal fluid, and hyperreflective foci (HRF), with performance evaluated across multiple architectures. SwinUNETR achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, while VM-Unet excelled in specific layers. Analysis revealed distinct thickness variations between NPDR and PDR, with correlations between layer thickness and visual acuity. The proposed method enhances DR assessment by reducing manual annotation effort and providing clinically relevant thickness maps for disease monitoring and treatment planning.

Title: Interactive Gadolinium-Free MRI Synthesis: A Transformer with Localization Prompt Learning
Authors: Linhao Li, Changhui Su, Yu Guo, Huimao Zhang, Dong Liang, Kun Shang
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is crucial for tumor detection and diagnosis, but the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in clinical settings raises safety concerns due to potential health risks. To circumvent these issues while preserving diagnostic accuracy, we propose a novel Transformer with Localization Prompts (TLP) framework for synthesizing CE-MRI from non-contrast MR images. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: a hierarchical backbone that uses efficient Transformer to process multi-scale features; a multi-stage fusion system consisting of Local and Global Fusion modules that hierarchically integrate complementary information via spatial attention operations and cross-attention mechanisms, respectively; and a Fuzzy Prompt Generation (FPG) module that enhances the TLP model's generalization by emulating radiologists' manual annotation through stochastic feature perturbation. The framework uniquely enables interactive clinical integration by allowing radiologists to input diagnostic prompts during inference, synergizing artificial intelligence with medical expertise. This research establishes a new paradigm for contrast-free MRI synthesis while addressing critical clinical needs for safer diagnostic procedures. Codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM
Authors: Lapo Frascati, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.

Title: Stability Analysis and Intervention Strategies on a Coupled SIS Epidemic Model with Polar Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Qiulin Xu, Tatsuya Masada, Hideaki Ishii
Abstract: This paper investigates the spread of infectious diseases within a networked community by integrating epidemic transmission and public opinion dynamics. We propose a novel discrete-time networked SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) epidemic model coupled with opinion dynamics that includes stubborn agents with biased views. The model captures the interplay between perceived and actual epidemic severity, offering insights into epidemic dynamics in socially interconnected environments. We introduce the SIS-opinion reproduction number to assess epidemic severity and analyze conditions for disease eradication and the global stability of endemic equilibria. Additionally, we explore opinion-based intervention strategies, providing a framework for policymakers to design effective prevention measures. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings and the model's practical implications.

Title: Surface Topography as an Energy State: Hamiltonian Description of Functional Properties in Phase Space and Quantification via Optical Methods
Authors: Boris Brodmann, Matthias Eifler
Abstract: The assessment of tribological processes necessitates comprehensive monitoring and interpretation of surface states, traditionally by topography height values and surface texture parameters. This paper proposes a phase space representation as generic interpretation of surfaces to enhance tribological assessments. By deriving distinctions between two-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds from phenomenological thermodynamics, we demonstrate the existence of fractal dimensions on physical surfaces. Utilizing the smallest representable wavelength, a coordinate ensemble where each coordinate has a generalized degree of freedom and a differential amount across fractal dimensions is proposed. The metric is interpreted as a time coordinate, allowing the derivative to be seen as velocity. Through geometric dimension analysis, we derive a topographic Hamiltonian via generalized momentum. Each coordinate pair in the ensemble is assigned a location in phase space. Statistical considerations define a symplectic structure and phase space volume. As a use-case, a two-disc experiment demonstrates that topography changes under load can be understood as a self-organization process through thermodynamic reasoning. As a possibility for a direct assessment of the phase space of a surface for monitoring tribological processes, we propose the combination of topographic measuring systems with scattering light measurement. This multi sensor approach offers opportunities for optimizing performance in tribological applications.

Title: From Claims to Evidence: A Unified Framework and Critical Analysis of CNN vs. Transformer vs. Mamba in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj, Giovanni Baj, Yazdan Salimi, Anselm W. Stark, Waldo Valenzuela, George CM. Siontis, Habib Zaidi, Mauricio Reyes, Christoph Graeni, Isaac Shiri
Abstract: While numerous architectures for medical image segmentation have been proposed, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art models networks such as nnUNet, still leave room for further innovation. In this work, we introduce nnUZoo, an open source benchmarking framework built upon nnUNet, which incorporates various deep learning architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, and Mamba-based models. Using this framework, we provide a fair comparison to demystify performance claims across different medical image segmentation tasks. Additionally, in an effort to enrich the benchmarking, we explored five new architectures based on Mamba and Transformers, collectively named X2Net, and integrated them into nnUZoo for further evaluation. The proposed models combine the features of conventional U2Net, nnUNet, CNN, Transformer, and Mamba layers and architectures, called X2Net (UNETR2Net (UNETR), SwT2Net (SwinTransformer), SS2D2Net (SwinUMamba), Alt1DM2Net (LightUMamba), and MambaND2Net (MambaND)). We extensively evaluate the performance of different models on six diverse medical image segmentation datasets, including microscopy, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET, covering various body parts, organs, and labels. We compare their performance, in terms of dice score and computational efficiency, against their baseline models, U2Net, and nnUNet. CNN models like nnUNet and U2Net demonstrated both speed and accuracy, making them effective choices for medical image segmentation tasks. Transformer-based models, while promising for certain imaging modalities, exhibited high computational costs. Proposed Mamba-based X2Net architecture (SS2D2Net) achieved competitive accuracy with no significantly difference from nnUNet and U2Net, while using fewer parameters. However, they required significantly longer training time, highlighting a trade-off between model efficiency and computational cost.

Title: ecg2o: A Seamless Extension of g2o for Equality-Constrained Factor Graph Optimization
Authors: Anas Abdelkarim, Holger Voos, Daniel Görges
Abstract: Factor graph optimization serves as a fundamental framework for robotic perception, enabling applications such as pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure-from-motion (SfM), and situational awareness. Traditionally, these methods solve unconstrained least squares problems using algorithms such as Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt. However, extending factor graphs with native support for equality constraints can improve solution accuracy and broaden their applicability, particularly in optimal control. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of factor graphs that seamlessly incorporates equality constraints without requiring additional optimization algorithms. Our approach maintains the efficiency and flexibility of existing second-order optimization techniques while ensuring constraint feasibility. To validate our method, we apply it to an optimal control problem for velocity tracking in autonomous vehicles and benchmark our results against state-of-the-art constraint handling techniques. Additionally, we introduce ecg2o, a header-only C++ library that extends the widely used g2o factor graph library by adding full support for equality-constrained optimization. This library, along with demonstrative examples and the optimal control problem, is available as open source at this https URL

Title: Hierarchically Tunable 6DMA for Wireless Communication and Sensing: Modeling and Performance Optimization
Authors: Haocheng Hua, Yuyan Zhou, Weidong Mei, Jie Xu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: This paper proposes a new hierarchically tunable six-dimensional movable antenna (HT-6DMA) architecture for base station (BS) in future wireless networks. The HT-6DMA BS consists of multiple antenna arrays that can flexibly move on a spherical surface, with their three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations/orientations efficiently characterized in the global spherical coordinate system (SCS) and their individual local SCSs, respectively. As a result, the 6DMA system is hierarchically tunable in the sense that each array's global position and local rotation can be separately adjusted in a sequential manner with the other being fixed, thus greatly reducing their design complexity and improving the achievable performance. In particular, we consider an HT-6DMA BS serving multiple single-antenna users in the uplink communication or sensing potential unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones in a given airway area. Specifically, for the communication scenario, we aim to maximize the average sum rate of communication users in the long term by optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMA arrays at the BS. While for the airway sensing scenario, we maximize the minimum received sensing signal power along the airway by optimizing the 6DMA arrays' positions and rotations along with the BS's transmit covariance matrix. Despite that the formulated problems are both non-convex, we propose efficient solutions to them by exploiting the hierarchical tunability of positions/rotations of 6DMA arrays in our proposed model. Numerical results show that the proposed HT-6DMA design significantly outperforms not only the traditional BS with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), but also the existing 6DMA scheme. Furthermore, it is unveiled that the performance gains of HT-6DMA mostly come from the arrays' global position adjustments on the spherical surface, rather than their local rotation adjustments.

Title: Local Rational Modeling for Identification Beyond the Nyquist Frequency: Applied to a Prototype Wafer Stage
Authors: Max van Haren, Lennart Blanken, Koen Classens, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Fast-rate models are essential for control design, specifically to address intersample behavior. The aim of this paper is to develop a frequency-domain non-parametric identification technique to estimate fast-rate models of systems that have relevant dynamics and allow for actuation above the Nyquist frequency of a slow-rate output. Examples of such systems include vision-in-the-loop systems. Through local rational models over multiple frequency bands, aliased components are effectively disentangled, particularly for lightly-damped systems. The developed technique accurately determines non-parametric fast-rate models of systems with slow-rate outputs, all within a single identification experiment. Finally, the effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through experiments conducted on a prototype wafer stage used for semiconductor manufacturing.

Title: Diffusion-based Virtual Staining from Polarimetric Mueller Matrix Imaging
Authors: Xiaoyu Zheng, Jing Wen, Jiaxin Zhuang, Yao Du, Jing Cong, Limei Guo, Chao He, Lin Luo, Hao Chen
Abstract: Polarization, as a new optical imaging tool, has been explored to assist in the diagnosis of pathology. Moreover, converting the polarimetric Mueller Matrix (MM) to standardized stained images becomes a promising approach to help pathologists interpret the results. However, existing methods for polarization-based virtual staining are still in the early stage, and the diffusion-based model, which has shown great potential in enhancing the fidelity of the generated images, has not been studied yet. In this paper, a Regulated Bridge Diffusion Model (RBDM) for polarization-based virtual staining is proposed. RBDM utilizes the bidirectional bridge diffusion process to learn the mapping from polarization images to other modalities such as H\&E and fluorescence. And to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct the experiment on our manually collected dataset, which consists of 18,000 paired polarization, fluorescence and H\&E images, due to the unavailability of the public dataset. The experiment results show that our model greatly outperforms other benchmark methods. Our dataset and code will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Hybrid MIMO in the Upper Mid-Band: Architectures, Processing, and Energy Efficiency
Authors: Marouan Mizmizi, Ahmed Alkhateeb, Umberto Spagnolini
Abstract: As 6G networks evolve, the upper mid-band spectrum (7 GHz to 24 GHz), or frequency range 3 (FR3), is emerging as a promising balance between the coverage offered by sub-6 GHz bands and the high-capacity of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. This paper explores the structure of FR3 hybrid MIMO systems and proposes two architectural classes: Frequency Integrated (FI) and Frequency Partitioned (FP). FI architectures enhance spectral efficiency by exploiting multiple sub-bands parallelism, while FP architectures dynamically allocate sub-band access according to specific application requirements. Additionally, two approaches, fully digital (FD) and hybrid analog-digital (HAD), are considered, comparing shared (SRF) versus dedicated RF (DRF) chain configurations. Herein signal processing solutions are investigated, particularly for an uplink multi-user scenario with power control optimization. Results demonstrate that SRF and DRF architectures achieve comparable spectral efficiency; however, SRF structures consume nearly half the power of DRF in the considered setup. While FD architectures provide higher spectral efficiency, they do so at the cost of increased power consumption compared to HAD. Additionally, FI architectures show slightly greater power consumption compared to FP; however, they provide a significant benefit in spectral efficiency (over 4 x), emphasizing an important trade-off in FR3 engineering.

Title: Channel Semantic Characterization for Integrated Sensing and Communication Scenarios: From Measurements to Modeling
Authors: Zhengyu Zhang, Ruisi He, Bo Ai, Mi Yang, Xuejian Zhang, Ziyi Qi, Zhangdui Zhong
Abstract: With the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is crucial for perceiving and interacting with the environment via electromagnetic propagation, termed channel semantics, to support tasks like decision-making. However, channel models focusing on physical characteristics face challenges in representing semantics embedded in the channel, thereby limiting the evaluation of ISAC systems. To tackle this, we present a novel framework for channel modeling from the conceptual event perspective. By leveraging a multi-level semantic structure and characterized knowledge libraries, the framework decomposes complex channel characteristics into extensible semantic characterization, thereby better capturing the relationship between environment and channel, and enabling more flexible adjustments of channel models for different events without requiring a complete reset. Specifically, we define channel semantics on three levels: status semantics, behavior semantics, and event semantics, corresponding to channel multipaths, channel time-varying trajectories, and channel topology, respectively. Taking realistic vehicular ISAC scenarios as an example, we perform semantic clustering, characterizing status semantics via multipath statistical distributions, modeling behavior semantics using Markov chains for time variation, and representing event semantics through a co-occurrence matrix. Results show the model accurately generates channels while capturing rich semantic information. Moreover, its generalization supports customized semantics.

Title: Transferring between sparse and dense matching via probabilistic reweighting
Authors: Ya Fan, Rongling Lang
Abstract: Detector-based and detector-free matchers are only applicable within their respective sparsity ranges. To improve adaptability of existing matchers, this paper introduces a novel probabilistic reweighting method. Our method is applicable to Transformer-based matching networks and adapts them to different sparsity levels without altering network parameters. The reweighting approach adjusts attention weights and matching scores using detection probabilities of features. And we prove that the reweighted matching network is the asymptotic limit of detector-based matching network. Furthermore, we propose a sparse training and pruning pipeline for detector-free networks based on reweighting. Reweighted versions of SuperGlue, LightGlue, and LoFTR are implemented and evaluated across different levels of sparsity. Experiments show that the reweighting method improves pose accuracy of detector-based matchers on dense features. And the performance of reweighted sparse LoFTR is comparable to detector-based matchers, demonstrating good flexibility in balancing accuracy and computational complexity.

Title: Trajectory Planning with Signal Temporal Logic Costs using Deterministic Path Integral Optimization
Authors: Patrick Halder, Hannes Homburger, Lothar Kiltz, Johannes Reuter, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: Formulating the intended behavior of a dynamic system can be challenging. Signal temporal logic (STL) is frequently used for this purpose due to its suitability in formalizing comprehensible, modular, and versatile spatiotemporal specifications. Due to scaling issues with respect to the complexity of the specifications and the potential occurrence of non-differentiable terms, classical optimization methods often solve STL-based problems inefficiently. Smoothing and approximation techniques can alleviate these issues but require changing the optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel sampling-based method based on model predictive path integral control to solve optimal control problems with STL cost functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark motion planning problems and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method efficiently solves optimal control problems with STL costs.

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.

Title: Patterning Silver Nanowire Network via the Gibbs-Thomson Effect
Authors: Hongteng Wang, Haichuan Li, Yijia Xin, Weizhen Chen, Haogen Liu, Ying Chen, Yaofei Chen, Lei Chen, Yunhan Luo, Zhe Chen, Gui-Shi Liu
Abstract: As transparent electrodes, patterned silver nanowire (AgNW) networks suffer from noticeable pattern visibility, which is an unsettled issue for practical applications such as display. Here, we introduce a Gibbs-Thomson effect (GTE)-based patterning method to effectively reduce pattern visibility. Unlike conventional top-down and bottom-up strategies that rely on selective etching, removal, or deposition of AgNWs, our approach focuses on fragmenting nanowires primarily at the junctions through the GTE. This is realized by modifying AgNWs with a compound of diphenyliodonium nitrate and silver nitrate, which aggregates into nanoparticles at the junctions of AgNWs. These nanoparticles can boost the fragmentation of nanowires at the junctions under an ultralow temperature (75°C), allow pattern transfer through a photolithographic masking operation, and enhance plasmonic welding during UV exposure. The resultant patterned electrodes have trivial differences in transmittance ({\Delta}T = 1.4%) and haze ({\Delta}H = 0.3%) between conductive and insulative regions, with high-resolution patterning size down to 10 {\mu}m. To demonstrate the practicality of this novel method, we constructed a highly transparent, optoelectrical interactive tactile e-skin using the patterned AgNW electrodes.

Title: Metering Error Estimation of Fast-Charging Stations Using Charging Data Analytics
Authors: Kang Ma, Xiulan Liu, Xi Chen, Xiaohu Liu, Wei Zhao, Lisha Peng, Songling Huang, Shisong Li
Abstract: Accurate electric energy metering (EEM) of fast charging stations (FCSs), serving as critical infrastructure in the electric vehicle (EV) industry and as significant carriers of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, is the cornerstone for ensuring fair electric energy transactions. Traditional on-site verification methods, constrained by their high costs and low efficiency, struggle to keep pace with the rapid global expansion of FCSs. In response, this paper adopts a data-driven approach and proposes the measuring performance comparison (MPC) method. By utilizing the estimation value of state-of-charge (SOC) as a medium, MPC establishes comparison chains of EEM performance of multiple FCSs. Therefore, the estimation of EEM errors for FCSs with high efficiency is enabled. Moreover, this paper summarizes the interfering factors of estimation results and establishes corresponding error models and uncertainty models. Also, a method for discriminating whether there are EEM performance defects in FCSs is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of MPC method is validated, with results indicating that for FCSs with an accuracy grade of 2\%, the discriminative accuracy exceeds 95\%. The MPC provides a viable approach for the online monitoring of EEM performance for FCSs, laying a foundation for a fair and just electricity trading market.

Title: An Efficient Approach to Detecting Lung Nodules Using Swin Transformer
Authors: Saeed Shakuri, Alireza Rezvanian
Abstract: Lung cancer has the highest rate of cancer-caused deaths, and early-stage diagnosis could increase the survival rate. Lung nodules are common indicators of lung cancer, making their detection crucial. Various lung nodule detection models exist, but many lack efficiency. Hence, we propose a more efficient approach by leveraging 2D CT slices, reducing computational load and complexity in training and inference. We employ the tiny version of Swin Transformer to benefit from Vision Transformers (ViT) while maintaining low computational cost. A Feature Pyramid Network is added to enhance detection, particularly for small nodules. Additionally, Transfer Learning is used to accelerate training. Our experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher mAP and mAR for small nodules by 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Overall, our model achieves the highest mAP of 94.7% and mAR of 94.9%.

Title: M-SCAN: A Multistage Framework for Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis Grading Using Multi-View Cross Attention
Authors: Arnesh Batra, Arush Gumber, Anushk Kumar
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of lumbar spinal canal stenosis has resulted in a surge of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), leading to labor-intensive interpretation and significant inter-reader variability, even among expert radiologists. This paper introduces a novel and efficient deep-learning framework that fully automates the grading of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in grading spinal canal stenosis on a dataset of 1,975 unique studies, each containing three distinct types of 3D cross-sectional spine images: Axial T2, Sagittal T1, and Sagittal T2/STIR. Employing a distinctive training strategy, our proposed multistage approach effectively integrates sagittal and axial images. This strategy employs a multi-view model with a sequence-based architecture, optimizing feature extraction and cross-view alignment to achieve an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.971 in spinal canal stenosis grading surpassing other state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Uplink Transmission Design for Fluid Antenna-Enabled Multiuser MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI
Authors: Linyue Hu, Luchu Li, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren
Abstract: This paper investigates a two-timescale uplink transmission framework for a fluid antenna-enabled multiuser multi-input multi-output system (MIMO-FAS). Antenna positions are optimized based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) adapt to instantaneous CSI. Under a Rician fading channel with imperfect CSI, we establish a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation approach and derive a closed-form expression for the achievable uplink rate using a low-complexity maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) detector. The optimization problem is formulated as a minimum user rate maximization problem by optimizing the fluid antenna positions, subject to the feasible region and the minimum spacing distance constraints. To address this non-convex problem, a genetic algorithm (GA) method is proposed, encoding antenna configurations as population individuals. Additionally, an accelerated gradient ascent algorithm is proposed to enhance computational efficiency. Numerical results validate the mathematical derivations and demonstrate that the proposed two-timescale transmission strategy significantly outperforms traditional FPA systems, with both algorithms achieving enhanced gains.

Title: A Lagrangian-Informed Long-Term Dispatch Policy for Coupled Hydropower and Photovoltaic Systems
Authors: Eliza Cohn, Ning Qi, Upmanu Lall, Bolun Xu
Abstract: This paper presents a long-term dispatch framework for coupled hydropower and floating photovoltaic systems. We introduce a temporal decomposition algorithm based on partial Lagrangian relaxation to address long-term water contract constraints. We derive a real-time, non-anticipatory dispatch policy based on water contract pricing. Our framework is evaluated with a case study using real-world hydrology and power system data from Lake Mead and Lake Powell, on the Colorado River, demonstrating competitive performance against commercial solvers for both linearized and nonlinear reservoir models. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on transmission capacity, electricity price and uncertainty scenarios, showing that the operational performance is significantly impacted by the transmission capacity and electricity prices while remaining relatively robust under uncertainty scenarios.

Title: Secrecy Rate Maximization for 6G Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces Assisted Systems
Authors: Chandan Kumar Sheemar, Wali Ullah Khan, Marco di Renzo, Asad Mahmood, Jorge Querol, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) have emerged as a transformative material technology, enabling dynamic control of electromagnetic waves to generate versatile holographic beam patterns. This paper addresses the problem of secrecy rate maximization for an RHS-assisted systems by joint designing the digital beamforming, artificial noise (AN), and the analog holographic beamforming. However, such a problem results to be non-convex and challenging. Therefore, to solve it, a novel alternating optimization algorithm based on the majorization-maximization (MM) framework for RHS-assisted systems is proposed, which rely on surrogate functions to facilitate efficient and reliable optimization. In the proposed approach, digital beamforming design ensures directed signal power toward the legitimate user while minimizing leakage to the unintended receiver. The AN generation method projects noise into the null space of the legitimate user channel, aligning it with the unintended receiver channel to degrade its signal quality. Finally, the holographic beamforming weights are optimized to refine the wavefronts for enhanced secrecy rate performance Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in secrecy rate compared to the benchmark method.

Title: An Analysis of Segment Anything 2
Authors: Clayton Bromley, Alexander Moore, Amar Saini, Doug Poland, Carmen Carrano
Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a critical task in the development of video perception and understanding. The Segment-Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), released by Meta AI, is the current state-of-the-art architecture for end-to-end VOS. SAM 2 performs very well on both clean video data and augmented data, and completely intelligent video perception requires an understanding of how this architecture is capable of achieving such quality results. To better understand how each step within the SAM 2 architecture permits high-quality video segmentation, we pass a variety of complex video transformations through the architecture and measure the impact at each stage of the process. We observe that each progressive stage enables the filtering of complex transformation noise and the emphasis of the object of interest. Our contributions include the creation of complex transformation video datasets, an analysis of how each stage of the SAM 2 architecture interprets these transformations, and visualizations of segmented objects through each stage. By better understanding how each model structure impacts overall video understanding, VOS development can work to improve real-world applicability and performance tracking, localizing, and segmenting objects despite complex cluttered scenes and obscurations.

Title: Advanced YOLO-based Real-time Power Line Detection for Vegetation Management
Authors: Shuaiang Rong, Lina He, Salih Furkan Atici, Ahmet Enis Cetin
Abstract: Power line infrastructure is a key component of the power system, and it is rapidly expanding to meet growing energy demands. Vegetation encroachment is a significant threat to the safe operation of power lines, requiring reliable and timely management to enhance the resilience and reliability of the power network. Integrating smart grid technology, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), provides substantial potential to revolutionize the management of extensive power line networks with advanced imaging techniques. However, processing the vast quantity of images captured by UAV patrols remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces an intelligent real-time monitoring framework for detecting power lines and adjacent vegetation. It is developed based on the deep-learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), You Only Look Once (YOLO), renowned for its high-speed object detection capabilities. Unlike existing deep learning-based methods, this framework enhances accuracy by integrating YOLOv8 with directional filters. They can extract directional features and textures of power lines and their vicinity, generating Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) for more precise localization. Additionally, a post-processing algorithm is developed to create a vegetation encroachment metric for power lines, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the surrounding vegetation distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a widely used power line dataset.

Title: Stability Analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Inspection in a Terrestrial Testbed
Authors: Henry Lei, Zachary S. Lippay, Anonto Zaman, Joshua Aurand, Amin Maghareh, Sean Phillips
Abstract: The design and deployment of autonomous systems for space missions require robust solutions to navigate strict reliability constraints, extended operational duration, and communication challenges. This study evaluates the stability and performance of a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework designed for multi-agent satellite inspection tasks. The proposed framework integrates a high-level guidance policy with a low-level motion controller, enabling scalable task allocation and efficient trajectory execution. Experiments conducted on the Local Intelligent Network of Collaborative Satellites (LINCS) testbed assess the framework's performance under varying levels of fidelity, from simulated environments to a cyber-physical testbed. Key metrics, including task completion rate, distance traveled, and fuel consumption, highlight the framework's robustness and adaptability despite real-world uncertainties such as sensor noise, dynamic perturbations, and runtime assurance (RTA) constraints. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical controller effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, maintaining high task completion rates while adapting to the complexities of real-world environments. These findings validate the framework's potential for enabling autonomous satellite operations in future space missions.

Title: Data Taxonomy Towards the Applicability of the Digital Twin Conceptual Framework in Disaster Management
Authors: Eva Brucherseifer, Marco Marquard, Martin Hellmann, Andrea Tundis
Abstract: The Digital Twin (DT) offers a novel approach to the management of critical infrastructures, including energy, water, traffic, public health, and communication systems, which are indispensable for the functioning of modern societies. The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of these infrastructures necessitate the development of robust disaster response and management strategies. During crises and disasters, data source availability for critical infrastructure may be severely constrained due to physical damage to communication networks, power outages, overwhelmed systems, sensor failure or intentional disruptions, hampering the ability to effectively monitor, manage, and respond to emergencies. This research introduces a taxonomy and similarity function for comparing data sources based on their features and vulnerability to crisis events. This assessment enables the identification of similar, complementary, and alternative data sources and rapid adaptation when primary sources fail. The paper outlines a data source manager as an additional component for existing DT frameworks, specifically the data ingress and scenario mangement. A case study for traffic data sources in an urban scenario demonstrates the proposed methodology and its effectiveness. This approach enhances the robustness and adaptability of DTs in disaster management applications, contributing to improved decision-making and response capabilities in critical situations.

Title: InspireMusic: Integrating Super Resolution and Large Language Model for High-Fidelity Long-Form Music Generation
Authors: Chong Zhang, Yukun Ma, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Shengkui Zhao, Zexu Pan, Hao Wang, Chongjia Ni, Trung Hieu Nguyen, Kun Zhou, Yidi Jiang, Chaohong Tan, Zhifu Gao, Zhihao Du, Bin Ma
Abstract: We introduce InspireMusic, a framework integrated super resolution and large language model for high-fidelity long-form music generation. A unified framework generates high-fidelity music, songs, and audio, which incorporates an autoregressive transformer with a super-resolution flow-matching model. This framework enables the controllable generation of high-fidelity long-form music at a higher sampling rate from both text and audio prompts. Our model differs from previous approaches, as we utilize an audio tokenizer with one codebook that contains richer semantic information, thereby reducing training costs and enhancing efficiency. This combination enables us to achieve high-quality audio generation with long-form coherence of up to $8$ minutes. Then, an autoregressive transformer model based on Qwen 2.5 predicts audio tokens. Next, we employ a super-resolution flow-matching model to generate high-sampling rate audio with fine-grained details learned from an acoustic codec model. Comprehensive experiments show that the InspireMusic-1.5B-Long model has a comparable performance to recent top-tier open-source systems, including MusicGen and Stable Audio 2.0, on subjective and objective evaluations. The code and pre-trained models are released at this https URL.

Title: Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions
Authors: Aakash Patel, Tianqing Zhang, Camille Avestruz, Jeffrey Regier, the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.

Title: ProDapt: Proprioceptive Adaptation using Long-term Memory Diffusion
Authors: Federico Pizarro Bejarano, Bryson Jones, Daniel Pastor Moreno, Joseph Bowkett, Paul G. Backes, Angela P. Schoellig
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized imitation learning, allowing robots to replicate complex behaviours. However, diffusion often relies on cameras and other exteroceptive sensors to observe the environment and lacks long-term memory. In space, military, and underwater applications, robots must be highly robust to failures in exteroceptive sensors, operating using only proprioceptive information. In this paper, we propose ProDapt, a method of incorporating long-term memory of previous contacts between the robot and the environment in the diffusion process, allowing it to complete tasks using only proprioceptive data. This is achieved by identifying "keypoints", essential past observations maintained as inputs to the policy. We test our approach using a UR10e robotic arm in both simulation and real experiments and demonstrate the necessity of this long-term memory for task completion.

Title: Foundation-Model-Boosted Multimodal Learning for fMRI-based Neuropathic Pain Drug Response Prediction
Authors: Wenrui Fan, L. M. Riza Rizky, Jiayang Zhang, Chen Chen, Haiping Lu, Kevin Teh, Dinesh Selvarajah, Shuo Zhou
Abstract: Neuropathic pain, affecting up to 10% of adults, remains difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.

Title: Backstepping Control Laws for Higher-Dimensional PDEs: Spatial Invariance and Domain Extension Methods
Authors: Rafael Vazquez
Abstract: This paper extends backstepping to higher-dimensional PDEs by leveraging domain symmetries and structural properties. We systematically address three increasingly complex scenarios. First, for rectangular domains, we characterize boundary stabilization with finite-dimensional actuation by combining backstepping with Fourier analysis, deriving explicit necessary conditions. Second, for reaction-diffusion equations on sector domains, we use angular eigenfunction expansions to obtain kernel solutions in terms of modified Bessel functions. Finally, we outline a domain extension method for irregular domains, transforming the boundary control problem into an equivalent one on a target domain. This framework unifies and extends previous backstepping results, offering new tools for higher-dimensional domains where classical separation of variables is inapplicable.

Title: QaSAL: QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithms for Coexistence of 5G NR-U/Wi-Fi
Authors: Mohammad Reza Fasihi, Brian L. Mark
Abstract: With the increasing demand for wireless connectivity, ensuring the efficient coexistence of multiple radio access technologies in shared unlicensed spectrum has become an important issue. This paper focuses on optimizing Medium Access Control (MAC) parameters to enhance the coexistence of 5G New Radio in Unlicensed Spectrum (NR-U) and Wi-Fi networks operating in unlicensed spectrum with multiple priority classes of traffic that may have varying quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this context, we tackle the coexistence parameter management problem by introducing a QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable (QaSAL) framework, designed to improve network performance under various traffic conditions. Our approach augments the state representation with constraint information, enabling dynamic policy adjustments to enforce QoS requirements effectively. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of QaSAL in managing NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence, demonstrating improved channel access fairness while satisfying a latency constraint for high-priority traffic.

Title: Flow Matching for Medical Image Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Speed and Quality
Authors: Milad Yazdani, Yasamin Medghalchi, Pooria Ashrafian, Ilker Hacihaliloglu, Dena Shahriari
Abstract: Deep learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for various medical applications. However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications. Code with checkpoints and a synthetic dataset (beneficial for classification and segmentation) is now available on: this https URL.

Title: Energy-Efficient Edge Inference in Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation Networks
Authors: Jiacheng Yao, Wei Xu, Guangxu Zhu, Kaibin Huang, Shuguang Cui
Abstract: Task-oriented integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) is a key technology for achieving low-latency edge inference and enabling efficient implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the constrained energy supply at edge devices has emerged as a critical bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient ISCC framework for AI inference at resource-constrained edge devices, where adjustable split inference, model pruning, and feature quantization are jointly designed to adapt to diverse task requirements. A joint resource allocation design problem for the proposed ISCC framework is formulated to minimize the energy consumption under stringent inference accuracy and latency constraints. To address the challenge of characterizing inference accuracy, we derive an explicit approximation for it by analyzing the impact of sensing, communication, and computation processes on the inference performance. Building upon the analytical results, we propose an iterative algorithm employing alternating optimization to solve the resource allocation problem. In each subproblem, the optimal solutions are available by respectively applying a golden section search method and checking the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, thereby ensuring the convergence to a local optimum of the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISCC design, showing a significant reduction in energy consumption of up to 40% compared to existing methods, particularly in low-latency scenarios.

Title: Error Bounds Revisited, and How to Use Bayesian Statistics While Remaining a Frequentist
Authors: Ning Xu, Christopher M. Foster, Jonathan H. Manton
Abstract: Signal processing makes extensive use of point estimators and accompanying error bounds. These work well up until the likelihood function has two or more high peaks. When it is important for an estimator to remain reliable, it becomes necessary to consider alternatives, such as set estimators. An obvious first choice might be confidence intervals or confidence regions, but there can be difficulties in computing and interpreting them (and sometimes they might still be blind to multiple peaks in the likelihood). Bayesians seize on this to argue for replacing confidence regions with credible regions. Yet Bayesian statistics require a prior, which is not always a natural part of the problem formulation. This paper demonstrates how a re-interpretation of the prior as a weighting function makes an otherwise Bayesian estimator meaningful in the frequentist context. The weighting function interpretation also serves as a reminder that an estimator should always be designed in the context of its intended application; unlike a prior which ostensibly depends on prior knowledge, a weighting function depends on the intended application. This paper uses the time-of-arrival (TOA) problem to illustrate all these points. It also derives a basic theory of region-based estimators distinct from confidence regions.

Title: Feasible Force Set Shaping for a Payload-Carrying Platform Consisting of Tiltable Multiple UAVs Connected Via Passive Hinge Joints
Authors: Takumi Ito, Hayato Kawashima, Riku Funada, Mitsuji Sampei
Abstract: This paper presents a method for shaping the feasible force set of a payload-carrying platform composed of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and proposes a control law that leverages the advantages of this shaped force set. The UAVs are connected to the payload through passively rotatable hinge joints. The joint angles are controlled by the differential thrust produced by the rotors, while the total force generated by all the rotors is responsible for controlling the payload. The shape of the set of the total force depends on the tilt angles of the UAVs, which allows us to shape the feasible force set by adjusting these tilt angles. This paper aims to ensure that the feasible force set encompasses the required shape, enabling the platform to generate force redundantly -meaning in various directions. We then propose a control law that takes advantage of this redundancy.

Title: SHAZAM: Self-Supervised Change Monitoring for Hazard Detection and Mapping
Authors: Samuel Garske, Konrad Heidler, Bradley Evans, KC Wong, Xiao Xiang Zhu
Abstract: The increasing frequency of environmental hazards due to climate change underscores the urgent need for effective monitoring systems. Current approaches either rely on expensive labelled datasets, struggle with seasonal variations, or require multiple observations for confirmation (which delays detection). To address these challenges, this work presents SHAZAM - Self-Supervised Change Monitoring for Hazard Detection and Mapping. SHAZAM uses a lightweight conditional UNet to generate expected images of a region of interest (ROI) for any day of the year, allowing for the direct modelling of normal seasonal changes and the ability to distinguish potential hazards. A modified structural similarity measure compares the generated images with actual satellite observations to compute region-level anomaly scores and pixel-level hazard maps. Additionally, a theoretically grounded seasonal threshold eliminates the need for dataset-specific optimisation. Evaluated on four diverse datasets that contain bushfires (wildfires), burned regions, extreme and out-of-season snowfall, floods, droughts, algal blooms, and deforestation, SHAZAM achieved F1 score improvements of between 0.066 and 0.234 over existing methods. This was achieved primarily through more effective hazard detection (higher recall) while using only 473K parameters. SHAZAM demonstrated superior mapping capabilities through higher spatial resolution and improved ability to suppress background features while accentuating both immediate and gradual hazards. SHAZAM has been established as an effective and generalisable solution for hazard detection and mapping across different geographical regions and a diverse range of hazards. The Python code is available at: this https URL

Title: Convergence of energy-based learning in linear resistive networks
Authors: Anne-Men Huijzer, Thomas Chaffey, Bart Besselink, Henk J. van Waarde
Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energy-based learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function, for any step size, giving a guarantee of convergence for the algorithm.

Title: BGM2Pose: Active 3D Human Pose Estimation with Non-Stationary Sounds
Authors: Yuto Shibata, Yusuke Oumi, Go Irie, Akisato Kimura, Yoshimitsu Aoki, Mariko Isogawa
Abstract: We propose BGM2Pose, a non-invasive 3D human pose estimation method using arbitrary music (e.g., background music) as active sensing signals. Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. Our datasets and code will be made publicly available.

Title: PodAgent: A Comprehensive Framework for Podcast Generation
Authors: Yujia Xiao, Lei He, Haohan Guo, Fenglong Xie, Tan Lee
Abstract: Existing Existing automatic audio generation methods struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent's effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through LLM-guided synthesis.

Title: Bring Your Own Grasp Generator: Leveraging Robot Grasp Generation for Prosthetic Grasping
Authors: Giuseppe Stracquadanio, Federico Vasile, Elisa Maiettini, Nicolò Boccardo, Lorenzo Natale
Abstract: One of the most important research challenges in upper-limb prosthetics is enhancing the user-prosthesis communication to closely resemble the experience of a natural limb. As prosthetic devices become more complex, users often struggle to control the additional degrees of freedom. In this context, leveraging shared-autonomy principles can significantly improve the usability of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel eye-in-hand prosthetic grasping system that follows these principles. Our system initiates the approach-to-grasp action based on user's command and automatically configures the DoFs of a prosthetic hand. First, it reconstructs the 3D geometry of the target object without the need of a depth camera. Then, it tracks the hand motion during the approach-to-grasp action and finally selects a candidate grasp configuration according to user's intentions. We deploy our system on the Hannes prosthetic hand and test it on able-bodied subjects and amputees to validate its effectiveness. We compare it with a multi-DoF prosthetic control baseline and find that our method enables faster grasps, while simplifying the user experience.

Title: Adaptive Rectangular Convolution for Remote Sensing Pansharpening
Authors: Xueyang Wang, Zhixin Zheng, Jiandong Shao, Yule Duan, Liang-Jian Deng
Abstract: Recent advancements in convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques for remote sensing pansharpening have markedly enhanced image quality. However, conventional convolutional modules in these methods have two critical drawbacks. First, the sampling positions in convolution operations are confined to a fixed square window. Second, the number of sampling points is preset and remains unchanged. Given the diverse object sizes in remote sensing images, these rigid parameters lead to suboptimal feature extraction. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative convolutional module, Adaptive Rectangular Convolution (ARConv). ARConv adaptively learns both the height and width of the convolutional kernel and dynamically adjusts the number of sampling points based on the learned scale. This approach enables ARConv to effectively capture scale-specific features of various objects within an image, optimizing kernel sizes and sampling locations. Additionally, we propose ARNet, a network architecture in which ARConv is the primary convolutional module. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets reveal the superiority of our method in enhancing pansharpening performance over previous techniques. Ablation studies and visualization further confirm the efficacy of ARConv.

Authors: Zhikang Ge, Fang Yang, Wenwu Lu, Peng Wei, Yibin Ying, Chen Peng
Abstract: Autonomous Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) offer a promising solution for automating fishnet inspection, reducing labor dependency, and improving operational efficiency. In this paper, we modify an off-the-shelf ROV, the BlueROV2, into a ROS-based framework and develop a localization module, a path planning system, and a control framework. For real-time, local localization, we employ the open-source TagSLAM library. Additionally, we propose a control strategy based on a Nominal Feedback Controller (NFC) to achieve precise trajectory tracking. The proposed system has been implemented and validated through experiments in a controlled laboratory environment, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications.

Title: A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle
Authors: Manuel Baltieri, Martin Biehl, Matteo Capucci, Nathaniel Virgo
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of `model' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of `interpretation', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.

Title: GaussianSeal: Rooting Adaptive Watermarks for 3D Gaussian Generation Model
Authors: Runyi Li, Xuanyu Zhang, Chuhan Tong, Zhipei Xu, Jian Zhang
Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC technologies, the modalities generated by models have expanded from images and videos to 3D objects, leading to an increasing number of works focused on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) generative models. Existing research on copyright protection for generative models has primarily concentrated on watermarking in image and text modalities, with little exploration into the copyright protection of 3D object generative models. In this paper, we propose the first bit watermarking framework for 3DGS generative models, named GaussianSeal, to enable the decoding of bits as copyright identifiers from the rendered outputs of generated 3DGS. By incorporating adaptive bit modulation modules into the generative model and embedding them into the network blocks in an adaptive way, we achieve high-precision bit decoding with minimal training overhead while maintaining the fidelity of the model's outputs. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms post-processing watermarking approaches for 3DGS objects, achieving superior performance of watermark decoding accuracy and preserving the quality of the generated results.

Title: Brain Foundation Models: A Survey on Advancements in Neural Signal Processing and Brain Discovery
Authors: Xinliang Zhou, Chenyu Liu, Zhisheng Chen, Kun Wang, Yi Ding, Ziyu Jia, Qingsong Wen
Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.

Title: ATMO: An Aerially Transforming Morphobot for Dynamic Ground-Aerial Transition
Authors: Ioannis Mandralis, Reza Nemovi, Alireza Ramezani, Richard M. Murray, Morteza Gharib
Abstract: Designing ground-aerial robots is challenging due to the increased actuation requirements which can lead to added weight and reduced locomotion efficiency. Morphobots mitigate this by combining actuators into multi-functional groups and leveraging ground transformation to achieve different locomotion modes. However, transforming on the ground requires dealing with the complexity of ground-vehicle interactions during morphing, limiting applicability on rough terrain. Mid-air transformation offers a solution to this issue but demands operating near or beyond actuator limits while managing complex aerodynamic forces. We address this problem by introducing the Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), a robot which transforms near the ground achieving smooth transition between aerial and ground modes. To achieve this, we leverage the near ground aerodynamics, uncovered by experimental load cell testing, and stabilize the system using a model-predictive controller that adapts to ground proximity and body shape. The system is validated through numerous experimental demonstrations. We find that ATMO can land smoothly at body postures past its actuator saturation limits by virtue of the uncovered ground-effect.

Authors: Lucas Almeida
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive approach for the safety-critical control of robotic manipulators operating in dynamic environments. Building upon the framework of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we extend the collision cone methodology to formulate Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions (C3BFs) specifically tailored for manipulators. In our approach, safety constraints derived from collision cone geometry are seamlessly integrated with Cartesian impedance control to ensure compliant yet safe end-effector behavior. A Quadratic Program (QP)-based controller is developed to minimally modify the nominal control input to enforce safety. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in various dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Production Lines and Conveying Systems are the staple of modern manufacturing processes. Manufacturing efficiency is directly related to the efficiency of the means of production and conveying. Modelling in the industrial context has always been a challenge due to the complexity that comes along with modern manufacturing standards. Long Short-Term Memory is a pattern recognition Recurrent Neural Network, that is utilised on a simple pneumatic conveying system which transports a wooden block around the system. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capture temporal dependencies through feedback loops, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks enhance this capability by using gated mechanisms to effectively learn long-term dependencies. Conveying systems, representing a major component of production lines, are chosen as the target to model to present an approach applicable in large scale production lines in a simpler format. In this paper data from sensors are used to train the LSTM in order to output an Automaton that models the conveying system. The automaton obtained from the proposed LSTM approach is compared with the automaton obtained from OTALA. The resultant LSTM automaton proves to be a more accurate representation of the conveying system, unlike the one obtained from OTALA.

Title: Self-supervision via Controlled Transformation and Unpaired Self-conditioning for Low-light Image Enhancement
Authors: Aupendu Kar, Sobhan K. Dhara, Debashis Sen, Prabir K. Biswas
Abstract: Real-world low-light images captured by imaging devices suffer from poor visibility and require a domain-specific enhancement to produce artifact-free outputs that reveal details. In this paper, we propose an unpaired low-light image enhancement network leveraging novel controlled transformation-based self-supervision and unpaired self-conditioning strategies. The model determines the required degrees of enhancement at the input image pixels, which are learned from the unpaired low-lit and well-lit images without any direct supervision. The self-supervision is based on a controlled transformation of the input image and subsequent maintenance of its enhancement in spite of the transformation. The self-conditioning performs training of the model on unpaired images such that it does not enhance an already-enhanced image or a well-lit input image. The inherent noise in the input low-light images is handled by employing low gradient magnitude suppression in a detail-preserving manner. In addition, our noise handling is self-conditioned by preventing the denoising of noise-free well-lit images. The training based on low-light image enhancement-specific attributes allows our model to avoid paired supervision without compromising significantly in performance. While our proposed self-supervision aids consistent enhancement, our novel self-conditioning facilitates adequate enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that our model, in general, outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and subjectively. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of our self-supervision and self-conditioning strategies, and the related loss functions.

Title: Implicit Generative Modeling by Kernel Similarity Matching
Authors: Shubham Choudhary, Paul Masset, Demba Ba
Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes stimuli has been a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience. Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).

Title: CREATE-FFPE: Cross-Resolution Compensated and Multi-Frequency Enhanced FS-to-FFPE Stain Transfer for Intraoperative IHC Images
Authors: Yiyang Lin, Danling Jiang, Xinyu Liu, Yun Miao, Yixuan Yuan
Abstract: In the immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis during surgery, frozen-section (FS) images are used to determine the benignity or malignancy of the tumor. However, FS image faces problems such as image contamination and poor nuclear detail, which may disturb the pathologist's diagnosis. In contrast, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) image has a higher staining quality, but it requires quite a long time to prepare and thus is not feasible during surgery. To help pathologists observe IHC images with high quality in surgery, this paper proposes a Cross-REsolution compensATed and multi-frequency Enhanced FS-to-FFPE (CREATE-FFPE) stain transfer framework, which is the first FS-to-FFPE method for the intraoperative IHC images. To solve the slide contamination and poor nuclear detail mentioned above, we propose the cross-resolution compensation module (CRCM) and the wavelet detail guidance module (WDGM). Specifically, CRCM compensates for information loss due to contamination by providing more tissue information across multiple resolutions, while WDGM produces the desirable details in a wavelet way, and the details can be used to guide the stain transfer to be more precise. Experiments show our method can beat all the competing methods on our dataset. In addition, the FID has decreased by 44.4%, and KID*100 has decreased by 71.2% by adding the proposed CRCM and WDGM in ablation studies, and the performance of a downstream microsatellite instability prediction task with public dataset can be greatly improved by performing our FS-to-FFPE stain transfer.

Title: Unifying Light Field Perception with Field of Parallax
Authors: Fei Teng, Buyin Deng, Boyuan Zheng, Kai Luo, Kunyu Peng, Jiaming Zhang, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Field of Parallax (FoP)}, a spatial field that distills the common features from different LF representations to provide flexible and consistent support for multi-task learning. FoP is built upon three core features--projection difference, adjacency divergence, and contextual consistency--which are essential for cross-task adaptability. To implement FoP, we design a two-step angular adapter: the first step captures angular-specific differences, while the second step consolidates contextual consistency to ensure robust representation. Leveraging the FoP-based representation, we introduce the LFX framework, the first to handle arbitrary LF representations seamlessly, unifying LF multi-task vision. We evaluated LFX across three different tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, compared with previous task-specific architectures: 84.74% in mIoU for semantic segmentation on UrbanLF, 0.84% in AP for object detection on PKU, and 0.030 in MAE and 0.026 in MAE for salient object detection on Duftv2 and PKU, respectively. The source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: TRACE: A Self-Improving Framework for Robot Behavior Forecasting with Vision-Language Models
Authors: Gokul Puthumanaillam, Paulo Padrao, Jose Fuentes, Pranay Thangeda, William E. Schafer, Jae Hyuk Song, Karan Jagdale, Leonardo Bobadilla, Melkior Ornik
Abstract: Predicting the near-term behavior of a reactive agent is crucial in many robotic scenarios, yet remains challenging when observations of that agent are sparse or intermittent. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising avenue by integrating textual domain knowledge with visual cues, but their one-shot predictions often miss important edge cases and unusual maneuvers. Our key insight is that iterative, counterfactual exploration--where a dedicated module probes each proposed behavior hypothesis, explicitly represented as a plausible trajectory, for overlooked possibilities--can significantly enhance VLM-based behavioral forecasting. We present TRACE (Tree-of-thought Reasoning And Counterfactual Exploration), an inference framework that couples tree-of-thought generation with domain-aware feedback to refine behavior hypotheses over multiple rounds. Concretely, a VLM first proposes candidate trajectories for the agent; a counterfactual critic then suggests edge-case variations consistent with partial observations, prompting the VLM to expand or adjust its hypotheses in the next iteration. This creates a self-improving cycle where the VLM progressively internalizes edge cases from previous rounds, systematically uncovering not only typical behaviors but also rare or borderline maneuvers, ultimately yielding more robust trajectory predictions from minimal sensor data. We validate TRACE on both ground-vehicle simulations and real-world marine autonomous surface vehicles. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms standard VLM-driven and purely model-based baselines, capturing a broader range of feasible agent behaviors despite sparse sensing.

Title: MR-EIT: Multi-Resolution Reconstruction for Electrical Impedance Tomography via Data-Driven and Unsupervised Dual-Mode Neural Networks
Authors: Fangming Shi, Jinzhen Liu, Xiangqian Meng, Yapeng Zhou, Hui Xiong
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-resolution reconstruction method for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), referred to as MR-EIT, which is capable of operating in both supervised and unsupervised learning modes. MR-EIT integrates an ordered feature extraction module and an unordered coordinate feature expression module. The former achieves the mapping from voltage to two-dimensional conductivity features through pre-training, while the latter realizes multi-resolution reconstruction independent of the order and size of the input sequence by utilizing symmetric functions and local feature extraction mechanisms. In the data-driven mode, MR-EIT reconstructs high-resolution images from low-resolution data of finite element meshes through two stages of pre-training and joint training, and demonstrates excellent performance in simulation experiments. In the unsupervised learning mode, MR-EIT does not require pre-training data and performs iterative optimization solely based on measured voltages to rapidly achieve image reconstruction from low to high resolution. It shows robustness to noise and efficient super-resolution reconstruction capabilities in both simulation and real water tank experiments. Experimental results indicate that MR-EIT outperforms the comparison methods in terms of Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Relative Image Error (RIE), especially in the unsupervised learning mode, where it can significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve image reconstruction quality.

Title: Optimal Bilinear Equalizer Beamforming Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks with Arbitrary Channel Estimators
Authors: Zhe Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Hao Lei, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) beamforming design for both the uplink and downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks. We consider arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators over spatially correlated Rician fading channels. In the uplink, we derive the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) performance and OBE combining schemes with arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators and compute their respective closed-form expressions. It is insightful to explore that the achievable SE performance is not dependent on the choice of channel estimator when OBE combining schemes are applied over Rayleigh channels. In the downlink, we derive the achievable SE performance expressions with BE precoding schemes and arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators utilized and compute them in closed form. Then, we obtain the OBE precoding scheme leveraging insights from uplink OBE combining schemes.

Title: Acoustic Anomaly Detection on UAM Propeller Defect with Acoustic dataset for Crack of drone Propeller (ADCP)
Authors: Juho Lee, Donghyun Yoon, Gumoon Jeong, Hyeoncheol Kim
Abstract: The imminent commercialization of UAM requires stable, AI-based maintenance systems to ensure safety for both passengers and pedestrians. This paper presents a methodology for non-destructively detecting cracks in UAM propellers using drone propeller sound datasets. Normal operating sounds were recorded, and abnormal sounds (categorized as ripped and broken) were differentiated by varying the microphone-propeller angle and throttle power. Our novel approach integrates FFT and STFT preprocessing techniques to capture both global frequency patterns and local time-frequency variations, thereby enhancing anomaly detection performance. The constructed Acoustic Dataset for Crack of Drone Propeller (ADCP) demonstrates the potential for detecting propeller cracks and lays the groundwork for future UAM maintenance applications.

Title: Unveiling Biases while Embracing Sustainability: Assessing the Dual Challenges of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems
Authors: Ajinkya Kulkarni, Atharva Kulkarni, Miguel Couceiro, Isabel Trancoso
Abstract: In this paper, we present a bias and sustainability focused investigation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, namely Whisper and Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), which have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances. Despite their improved performance in controlled settings, there remains a critical gap in understanding their efficacy and equity in real-world scenarios. We analyze ASR biases w.r.t. gender, accent, and age group, as well as their effect on downstream tasks. In addition, we examine the environmental impact of ASR systems, scrutinizing the use of large acoustic models on carbon emission and energy consumption. We also provide insights into our empirical analyses, offering a valuable contribution to the claims surrounding bias and sustainability in ASR systems.

Title: High-Q non-invasive Glucose Sensor using MicrostripLine Main Field and Split Ring Resonator
Authors: Brandon Kaiheng Tay, Saumitra Kapoor, Wenwei Yu, Shao Ying Huang
Abstract: A high-Q sensor integrating microstrip line (MLIN) main field and split ring resonators is presented for non-invasive glucose sensing. The proposed sensor combines the field-focusing effects of split ring resonators with the enhanced field substrate interaction properties of the MLIN main field, using the reflection coefficient (S11) of an open-ended MLIN with the finger as the substrate and operating at 750 MHz and 1.5 GHz. The permittivity of blood inside the finger depends on the glucose concentration, which in turn affects the S11 of the system. Sensor geometry was optimized using Method-of-Moments simulation before the sensor was fabricated and validated on standard solutions of glucose concentrations between 0 to 126 mg/dL within the physiological range, and a human test subject. In both experiments, a near inverse-linear relationship between the S11 peak magnitude and the glucose concentration was observed, demonstrating the sensitivity of the proposed sensor for detecting changes in blood glucose concentration at physiological conditions.

Title: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Speech Translation Systems through Targeted Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Chang Liu, Haolin Wu, Xi Yang, Kui Zhang, Cong Wu, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu, Tianwei Zhang, Qing Guo, Jie Zhang
Abstract: As speech translation (ST) systems become increasingly prevalent, understanding their vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring robust and reliable communication. However, limited work has explored this issue in depth. This paper explores methods of compromising these systems through imperceptible audio manipulations. Specifically, we present two innovative approaches: (1) the injection of perturbation into source audio, and (2) the generation of adversarial music designed to guide targeted translation, while also conducting more practical over-the-air attacks in the physical world. Our experiments reveal that carefully crafted audio perturbations can mislead translation models to produce targeted, harmful outputs, while adversarial music achieve this goal more covertly, exploiting the natural imperceptibility of music. These attacks prove effective across multiple languages and translation models, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in current ST architectures. The implications of this research extend beyond immediate security concerns, shedding light on the interpretability and robustness of neural speech processing systems. Our findings underscore the need for advanced defense mechanisms and more resilient architectures in the realm of audio systems. More details and samples can be found at this https URL.

Title: One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects in Egocentric Organizing Scenes
Authors: Wanjun Jia, Fan Yang, Mengfei Duan, Xianchi Chen, Yinxi Wang, Yiming Jiang, Wenrui Chen, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li
Abstract: Deformable object manipulation in robotics presents significant challenges due to uncertainties in component properties, diverse configurations, visual interference, and ambiguous prompts. These factors complicate both perception and control tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects (OS-AGDO) in egocentric organizing scenes, enabling robots to recognize previously unseen deformable objects with varying colors and shapes using minimal samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Deformable Object Semantic Enhancement Module (DefoSEM), which enhances hierarchical understanding of the internal structure and improves the ability to accurately identify local features, even under conditions of weak component information. Next, we propose the ORB-Enhanced Keypoint Fusion Module (OEKFM), which optimizes feature extraction of key components by leveraging geometric constraints and improves adaptability to diversity and visual interference. Additionally, we propose an instance-conditional prompt based on image data and task context, effectively mitigates the issue of region ambiguity caused by prompt words. To validate these methods, we construct a diverse real-world dataset, AGDDO15, which includes 15 common types of deformable objects and their associated organizational actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 6.2%, 3.2%, and 2.9% in KLD, SIM, and NSS metrics, respectively, while exhibiting high generalization performance. Source code and benchmark dataset will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Talking Turns: Benchmarking Audio Foundation Models on Turn-Taking Dynamics
Authors: Siddhant Arora, Zhiyun Lu, Chung-Cheng Chiu, Ruoming Pang, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: The recent wave of audio foundation models (FMs) could provide new capabilities for conversational modeling. However, there have been limited efforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have natural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation with the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent succession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of silence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement. We will open source our evaluation platform to promote the development of advanced conversational AI systems.

Title: SAR-W-MixMAE: SAR Foundation Model Training Using Backscatter Power Weighting
Authors: Ali Caglayan, Nevrez Imamoglu, Toru Kouyama
Abstract: Foundation model approaches such as masked auto-encoders (MAE) or its variations are now being successfully applied to satellite imagery. Most of the ongoing technical validation of foundation models have been applied to optical images like RGB or multi-spectral images. Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise content with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle noise and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model.

Title: A Multi-Sensor Fusion Approach for Rapid Orthoimage Generation in Large-Scale UAV Mapping
Authors: Jialei He, Zhihao Zhan, Zhituo Tu, Xiang Zhu, Jie Yuan
Abstract: Rapid generation of large-scale orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been a long-standing focus of research in the field of aerial mapping. A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate feature matching orthoimage generation in a short time. The proposed drone system effectively aids in farmland detection and management.

Title: Enhancing Network Security Management in Water Systems using FM-based Attack Attribution
Authors: Aleksandar Avdalovic, Joseph Khoury, Ahmad Taha, Elias Bou-Harb
Abstract: Water systems are vital components of modern infrastructure, yet they are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber attacks with potentially dire consequences on public health and safety. While state-of-the-art machine learning techniques effectively detect anomalies, contemporary model-agnostic attack attribution methods using LIME, SHAP, and LEMNA are deemed impractical for large-scale, interdependent water systems. This is due to the intricate interconnectivity and dynamic interactions that define these complex environments. Such methods primarily emphasize individual feature importance while falling short of addressing the crucial sensor-actuator interactions in water systems, which limits their effectiveness in identifying root cause attacks. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Factorization Machines (FM)-based approach that capitalizes on water system sensor-actuator interactions to provide granular explanations and attributions for cyber attacks. For instance, an anomaly in an actuator pump activity can be attributed to a top root cause attack candidates, a list of water pressure sensors, which is derived from the underlying linear and quadratic effects captured by our approach. We validate our method using two real-world water system specific datasets, SWaT and WADI, demonstrating its superior performance over traditional attribution methods. In multi-feature cyber attack scenarios involving intricate sensor-actuator interactions, our FM-based attack attribution method effectively ranks attack root causes, achieving approximately 20% average improvement over SHAP and LEMNA.

Title: Voice Cloning for Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Addressing Data Scarcity in Speech-Language Pathology
Authors: Birger Moell, Fredrik Sand Aronsson
Abstract: This study explores voice cloning to generate synthetic speech replicating the unique patterns of individuals with dysarthria. Using the TORGO dataset, we address data scarcity and privacy challenges in speech-language pathology. Our contributions include demonstrating that voice cloning preserves dysarthric speech characteristics, analyzing differences between real and synthetic data, and discussing implications for diagnostics, rehabilitation, and communication. We cloned voices from dysarthric and control speakers using a commercial platform, ensuring gender-matched synthetic voices. A licensed speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluated a subset for dysarthria, speaker gender, and synthetic indicators. The SLP correctly identified dysarthria in all cases and speaker gender in 95% but misclassified 30% of synthetic samples as real, indicating high realism. Our results suggest synthetic speech effectively captures disordered characteristics and that voice cloning has advanced to produce high-quality data resembling real speech, even to trained professionals. This has critical implications for healthcare, where synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity, protect privacy, and enhance AI-driven diagnostics. By enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality speech datasets, voice cloning can improve generalizable models, personalize therapy, and advance assistive technologies for dysarthria. We publicly release our synthetic dataset to foster further research and collaboration, aiming to develop robust models that improve patient outcomes in speech-language pathology.

Authors: An-Chi He, Jungsoo Park, Benjamin Beiter, Bhaben Kalita, Alexander Leonessa (Virginia Tech)
Abstract: This work presents the design, build, control, and preliminary user data of a locomotion interface called ForceBot. It delivers lower-body haptic interaction in virtual reality (VR), enabling users to walk in VR while interacting with various simulated terrains. It utilizes two planar gantries to give each foot two degrees of freedom and passive heel-lifting motion. The design used motion capture data with dynamic simulation for ergonomic human-robot workspace and hardware selection. Its system framework uses open-source robotic software and pairs with a custom-built power delivery system that offers EtherCAT communication with a 1,000 Hz soft real-time computation rate. This system features an admittance controller to regulate physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) alongside a walking algorithm to generate walking motion and simulate virtual terrains. The system's performance is explored through three measurements that evaluate the relationship between user input force and output pHRI motion. Overall, this platform presents a unique approach by utilizing planar gantries to realize VR terrain interaction with an extensive workspace, reasonably compact footprint, and preliminary user data.

Title: Stone Soup Multi-Target Tracking Feature Extraction For Autonomous Search And Track In Deep Reinforcement Learning Environment
Authors: Jan-Hendrik Ewers, Joe Gibbs, David Anderson
Abstract: Management of sensing resources is a non-trivial problem for future military air assets with future systems deploying heterogeneous sensors to generate information of the battlespace. Machine learning techniques including deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have been identified as promising approaches, but require high-fidelity training environments and feature extractors to generate information for the agent. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning training approach, utilising the Stone Soup tracking framework as a feature extractor to train an agent for a sensor management task. A general framework for embedding Stone Soup tracker components within a Gymnasium environment is presented, enabling fast and configurable tracker deployments for RL training using Stable Baselines3. The approach is demonstrated in a sensor management task where an agent is trained to search and track a region of airspace utilising track lists generated from Stone Soup trackers. A sample implementation using three neural network architectures in a search-and-track scenario demonstrates the approach and shows that RL agents can outperform simple sensor search and track policies when trained within the Gymnasium and Stone Soup environment.

Title: Streaming Piano Transcription Based on Consistent Onset and Offset Decoding with Sustain Pedal Detection
Authors: Weixing Wei, Jiahao Zhao, Yulun Wu, Kazuyoshi Yoshii
Abstract: This paper describes a streaming audio-to-MIDI piano transcription approach that aims to sequentially translate a music signal into a sequence of note onset and offset events. The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.

Title: Learning Actionable World Models for Industrial Process Control
Authors: Peng Yan, Ahmed Abdulkadir, Gerrit A. Schatte, Giulia Anguzzi, Joonsu Gha, Nikola Pascher, Matthias Rosenthal, Yunlong Gao, Benjamin F. Grewe, Thilo Stadelmann
Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process in- and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors that influence the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.

Title: DLF: Extreme Image Compression with Dual-generative Latent Fusion
Authors: Naifu Xue, Zhaoyang Jia, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu
Abstract: Recent studies in extreme image compression have achieved remarkable performance by compressing the tokens from generative tokenizers. However, these methods often prioritize clustering common semantics within the dataset, while overlooking the diverse details of individual objects. Consequently, this results in suboptimal reconstruction fidelity, especially at low bitrates. To address this issue, we introduce a Dual-generative Latent Fusion (DLF) paradigm. DLF decomposes the latent into semantic and detail elements, compressing them through two distinct branches. The semantic branch clusters high-level information into compact tokens, while the detail branch encodes perceptually critical details to enhance the overall fidelity. Additionally, we propose a cross-branch interactive design to reduce redundancy between the two branches, thereby minimizing the overall bit cost. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive reconstruction quality of DLF even below 0.01 bits per pixel (bpp). On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings of up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM. Furthermore, DLF surpasses recent diffusion-based codecs in visual fidelity while maintaining a comparable level of generative realism. Code will be available later.

Title: FlowDec: A flow-based full-band general audio codec with high perceptual quality
Authors: Simon Welker, Matthew Le, Ricky T. Q. Chen, Wei-Ning Hsu, Timo Gerkmann, Alexander Richard, Yi-Chiao Wu
Abstract: We propose FlowDec, a neural full-band audio codec for general audio sampled at 48 kHz that combines non-adversarial codec training with a stochastic postfilter based on a novel conditional flow matching method. Compared to the prior work ScoreDec which is based on score matching, we generalize from speech to general audio and move from 24 kbit/s to as low as 4 kbit/s, while improving output quality and reducing the required postfilter DNN evaluations from 60 to 6 without any fine-tuning or distillation techniques. We provide theoretical insights and geometric intuitions for our approach in comparison to ScoreDec as well as another recent work that uses flow matching, and conduct ablation studies on our proposed components. We show that FlowDec is a competitive alternative to the recent GAN-dominated stream of neural codecs, achieving FAD scores better than those of the established GAN-based codec DAC and listening test scores that are on par, and producing qualitatively more natural reconstructions for speech and harmonic structures in music.

Title: Carleman-Fourier linearization of nonlinear real dynamical systems with quasi-periodic fields
Authors: Nader Motee, Qiyu Sun
Abstract: This work presents Carleman-Fourier linearization for analyzing nonlinear real dynamical systems with quasi-periodic vector fields characterized by multiple fundamental frequencies. Using Fourier basis functions, this novel framework transforms such dynamical systems into equivalent infinite-dimensional linear dynamical systems. In this work, we establish the exponential convergence of the primary block in the finite-section approximation of this linearized system to the state vector of the original nonlinear system. To showcase the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the Kuramoto model, a prominent model for coupled oscillators. The results demonstrate promising accuracy in approximating the original system's behavior.

Title: AutoLUT: LUT-Based Image Super-Resolution with Automatic Sampling and Adaptive Residual Learning
Authors: Yuheng Xu, Shijie Yang, Xin Liu, Jie Liu, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu
Abstract: In recent years, the increasing popularity of Hi-DPI screens has driven a rising demand for high-resolution images. However, the limited computational power of edge devices poses a challenge in deploying complex super-resolution neural networks, highlighting the need for efficient methods. While prior works have made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level information. Moreover, their reliance on fixed sampling patterns limits both accuracy and the ability to capture fine details in low-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce two plug-and-play modules designed to capture and leverage pixel information effectively in Look-Up Table (LUT) based super-resolution networks. Our method introduces Automatic Sampling (AutoSample), a flexible LUT sampling approach where sampling weights are automatically learned during training to adapt to pixel variations and expand the receptive field without added inference cost. We also incorporate Adaptive Residual Learning (AdaRL) to enhance inter-layer connections, enabling detailed information flow and improving the network's ability to reconstruct fine details. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on both MuLUT and SPF-LUT while maintaining similar storage sizes. Specifically, for MuLUT, we achieve a PSNR improvement of approximately +0.20 dB improvement on average across five datasets. For SPF-LUT, with more than a 50% reduction in storage space and about a 2/3 reduction in inference time, our method still maintains performance comparable to the original. The code is available at this https URL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, existing foundation models rely on multi-stage processing or complex architectures for predicting multiple codebooks, limiting efficiency and integration flexibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spark-TTS, a novel system powered by BiCodec, a single-stream speech codec that decomposes speech into two complementary token types: low-bitrate semantic tokens for linguistic content and fixed-length global tokens for speaker attributes. This disentangled representation, combined with the Qwen2.5 LLM and a chain-of-thought (CoT) generation approach, enables both coarse-grained control (e.g., gender, speaking style) and fine-grained adjustments (e.g., precise pitch values, speaking rate). To facilitate research in controllable TTS, we introduce VoxBox, a meticulously curated 100,000-hour dataset with comprehensive attribute annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spark-TTS not only achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning but also generates highly customizable voices that surpass the limitations of reference-based synthesis.

Title: Application of the List Viterbi Algorithm for Satellite-based AIS Detection
Authors: Linda Kanaan, Karine Amis, Frédéric Guilloud, Rémi Chauvat
Abstract: Satellites receiving Automatic Identification System (AIS) packets in dense areas are particularly prone to AIS channel overload due to the extensive number of vessels. Thus a failure of detection might be caused by the collisions among AIS messages. To improve the detection capability, we propose to exploit the presence of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in AIS frames by using the parallel list Viterbi algorithm (PLVA) instead of the classical Viterbi algorithm (VA) often used for decoding AIS signals. The performance of combining the PLVA with AIS post processing including the CRC is studied with two detectors, one coherent and the other differential, in two channel models: a single-user AWGN channel and a more realistic multiple-access AIS channel. We also show the impact of the PLVA parameters on the success recovery rate. The simulation results show that the resulting procedure can significantly improve the packet error rate (PER) at the cost of a limited increase of the computational complexity. The proposed technique could be applied to improve the performance of interference cancellation receivers by significantly lowering the AIS decoding threshold.

Title: ECG-EmotionNet: Nested Mixture of Expert (NMoE) Adaptation of ECG-Foundation Model for Driver Emotion Recognition
Authors: Nastaran Mansourian, Arash Mohammadi, M. Omair Ahmad, M.N.S. Swamy
Abstract: Driver emotion recognition plays a crucial role in driver monitoring systems, enhancing human-autonomy interactions and the trustworthiness of Autonomous Driving (AD). Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.

Title: Nanosatellite Constellation and Ground Station Co-design for Low-Latency Critical Event Detection
Authors: Zhuo Cheng, Brandon Lucia
Abstract: Advancements in nanosatellite technology lead to more Earth-observation satellites in low-Earth orbit. We explore using nanosatellite constellations to achieve low-latency detection for time-critical events, such as forest fires, oil spills, and floods. The detection latency comprises three parts: capture, compute and transmission. Previous solutions reduce transmission latency, but we find that the bottleneck is capture latency, accounting for more than 90% of end-to-end latency. We present a measurement study on how various satellite and ground station design factors affect latency. We offer design guidance to operators on how to choose satellite orbital configurations and design an algorithm to choose ground station locations. For six use cases, our design guidance reduces end-to-end latency by 5.6 to 8.2 times compared to the existing system.

Title: m4: A Learned Flow-level Network Simulator
Authors: Chenning Li, Anton A. Zabreyko, Arash Nasr-Esfahany, Kevin Zhao, Prateesh Goyal, Mohammad Alizadeh, Thomas Anderson
Abstract: Flow-level simulation is widely used to model large-scale data center networks due to its scalability. Unlike packet-level simulators that model individual packets, flow-level simulators abstract traffic as continuous flows with dynamically assigned transmission rates. While this abstraction enables orders-of-magnitude speedup, it is inaccurate by omitting critical packet-level effects such as queuing, congestion control, and retransmissions. We present m4, an accurate and scalable flow-level simulator that uses machine learning to learn the dynamics of the network of interest. At the core of m4 lies a novel ML architecture that decomposes state transition computations into distinct spatial and temporal components, each represented by a suitable neural network. To efficiently learn the underlying flow-level dynamics, m4 adds dense supervision signals by predicting intermediate network metrics such as remaining flow size and queue length during training. m4 achieves a speedup of up to 104$\times$ over packet-level simulation. Relative to a traditional flow-level simulation, m4 reduces per-flow estimation errors by 45.3% (mean) and 53.0% (p90). For closed-loop applications, m4 accurately predicts network throughput under various congestion control schemes and workloads.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based User Association in Hybrid LiFi/WiFi Indoor Networks
Authors: Peijun Hou, Nan Cen
Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) indoor networks has been envisioned as a promising technology to alleviate radio frequency spectrum crunch to accommodate the ever-increasing data rate demand in indoor scenarios. The hybrid LiFi/WiFi indoor networks can leverage the advantages of fast data transmission from LiFi and wider coverage of WiFi, thus complementing well with each other and further improving the network performance compared with the standalone networks. However, to leverage the co-existence, several challenges should be addressed, including but not limited to user association, mobility support, and efficient resource allocation. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to design a new user-access point association algorithm to maximize the sum throughput of the hybrid networks. We first mathematically formulate the sum data rate maximization problem by determining the AP selection for each user in indoor networks with consideration of user mobility and practical capacity limitations, which is a nonconvex binary integer programming problem. To solve this problem, we then propose a sequential-proximal policy optimization (S-PPO) based deep reinforcement learning method. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed method by comparing it with exhaustive search (ES), signal strength strategy (SSS), and trust region policy optimization (TRPO) methods. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our solution algorithm can outperform SSS by about 32.25% of the sum throughput and 19.09% of the fairness on average, and outperform TRPO by about 10.34% and 10.23%, respectively.

Title: Open-source framework for detecting bias and overfitting for large pathology images
Authors: Anders Sildnes, Nikita Shvetsov, Masoud Tafavvoghi, Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran, Kajsa Møllersen, Lill-Tove Rasmussen Busund, Thomas K. Kilvær, Lars Ailo Bongo
Abstract: Even foundational models that are trained on datasets with billions of data samples may develop shortcuts that lead to overfitting and bias. Shortcuts are non-relevant patterns in data, such as the background color or color intensity. So, to ensure the robustness of deep learning applications, there is a need for methods to detect and remove such shortcuts. Today's model debugging methods are time consuming since they often require customization to fit for a given model architecture in a specific domain. We propose a generalized, model-agnostic framework to debug deep learning models. We focus on the domain of histopathology, which has very large images that require large models - and therefore large computation resources. It can be run on a workstation with a commodity GPU. We demonstrate that our framework can replicate non-image shortcuts that have been found in previous work for self-supervised learning models, and we also identify possible shortcuts in a foundation model. Our easy to use tests contribute to the development of more reliable, accurate, and generalizable models for WSI analysis. Our framework is available as an open-source tool available on github.

Title: Semantically Structured Image Compression via Irregular Group-Based Decoupling
Authors: Ruoyu Feng, Yixin Gao, Xin Jin, Runsen Feng, Zhibo Chen
Abstract: Image compression techniques typically focus on compressing rectangular images for human consumption, however, resulting in transmitting redundant content for downstream applications. To overcome this limitation, some previous works propose to semantically structure the bitstream, which can meet specific application requirements by selective transmission and reconstruction. Nevertheless, they divide the input image into multiple rectangular regions according to semantics and ignore avoiding information interaction among them, causing waste of bitrate and distorted reconstruction of region boundaries. In this paper, we propose to decouple an image into multiple groups with irregular shapes based on a customized group mask and compress them independently. Our group mask describes the image at a finer granularity, enabling significant bitrate saving by reducing the transmission of redundant content. Moreover, to ensure the fidelity of selective reconstruction, this paper proposes the concept of group-independent transform that maintain the independence among distinct groups. And we instantiate it by the proposed Group-Independent Swin-Block (GI Swin-Block). Experimental results demonstrate that our framework structures the bitstream with negligible cost, and exhibits superior performance on both visual quality and intelligent task supporting.

Title: Unsupervised Denoising for Signal-Dependent and Row-Correlated Imaging Noise
Authors: Benjamin Salmon, Alexander Krull
Abstract: Accurate analysis of microscopy images is hindered by the presence of noise. This noise is usually signal-dependent and often additionally correlated along rows or columns of pixels. Current self- and unsupervised denoisers can address signal-dependent noise, but none can reliably remove noise that is also row- or column-correlated. Here, we present the first fully unsupervised deep learning-based denoiser capable of handling imaging noise that is row-correlated as well as signal-dependent. Our approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a specially designed autoregressive decoder. This decoder is capable of modeling row-correlated and signal-dependent noise but is incapable of independently modeling underlying clean signal. The VAE therefore produces latent variables containing only clean signal information, and these are mapped back into image space using a proposed second decoder network. Our method does not require a pre-trained noise model and can be trained from scratch using unpaired noisy data. We benchmark our approach on microscopy datatsets from a range of imaging modalities and sensor types, each with row- or column-correlated, signal-dependent noise, and show that it outperforms existing self- and unsupervised denoisers.

Title: Finite Sample Performance Analysis of MIMO Systems Identification
Authors: Shuai Sun, Jiayun Li, Yilin Mo
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cramer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.

Title: The best autoregressive approach to audio inpainting is gap-wise Janssen
Authors: Ondřej Mokrý, Pavel Rajmic
Abstract: A novel variant of the Janssen method for audio inpainting is presented. The new method is compared with a number of other popular audio inpainting methods based on autoregressive modeling. Main differences between the particular approaches are pointed out. In the experimental part, the importance of the choice of the AR model estimator is confirmed by objective metrics, and the effect of the chosen AR model order and window size is explored. The results of small-scale and mid-scale computational experiments are in agreement. The results show the superiority of the proposed gap-wise Janssen approach, which is confirmed by a listening test.

Title: Symmetry-based Abstraction Algorithm for Accelerating Symbolic Control Synthesis
Authors: Hussein Sibai, Sacha Huriot, Tyler Martin, Murat Arcak
Abstract: We propose an efficient symbolic control synthesis algorithm for equivariant continuous-time dynamical systems to satisfy reach-avoid specifications. The algorithm exploits dynamical symmetries to construct lean abstractions to avoid redundant computations during synthesis. Our proposed algorithm adds another layer of abstraction over the common grid-based discrete abstraction before solving the synthesis problem. It combines each set of grid cells that are at a similar relative position from the targets and nearby obstacles, defined by the symmetries, into a single abstract state. It uses this layer of abstraction to guide the order by which actions are explored during synthesis over the grid-based abstraction. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by synthesizing a reach-avoid controller for a 3-dimensional ship model with translation and rotation symmetries in the special Euclidean group SE(2).

Title: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction with Reverse Selective Auditory Attention
Authors: Ruijie Tao, Xinyuan Qian, Yidi Jiang, Junjie Li, Jiadong Wang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) aims to extract the specific person's speech from the audio mixture given auxiliary visual cues. Previous methods usually search for the target voice through speech-lip synchronization. However, this strategy mainly focuses on the existence of target speech, while ignoring the variations of the noise characteristics, i.e., interference speaker and the background noise. That may result in extracting noisy signals from the incorrect sound source in challenging acoustic situations. To this end, we propose a novel selective auditory attention mechanism, which can suppress interference speakers and non-speech signals to avoid incorrect speaker extraction. By estimating and utilizing the undesired noisy signal through this mechanism, we design an AV-TSE framework named Subtraction-and-ExtrAction network (SEANet) to suppress the noisy signals. We conduct abundant experiments by re-implementing three popular AV-TSE methods as the baselines and involving nine metrics for evaluation. The experimental results show that our proposed SEANet achieves state-of-the-art results and performs well for all five datasets. The code can be found in: this https URL

Title: Nonparametric Control Koopman Operators
Authors: Petar Bevanda, Bas Driessen, Lucian Cristian Iacob, Stefan Sosnowski Roland Tóth, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman (composition) operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. As a consequence, our proposed framework allows for arbitrary accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.

Title: CLAMP: Majorized Plug-and-Play for Coherent 3D LIDAR Imaging
Authors: Tony G. Allen, David J. Rabb, Gregery T. Buzzard, Charles A. Bouman
Abstract: Coherent lidar uses a chirped laser pulse for 3D imaging of distant targets. However, existing coherent lidar image reconstruction methods do not account for the system's aperture, resulting in sub-optimal resolution. Moreover, these methods use majorization-minimization for computational efficiency, but do so without a theoretical treatment of convergence. In this paper, we present Coherent Lidar Aperture Modeled Plug-and-Play (CLAMP) for multi-look coherent lidar image reconstruction. CLAMP uses multi-agent consensus equilibrium (a form of PnP) to combine a neural network denoiser with an accurate surrogate forward model of coherent lidar. Additionally, CLAMP introduces a computationally efficient FFT-based method to account for the system's aperture to improve resolution of reconstructed images. Furthermore, we formalize the use of majorization-minimization in consensus optimization problems and prove convergence to the exact consensus equilibrium solution. Finally, we apply CLAMP to synthetic and measured data to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing high-resolution, speckle-free, 3D imagery.

Title: Optimizing a-DCF for Spoofing-Robust Speaker Verification
Authors: Oğuzhan Kurnaz, Jagabandhu Mishra, Tomi H. Kinnunen, Cemal Hanilçi
Abstract: Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. We propose a spoofing-robust ASV system optimized directly for the recently introduced architecture-agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF), which allows targeting a desired trade-off between the contradicting aims of user convenience and robustness to spoofing. We combine a-DCF and binary cross-entropy (BCE) with a novel straightforward threshold optimization technique. Our results with an embedding fusion system on ASVspoof2019 data demonstrate relative improvement of $13\%$ over a system trained using BCE only (from minimum a-DCF of $0.1445$ to $0.1254$). Using an alternative non-linear score fusion approach provides relative improvement of $43\%$ (from minimum a-DCF of $0.0508$ to $0.0289$).

Title: HDKD: Hybrid Data-Efficient Knowledge Distillation Network for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Omar S. EL-Assiouti, Ghada Hamed, Dina Khattab, Hala M. Ebied
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved significant advancement in computer vision tasks due to their powerful modeling capacity. However, their performance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of inherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous approaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some focused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT student, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate features due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated feature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced alignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to mismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end, this paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD) paradigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid student serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both convolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with the teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application of feature distillation without any information loss or additional computational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight convolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which serves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models. Extensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority of HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency. Source code at: this https URL

Title: Enabling Massive Index Modulation Systems via Combinatorics-Free Detection
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Takumi Takahashi, David González G., Osvaldo Gonsa
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) is one of the key enabling technologies for beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, attracting attention for its inherent energy and spectral efficiency resulting from conveying information through the indexation of the resources utilized in during signal transmission. However, a remaining critical bottleneck for large-scale IM is the consequently infeasible detection complexity of combinatoric order. Therefore in this article, in order to maximally reap the advantages of IM in large scenarios, we propose a novel message passing (MP) decoder designed under the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework exploiting a novel unit vector decomposition (UVD) of IM signals with purpose-derived novel probability distributions. The proposed method enjoys a low decoding complexity that is independent of previously prohibitive combinatorial factors, while still approach-ing the performance of unfeasible state-of-the-art (SotA) search-based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via complexity analysis and numerical results for the exemplary piloted generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GQSM) systems of truly massive sizes (up to 96 antennas).

Title: Reachset-Conformant System Identification
Authors: Laura Lützow, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: Formal verification techniques play a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of complex cyber-physical systems. To transfer model-based verification results to the real world, we require that the measurements of the target system lie in the set of reachable outputs of the corresponding model, a property we refer to as reachset conformance. This paper is on automatically identifying those reachset-conformant models. While state-of-the-art reachset-conformant identification methods focus on linear state-space models, we generalize these methods to nonlinear state-space models and linear and nonlinear input-output models. Furthermore, our identification framework adapts to different levels of prior knowledge on the system dynamics. In particular, we identify the set of model uncertainties for white-box models, the parameters and the set of model uncertainties for gray-box models, and entire reachset-conformant black-box models from data. The robustness and efficacy of our framework are demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real-world data.

Title: Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Visual Foundation Models
Authors: Yuetan Chu, Yilan Zhang, Zhongyi Han, Changchun Yang, Longxi Zhou, Gongning Luo, Chao Huang, Xin Gao
Abstract: Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.

Title: Optimal Bilinear Equalizer for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems over Correlated Rician Channels
Authors: Zhe Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Emil Björnson, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the low-complexity optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) combining scheme design for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks with spatially correlated Rician fading channels. We provide a spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for both the centralized and distributed processing schemes with bilinear equalizer (BE)-structure combining schemes applied. The BE-structured combining is a set of schemes that are constructed by the multiplications of channel statistics-based BE matrices and instantaneous channel estimates. Notably, we derive closed-form achievable SE expressions for centralized and distributed BE-structured combining schemes. We propose one centralized and two distributed OBE schemes: Centralized OBE (C-OBE), Distributed OBE based on Global channel statistics (DG-OBE), and Distributed OBE based on Local channel statistics (DL-OBE), which maximize their respective SE expressions. OBE matrices in these schemes are tailored based on varying levels of channel statistics. Notably, we obtain new and insightful closed-form results for the C-OBE, DG-OBE, and DL-OBE combining schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed OBE schemes can achieve excellent SE, even in scenarios with severe pilot contamination.

Title: Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations
Authors: Subham Sahoo
Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.

Title: On the Effects of Modeling Errors on Distributed Continuous-time Filtering
Authors: Xiaoxu Lyu, Shilei Li, Dawei Shi, Ling Shi
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Title: A Nonlinear Controller for Parallel DC-DC Converters with ZIP Load and Constrained Output Voltage
Authors: Somayyeh Bahrami
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear controller is designed for a parallel DC-DC converter system that feeds an unknown ZIP load, characterized by constant impedance (Z), constant current (I), and constant power (P), at the DC bus. The proposed controller ensures simultaneous voltage adjustment and power sharing in the large signal sense despite uncertainties in ZIP loads, DC input voltages, and other electrical parameters. To keep the output voltage within a desired range, we utilize a barrier function that is invertible, smoothly continuous, and strictly increasing. Its limits at infinity represent the upper and lower bounds for the output voltage. We apply the invertible transformation of the barrier function to the output voltage and then design the controller using the adaptive backstepping method. Using this barrier-function-based adaptive backstepping controller, uncertain parameters are identified on-line, and the voltage adjustment and power sharing objectives are established. Moreover, voltage constraint is not violated event in the presence of sudden and unknown large variations of load. The efficiency of the proposed nonlinear controller is evaluated through simulations of a parallel DC-DC converter system using the MATLAB/Simscape Electrical environment.

Title: Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation
Authors: Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Yudong Yang, Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Jimin Zhuang, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Guangzhi Sun, Lu Lu, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) \etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints can be found at this https URL.

Title: Fundamental Limits of Pulse Based UWB ISAC Systems: A Parameter Estimation Perspective
Authors: Fan Liu, Tingting Zhang, Zenan Zhang, Bin Cao, Yuan Shen, Qinyu Zhang
Abstract: Impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signals stand out for their high temporal resolution, low cost, and large bandwidth, making them a highly promising option for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we design an ISAC system for a bi-static passive sensing scenario that accommodates multiple targets. Specifically, we introduce two typical modulation schemes, PPM and BPSK, for data transmission. The essential coupling between sensing and communication is examined through the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Accordingly, we introduce a pilot-based decoupling approach that relies on known time-delays, as well as a differential decoupling strategy that uses a known starting symbol position. Finally, we assess the sensing and communication performance under various modulation and demodulation schemes under the constraints of current UWB standards. This assessment utilizes the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for sensing and the Shannon capacity limit for communication, offering theoretical insights into choosing suitable data signal processing methods in real-world applications.

Title: CT-Mamba: A Hybrid Convolutional State Space Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising
Authors: Linxuan Li, Wenjia Wei, Luyao Yang, Wenwen Zhang, Jiashu Dong, Yahua Liu, Hongshi Huang, Wei Zhao
Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) significantly reduces the radiation dose received by patients, however, dose reduction introduces additional noise and artifacts. Currently, denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) face limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, while Transformer-based denoising methods, although capable of powerful long-range modeling, suffer from high computational complexity. Furthermore, the denoised images predicted by deep learning-based techniques inevitably exhibit differences in noise distribution compared to normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which can also impact the final image quality and diagnostic outcomes. This paper proposes CT-Mamba, a hybrid convolutional State Space Model for LDCT image denoising. The model combines the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs with Mamba's strength in capturing long-range dependencies, enabling it to capture both local details and global context. Additionally, we introduce an innovative spatially coherent 'Z'-shaped scanning scheme to ensure spatial continuity between adjacent pixels in the image. We design a Mamba-driven deep noise power spectrum (NPS) loss function to guide model training, ensuring that the noise texture of the denoised LDCT images closely resembles that of NDCT images, thereby enhancing overall image quality and diagnostic value. Experimental results have demonstrated that CT-Mamba performs excellently in reducing noise in LDCT images, enhancing detail preservation, and optimizing noise texture distribution, and exhibits higher statistical similarity with the radiomics features of NDCT images. The proposed CT-Mamba demonstrates outstanding performance in LDCT denoising and holds promise as a representative approach for applying the Mamba framework to LDCT denoising tasks. Our code will be made available after the paper is officially published: this https URL.

Title: XLSR-Mamba: A Dual-Column Bidirectional State Space Model for Spoofing Attack Detection
Authors: Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: Transformers and their variants have achieved great success in speech processing. However, their multi-head self-attention mechanism is computationally expensive. Therefore, one novel selective state space model, Mamba, has been proposed as an alternative. Building on its success in automatic speech recognition, we apply Mamba for spoofing attack detection. Mamba is well-suited for this task as it can capture the artifacts in spoofed speech signals by handling long-length sequences. However, Mamba's performance may suffer when it is trained with limited labeled data. To mitigate this, we propose combining a new structure of Mamba based on a dual-column architecture with self-supervised learning, using the pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model. The experiments show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and faster inference on the ASVspoof 2021 LA and DF datasets, and on the more challenging In-the-Wild dataset, it emerges as the strongest candidate for spoofing attack detection. The code has been publicly released in this https URL.

Title: AnyECG: Foundational Models for Multitask Cardiac Analysis in Real-World Settings
Authors: Yue Wang, Xu Cao, Yaojun Hu, Haochao Ying, Hongxia Xu, Ruijia Wu, James Matthew Rehg, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu, Jintai Chen
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.

Title: Neural Finite-State Machines for Surgical Phase Recognition
Authors: Hao Ding, Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Tianyu Luan, Abhishek Sharma, Meng Zheng, Ange Lou, Terrence Chen, Mathias Unberath, Ziyan Wu
Abstract: Surgical phase recognition (SPR) is crucial for applications in workflow optimization, performance evaluation, and real-time intervention guidance. However, current deep learning models often struggle with fragmented predictions, failing to capture the sequential nature of surgical workflows. We propose the Neural Finite-State Machine (NFSM), a novel approach that enforces temporal coherence by integrating classical state-transition priors with modern neural networks. NFSM leverages learnable global state embeddings as unique phase identifiers and dynamic transition tables to model phase-to-phase progressions. Additionally, a future phase forecasting mechanism employs repeated frame padding to anticipate upcoming transitions. Implemented as a plug-and-play module, NFSM can be integrated into existing SPR pipelines without changing their core architectures. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including a significant improvement on the BernBypass70 dataset - raising video-level accuracy by 0.9 points and phase-level precision, recall, F1-score, and mAP by 3.8, 3.1, 3.3, and 4.1, respectively. Ablation studies confirm each component's effectiveness and the module's adaptability to various architectures. By unifying finite-state principles with deep learning, NFSM offers a robust path toward consistent, long-term surgical video analysis.

Title: CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding
Authors: Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Synesthesia of Machine (SoM)-Driven Analog Precoder Optimization for Enhanced ISAC Performance in Sub-THz Systems
Authors: Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is anticipated to be widely used in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. With the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation characteristics of sub-THz channels, ISAC transmitter design largely parallels analog precoder optimization. However, balancing both sensing and communication functionalities is challenging due to the beam squint effect in sub-THz systems, limiting ISAC performance gains. To overcome this, the unique design flexibility of sub-THz analog hardware is explored to better adapt to the electromagnetic characteristics of sub-THz channels. It is demonstrated that adjusting the equivalent channel through the analog precoder enhances dual-functional gains. Based on this, a near-optimal benchmark for analog precoder optimization is proposed. To address excessive algorithmic complexity, inspiration is drawn from the synesthesia of machine (SoM) to develop a lightweight complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net). This network reduces complexity by utilizing both communication and sensing channel data, with an architecture tailored to specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through simulations.

Title: Interference-Robust Broadband Rapidly-Varying MIMO Communications: A Knowledge-Data Dual Driven Framework
Authors: Jingjing Zhao, Jing Su, Kaiquan Cai, Yanbo Zhu, Yuanwei Liu, Naofal Al-Dhahir
Abstract: A novel time-efficient framework is proposed for improving the robustness of a broadband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system against unknown interference under rapidly-varying channels. A mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated by optimizing the beamformers employed. Since the unknown interference statistics are the premise for solving the formulated problem, an interference statistics tracking (IST) module is first designed. The IST module exploits both the time- and spatial-domain correlations of the interference-plus-noise (IPN) covariance for the future predictions with data training. Compared to the conventional signal-free space sampling approach, the IST module can realize zero-pilot and low-latency estimation. Subsequently, an interference-resistant hybrid beamforming (IR-HBF) module is presented, which incorporates both the prior knowledge of the theoretical optimization method as well as the data-fed training. Taking advantage of the interpretable network structure, the IR-HBF module enables the simplified mapping from the interference statistics to the beamforming weights. The simulations are executed in high-mobility scenarios, where the numerical results unveil that: 1) the proposed IST module attains promising prediction accuracy compared to the conventional counterparts under different snapshot sampling errors; and 2) the proposed IR-HBF module achieves lower MSE with significantly reduced computational complexity.

Authors: Runci Bai, Guibao Xu, Yanze Shi
Abstract: Brain tumors can lead to neurological dysfunction, cognitive and psychological changes, increased intracranial pressure, and seizures, posing significant risks to health. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) series has shown superior accuracy in medical imaging object detection. This paper presents a novel SCC-YOLO architecture that integrates the SCConv module into YOLOv9. The SCConv module optimizes convolutional efficiency by reducing spatial and channel redundancy, enhancing image feature learning. We examine the effects of different attention mechanisms with YOLOv9 for brain tumor detection using the Br35H dataset and our custom dataset (Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Results indicate that SCC-YOLO improved mAP50 by 0.3% on the Br35H dataset and by 0.5% on our custom dataset compared to YOLOv9. SCC-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor detection.

Title: QoE-oriented Communication Service Provision for Annotation Rendering in Mobile Augmented Reality
Authors: Lulu Sun, Conghao Zhou, Shisheng Hu, Yupeng Zhu, Nan Cheng, Xu Xia
Abstract: As mobile augmented reality (MAR) continues to evolve, future 6G networks will play a pivotal role in supporting immersive and personalized user experiences. In this paper, we address the communication service provision problem for annotation rendering in edge-assisted MAR, with the objective of optimizing spectrum resource utilization while ensuring the required quality of experience (QoE) for MAR users. To overcome the challenges of user-specific uplink data traffic patterns and the complex operational mechanisms of annotation rendering, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based approach. We first design a DT specifically tailored for MAR applications to learn key annotation rendering mechanisms, enabling the network controller to access MAR application-specific information. Then, we develop a DT based QoE modeling approach to capture the unique relationship between individual user QoE and spectrum resource demands. Finally, we propose a QoE-oriented resource allocation algorithm that decreases resource utilization compared to conventional net work slicing-based approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that our DT-based approach outperforms benchmark approaches in the accuracy and granularity of QoE modeling.

Title: Hybrid Near-Field and Far-Field Localization with Multiple Holographic MIMO Surfaces
Authors: Mengyuan Cao
Abstract: Localization methods based on holographic multiple input multiple output (HMIMO) have gained much attention for its potential to achieve high accuracy. By deploying multiple HMIMOs, we can improve the link quality and system coverage. As the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the near-field (NF) region of each HMIMO expands. However, existing multiple HMIMO-enabled methods mainly focus on the far-field (FF) of each HMIMO, which leads to low localization accuracy when applied in the NF. In this paper, a hybrid NF and FF localization method aided by multiple RISs, a low cost implementation of HMIMO, is proposed. In such a scenario, it is difficult to achieve user localization and RIS optimization since the equivalent NF of all RISs expands, which results in high complexity, and we need to handle the interference caused by multiple RISs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-phase RIS-enabled localization method that first estimate the relative locations of the user to each RIS and fuse the results to obtain the global estimation. In this way, the algorithm complexity is reduced. We formulate the RIS optimization problem to keep the RIS sidelobe as low as possible to minimize the interference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.

Title: Integration of Prior Knowledge into Direct Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Amir Modares, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.

Abstract: ASVspoof 5 is the fifth edition in a series of challenges which promote the study of speech spoofing and deepfake attacks as well as the design of detection solutions. We introduce the ASVspoof 5 database which is generated in crowdsourced fashion from data collected in diverse acoustic conditions (cf. studio-quality data for earlier ASVspoof databases) and from ~2,000 speakers (cf. ~100 earlier). The database contains attacks generated with 32 different algorithms, also crowdsourced, and optimised to varying degrees using new surrogate detection models. Among them are attacks generated with a mix of legacy and contemporary text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion models, in addition to adversarial attacks which are incorporated for the first time. ASVspoof 5 protocols comprise seven speaker-disjoint partitions. They include two distinct partitions for the training of different sets of attack models, two more for the development and evaluation of surrogate detection models, and then three additional partitions which comprise the ASVspoof 5 training, development and evaluation sets. An auxiliary set of data collected from an additional 30k speakers can also be used to train speaker encoders for the implementation of attack algorithms. Also described herein is an experimental validation of the new ASVspoof 5 database using a set of automatic speaker verification and spoof/deepfake baseline detectors. With the exception of protocols and tools for the generation of spoofed/deepfake speech, the resources described in this paper, already used by participants of the ASVspoof 5 challenge in 2024, are now all freely available to the community.

Title: A MIMO Wireless Channel Foundation Model via CIR-CSI Consistency
Authors: Jun Jiang, Wenjun Yu, Yunfan Li, Yuan Gao, Shugong Xu
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, self-supervised learning has demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets for pretraining, which is especially critical for wireless communication models to adapt to a variety of scenarios. This paper innovatively treats Channel State Information (CSI) and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as naturally aligned multi-modal data and proposes the first MIMO wireless channel foundation model, named CSI-CLIP. By effectively capturing the joint representations of both CIR and CSI, CSI-CLIP exhibits remarkable adaptability across scenarios and robust feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results show that in positioning task, CSI-CLIP reduces the mean error distance by 22%; in beam management task, it increases accuracy by 1% compared to traditional supervised methods, as well as in the channel identification task. These improvements not only highlight the potential and value of CSI-CLIP in integrating sensing and communication but also demonstrate its significant advantages over existing techniques. Moreover, viewing CSI and CIR as multi-modal pairs and contrastive learning for wireless channel foundation model open up new research directions in the domain of MIMO wireless communications.

Title: An Attention-Assisted Multi-Modal Data Fusion Model for Real-Time Estimation of Underwater Sound Velocity
Authors: Pengfei Wu, Wei Huang, Yujie Shi, Hao Zhang
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators
Authors: Momammad Ali Ranjbar
Abstract: Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.

Title: Cost-Effective Single-Antenna RSSI Positioning Through Dynamic Radiation Pattern Analysis
Authors: Zhisheng Rong, Wenzhi Liu, Xiayue Liu, Zhixiang Xu, Yufei Jiang, Xu Zhu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel indoor positioning approach that leverages antenna radiation pattern characteristics through Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements in a single-antenna system. By rotating the antenna or reconfiguring its radiation pattern, we derive a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm that achieves near-optimal positioning accuracy approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Through theoretical analysis, we establish three fundamental theorems characterizing the estimation accuracy bounds and demonstrating how performance improves with increased signal-to-noise ratio, antenna rotation count, and radiation pattern variations. Additionally, we propose a two-position measurement strategy that eliminates dependence on receiving antenna patterns. Simulation results validate that our approach provides an effective solution for indoor robot tracking applications where both accuracy and system simplicity are essential considerations.

Title: Interpretable Data-Driven Ship Dynamics Model: Enhancing Physics-Based Motion Prediction with Parameter Optimization
Authors: Christos Papandreou, Michail Mathioudakis, Theodoros Stouraitis, Petros Iatropoulos, Antonios Nikitakis, Stavros Paschalakis, Konstantinos Kyriakopoulos
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous navigation systems on ships necessitates accurate motion prediction models tailored to individual vessels. Traditional physics-based models, while grounded in hydrodynamic principles, often fail to account for ship-specific behaviors under real-world conditions. Conversely, purely data-driven models offer specificity but lack interpretability and robustness in edge cases. This study proposes a data-driven physics-based model that integrates physics-based equations with data-driven parameter optimization, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to ensure interpretability and adaptability. The model incorporates physics-based components such as 3-DoF dynamics, rudder, and propeller forces, while parameters such as resistance curve and rudder coefficients are optimized using synthetic data. By embedding domain knowledge into the parameter optimization process, the fitted model maintains physical consistency. Validation of the approach is realized with two container ships by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, predictions against ground-truth trajectories. The results demonstrate significant improvements, in predictive accuracy and reliability, of the data-driven physics-based models over baseline physics-based models tuned with traditional marine engineering practices. The fitted models capture ship-specific behaviors in diverse conditions with their predictions being, 51.6% (ship A) and 57.8% (ship B) more accurate, 72.36% (ship A) and 89.67% (ship B) more consistent.

Authors: Kaveen Perera, Fouad Khelifi, Ammar Belatreche
Abstract: This article presents an extended author's version based on our previous work, where we introduced the Multiple Overlapping Tiles (MOT) method for palm vein image enhancement. To better reflect the specific operations involved, we rename MOT to ILACS-LGOT (Intensity-Limited Adaptive Contrast Stretching with Layered Gaussian-weighted Overlapping Tiles). This revised terminology more accurately represents the method's approach to contrast enhancement and blocky effect mitigation. Additionally, this article provides a more detailed analysis, including expanded evaluations, graphical representations, and sample-based comparisons, demonstrating the effectiveness of ILACS-LGOT over existing methods.

Title: Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment
Authors: Ruiqi Wang, Pinjun Zheng, Vijith Varma Kotte, Sakandar Rauf, Yiming Yang, Muhammad Mahboob Ur Rahman, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Atif Shamim
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. A low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate hardware prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally verified through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, indoor communication trials are conducted via a pair of software-defined radios which demonstrate superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype. This work presents the first demonstration of a liquid-based ER-FAS in array configuration for enhancing communication systems.

Title: Dynamics on Lie groups with applications to attitude estimation
Authors: T. Forrest Kieffer, Michael Wall
Abstract: The problem of filtering - propagation of states through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and association of measurement data using Bayesian inference - in a state space which forms a Lie group is considered. Particular emphasis is given to concentrated Gaussians (CGs) as a parametric family of probability distributions to capture the uncertainty associated with an estimated state. The so-called group-affine property of the state evolution is shown to be necessary and sufficient for linearity of the dynamics on the associated Lie algebra, in turn implying CGs are invariant under such evolution. A putative SDE on the group is then reformulated as an SDE on the associated Lie algebra. The vector space structure of the Lie algebra together with the notion of a CG enables the leveraging of techniques from conventional Gaussian-based Kalman filtering in an approach called the tangent space filter (TSF). We provide example calculations for several Lie groups that arise in the problem of estimating position, velocity, and orientation of a rigid body from a noisy, potentially biased inertial measurement unit (IMU). For the specific problem of attitude estimation, numerical experiments demonstrate that TSF-based approaches are more accurate and robust than another widely used attitude filtering technique.

Title: Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning
Authors: Iman Askari, Ali Vaziri, Xumein Tu, Shen Zeng, Huazhen Fang
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.

Title: Developing a Multilingual Dataset and Evaluation Metrics for Code-Switching: A Focus on Hong Kong's Polylingual Dynamics
Authors: Peng Xie, Kani Chen
Abstract: The existing audio datasets are predominantly tailored towards single languages, overlooking the complex linguistic behaviors of multilingual communities that engage in code-switching. This practice, where individuals frequently mix two or more languages in their daily interactions, is particularly prevalent in multilingual regions such as Hong Kong, China. To bridge this gap, we have developed a 34.8-hour dataset of Mixed Cantonese and English (MCE) audio using our Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework (MADGF). We fine-tuned the open-source multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, with the MCE dataset, leading to impressive zero-shot performance. The traditional metrics overlook important factors such as latency in real-world applications and code-switching scenarios. We have introduced a novel evaluation metric called Fidelity to the Original Audio, Accuracy, and Latency (FAL). This metric aims to overcome the limitations of traditional metrics used to assess ASR systems.

Authors: Ruohao Guo, Xianghua Ying, Yaru Chen, Dantong Niu, Guangyao Li, Liao Qu, Yanyu Qi, Jinxing Zhou, Bowei Xing, Wenzhen Yue, Ji Shi, Qixun Wang, Peiliang Zhang, Buwen Liang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models. Unfortunately, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding. Dataset and code is available at this https URL.

Title: Robust Stability of Neural Network Control Systems with Interval Matrix Uncertainties
Authors: Yuhao Zhang, Xiangru Xu
Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in controller design due to their versatility and efficiency. However, their integration into feedback systems can pose stability challenges, particularly in the presence of uncertainties. This work addresses the problem of certifying robust stability in neural network control systems with interval matrix uncertainties. Leveraging classical robust stability techniques and the quadratic constraint-based method to characterize the input-output behavior of neural networks, we derive novel robust stability certificates formulated as linear matrix inequalities. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce three relaxed sufficient conditions and establish their equivalence in terms of feasibility. Additionally, we explore their connections to existing robust stability results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through inverted pendulum and mass-spring-damper examples.

Title: Fréchet Wavelet Distance: A Domain-Agnostic Metric for Image Generation
Authors: Lokesh Veeramacheneni (University of Bonn), Moritz Wolter (University of Bonn), Hildegard Kuehne (University of Tuebingen, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab), Juergen Gall (University of Bonn, Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence)
Abstract: Modern metrics for generative learning like Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and DINOv2-Fréchet Distance (FD-DINOv2) demonstrate impressive performance. However, they suffer from various shortcomings, like a bias towards specific generators and datasets. To address this problem, we propose the Fréchet Wavelet Distance (FWD) as a domain-agnostic metric based on the Wavelet Packet Transform ($W_p$). FWD provides a sight across a broad spectrum of frequencies in images with a high resolution, preserving both spatial and textural aspects. Specifically, we use $W_p$ to project generated and real images to the packet coefficient space. We then compute the Fréchet distance with the resultant coefficients to evaluate the quality of a generator. This metric is general-purpose and dataset-domain agnostic, as it does not rely on any pre-trained network, while being more interpretable due to its ability to compute Fréchet distance per packet, enhancing transparency. We conclude with an extensive evaluation of a wide variety of generators across various datasets that the proposed FWD can generalize and improve robustness to domain shifts and various corruptions compared to other metrics.

Title: Analytical Framework for Effective Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field XL-MIMO
Authors: Zhe Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Wenhui Yi, Huahua Xiao, Hongyang Du, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is an emerging transceiver technology for enabling next-generation communication systems, due to its potential for substantial enhancement in both the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution. However, the achievable performance limits of various promising XL-MIMO configurations have yet to be fully evaluated, compared, and discussed. In this paper, we develop an effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) performance analysis framework specifically tailored for near-field XL-MIMO systems. We explore five representative distinct XL-MIMO hardware designs, including uniform planar array (UPA)-based with infinitely thin dipoles, two-dimensional (2D) continuous aperture (CAP) plane-based, UPA-based with patch antennas, uniform linear array (ULA)-based, and one-dimensional (1D) CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO systems. Our analysis encompasses two near-field channel models: the scalar and dyadic Green's function-based channel models. More importantly, when applying the scalar Green's function-based channel, we derive EDoF expressions in the closed-form, characterizing the impacts of the physical size of the transceiver, the transmitting distance, and the carrier frequency. In our numerical results, we evaluate and compare the EDoF performance across all examined XL-MIMO designs, confirming the accuracy of our proposed closed-form expressions. Furthermore, we observe that with an increasing number of antennas, the EDoF performance for both UPA-based and ULA-based systems approaches that of 2D CAP plane and 1D CAP line segment-based systems, respectively. Moreover, we unveil that the EDoF performance for near-field XL-MIMO systems is predominantly determined by the array aperture size rather than the sheer number of antennas.

Title: Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs
Authors: Bohan Tang, Zexi Liu, Keyue Jiang, Siheng Chen, Xiaowen Dong
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.

Title: Offline Learning of Decision Functions in Multiplayer Games with Expectation Constraints
Authors: Yuanhanqing Huang, Jianghai Hu
Abstract: We explore a class of stochastic multiplayer games where each player in the game aims to optimize its objective under uncertainty and adheres to some expectation constraints. The study employs an offline learning paradigm, leveraging a pre-existing dataset containing auxiliary features. While prior research in deterministic and stochastic multiplayer games primarily explored vector-valued decisions, this work departs by considering function-valued decisions that incorporate auxiliary features as input. We leverage the law of large deviations and degree theory to establish the almost sure convergence of the offline learning solution to the true solution as the number of data samples increases. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our method via a multi-account portfolio optimization problem.

Title: On A Class of Greedy Sparse Recovery Algorithms
Authors: Gang Li, Qiuwei Li, Shuang Li, Wu Angela Li
Abstract: Sparse signal recovery deals with finding the sparest solution of an under-determined linear system $x = Q s$. In this paper, we propose a novel greedy approach to addressing the challenges from such a problem. Such an approach is based on a characterization of solutions to the system, which allows us to work on the sparse recovery in the $s$-space directly with a given measure. With $l_2$-based measure, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-type algorithm is proposed, which significantly outperforms the classical OMP algorithm in terms of recovery accuracy while maintaining comparable computational complexity. An $l_1$-based algorithm, denoted as $\text{Alg}_{GL1}$, is derived. Such an algorithm significantly outperforms the classical basis pursuit (BP) algorithm. Combining with the CoSaMP-strategy for selecting atoms, a class of high performance greedy algorithms is also derived. Extensive numerical simulations on both synthetic and image data are carried out, with which the superior performance of our proposed algorithms is demonstrated in terms of sparse recovery accuracy and robustness against numerical instability of the system matrix $Q$ and disturbance in the measurement $x$.

Title: Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nyström method
Authors: Edoardo Caldarelli, Antoine Chatalic, Adrià Colomé, Cesare Molinari, Carlos Ocampo-Martinez, Carme Torras, Lorenzo Rosasco
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nyström approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nyström approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.

Title: Tight Bounds on Polynomials and Its Application to Dynamic Optimization Problems
Authors: Eduardo M. G. Vila, Eric C. Kerrigan, Paul Bruce
Abstract: This paper presents a pseudo-spectral method for Dynamic Optimization Problems (DOPs) that allows for tight polynomial bounds to be achieved via flexible sub-intervals. The proposed method not only rigorously enforces inequality constraints, but also allows for a lower cost in comparison with non-flexible discretizations. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method to solve optimal control problems. Solutions to the example problems exhibited up to a tenfold reduction in relative cost.

Title: An Effective Automated Speaking Assessment Approach to Mitigating Data Scarcity and Imbalanced Distribution
Authors: Tien-Hong Lo, Fu-An Chao, Tzu-I Wu, Yao-Ting Sung, Berlin Chen
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) typically involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) and hand-crafted feature extraction from the ASR transcript of a learner's speech. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown stellar performance compared to traditional methods. However, SSL-based ASA systems are faced with at least three data-related challenges: limited annotated data, uneven distribution of learner proficiency levels and non-uniform score intervals between different CEFR proficiency levels. To address these challenges, we explore the use of two novel modeling strategies: metric-based classification and loss reweighting, leveraging distinct SSL-based embedding features. Extensive experimental results on the ICNALE benchmark dataset suggest that our approach can outperform existing strong baselines by a sizable margin, achieving a significant improvement of more than 10% in CEFR prediction accuracy.

Title: Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents
Authors: Chinmay Maheshwari, Kshitij Kulkarni, Manxi Wu, Shankar Sastry
Abstract: We propose an adaptive incentive mechanism that learns the optimal incentives in environments where players continuously update their strategies. Our mechanism updates incentives based on each player's externality, defined as the difference between the player's marginal cost and the operator's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the players' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by players to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions under which the adaptive mechanism converges to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant classes of games: atomic aggregative games and non-atomic routing games.

Title: Multi-objective Representation for Numbers in Clinical Narratives: A CamemBERT-Bio-Based Alternative to Large-Scale LLMs
Authors: Boammani Aser Lompo, Thanh-Dung Le
Abstract: The processing of numerical values is a rapidly developing area in the field of Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous advancements achieved by previous research, significant challenges persist, particularly within the healthcare domain. This paper investigates the limitations of Transformer models in understanding numerical values. \textit{Objective:} this research aims to categorize numerical values extracted from medical documents into eight specific physiological categories using CamemBERT-bio. \textit{Methods:} In a context where scalable methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) are emphasized, we explore lifting the limitations of transformer-based models. We examine two strategies: fine-tuning CamemBERT-bio on a small medical dataset, integrating Label Embedding for Self-Attention (LESA), and combining LESA with additional enhancement techniques such as Xval. Given that CamemBERT-bio is already pre-trained on a large medical dataset, the first approach aims to update its encoder with the newly added label embeddings technique. In contrast, the second approach seeks to develop multiple representations of numbers (contextual and magnitude-based) to achieve more robust number embeddings. \textit{Results:} As anticipated, fine-tuning the standard CamemBERT-bio on our small medical dataset did not improve F1 scores. However, significant improvements were observed with CamemBERT-bio + LESA, resulting in an over 13\% increase. Similar enhancements were noted when combining LESA with Xval, outperforming conventional methods and giving comparable results to GPT-4 \textit{Conclusions and Novelty:} This study introduces two innovative techniques for handling numerical data, which are also applicable to other modalities. We illustrate how these techniques can improve the performance of Transformer-based models, achieving more reliable classification results even with small datasets.

Title: Contrastive Learning from Synthetic Audio Doppelgängers
Authors: Manuel Cherep, Nikhil Singh
Abstract: Learning robust audio representations currently demands extensive datasets of real-world sound recordings. By applying artificial transformations to these recordings, models can learn to recognize similarities despite subtle variations through techniques like contrastive learning. However, these transformations are only approximations of the true diversity found in real-world sounds, which are generated by complex interactions of physical processes, from vocal cord vibrations to the resonance of musical instruments. We propose a solution to both the data scale and transformation limitations, leveraging synthetic audio. By randomly perturbing the parameters of a sound synthesizer, we generate audio doppelgängers-synthetic positive pairs with causally manipulated variations in timbre, pitch, and temporal envelopes. These variations, difficult to achieve through augmentations of existing audio, provide a rich source of contrastive information. Despite the shift to randomly generated synthetic data, our method produces strong representations, outperforming real data on several standard audio classification tasks. Notably, our approach is lightweight, requires no data storage, and has only a single hyperparameter, which we extensively analyze. We offer this method as a complement to existing strategies for contrastive learning in audio, using synthesized sounds to reduce the data burden on practitioners.

Title: Large Language Model(LLM) assisted End-to-End Network Health Management based on Multi-Scale Semanticization
Authors: Fengxiao Tang, Xiaonan Wang, Xun Yuan, Linfeng Luo, Ming Zhao, Tianchi Huang, Nei Kato
Abstract: Network device and system health management is the foundation of modern network operations and maintenance. Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.

Title: Computationally Efficient RL under Linear Bellman Completeness for Deterministic Dynamics
Authors: Runzhe Wu, Ayush Sekhari, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Wen Sun
Abstract: We study computationally and statistically efficient Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the linear Bellman Complete setting. This setting uses linear function approximation to capture value functions and unifies existing models like linear Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). While it is known from the prior works that this setting is statistically tractable, it remained open whether a computationally efficient algorithm exists. Our work provides a computationally efficient algorithm for the linear Bellman complete setting that works for MDPs with large action spaces, random initial states, and random rewards but relies on the underlying dynamics to be deterministic. Our approach is based on randomization: we inject random noise into least squares regression problems to perform optimistic value iteration. Our key technical contribution is to carefully design the noise to only act in the null space of the training data to ensure optimism while circumventing a subtle error amplification issue.

Title: Modeling Unknown Stochastic Dynamical System Subject to External Excitation
Authors: Yuan Chen, Dongbin Xiu
Abstract: We present a numerical method for learning unknown nonautonomous stochastic dynamical system, i.e., stochastic system subject to time dependent excitation or control signals. Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.

Title: Fish Tracking, Counting, and Behaviour Analysis in Digital Aquaculture: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Meng Cui, Xubo Liu, Haohe Liu, Jinzheng Zhao, Daoliang Li, Wenwu Wang
Abstract: Digital aquaculture leverages advanced technologies and data-driven methods, providing substantial benefits over traditional aquaculture practices. This paper presents a comprehensive review of three interconnected digital aquaculture tasks, namely, fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis, using a novel and unified approach. Unlike previous reviews which focused on single modalities or individual tasks, we analyse vision-based (i.e. image- and video-based), acoustic-based, and biosensor-based methods across all three tasks. We examine their advantages, limitations, and applications, highlighting recent advancements and identifying critical cross-cutting research gaps. The review also includes emerging ideas such as applying multi-task learning and large language models to address various aspects of fish monitoring, an approach not previously explored in aquaculture literature. We identify the major obstacles hindering research progress in this field, including the scarcity of comprehensive fish datasets and the lack of unified evaluation standards. To overcome the current limitations, we explore the potential of using emerging technologies such as multimodal data fusion and deep learning to improve the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of integrated fish monitoring systems. In addition, we provide a summary of existing datasets available for fish tracking, counting, and behaviour analysis. This holistic perspective offers a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for comprehensive datasets and evaluation standards to facilitate meaningful comparisons between technologies and to promote their practical implementations in real-world settings.

Title: Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications
Authors: Ziqing Wang, Timothy C. Ralph, Ryan Aguinaldo, Robert Malaney
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.

Title: Delay-Aware Robust Edge Network Hardening Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty
Authors: Jiaming Cheng, Duong Thuy Anh Nguyen, Ni Trieu, Duong Tung Nguyen
Abstract: Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge. For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality. These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters. Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience. To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty. Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays. However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties. We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form. Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection
Authors: Sean Moushegian, Suya Wu, Enmao Diao, Jie Ding, Taposh Banerjee, Vahid Tarokh
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work employs a pair of "least-favorable" distributions to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.

Title: Hybrid STAR-RIS Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Zehra Yigit, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for local communication users and sensing targets situated within the same physical region as the base station (BS), while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for distant communication users and sensing targets situated far from of the coverage area of the BS. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate communication and sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.

Title: Learning with Linear Function Approximations in Mean-Field Control
Authors: Erhan Bayraktar, Ali D. Kara
Abstract: The paper focuses on mean-field type multi-agent control problems with finite state and action spaces where the dynamics and cost structures are symmetric and homogeneous, and are affected by the distribution of the agents. A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.

Title: Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier
Authors: Hossein Jafarinia, Alireza Alipanah, Danial Hamdi, Saeed Razavi, Nahal Mirzaie, Mohammad Hossein Rohban
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on this https URL.

Title: Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound
Authors: Junwon Lee, Jaekwon Im, Dabin Kim, Juhan Nam
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (this https URL)

Title: LLaMA-Omni: Seamless Speech Interaction with Large Language Models
Authors: Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Yan Zhou, Zhengrui Ma, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng
Abstract: Models like GPT-4o enable real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, significantly enhancing user experience compared to traditional text-based interaction. However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.

Title: Compositional Audio Representation Learning
Authors: Sripathi Sridhar, Mark Cartwright
Abstract: Human auditory perception is compositional in nature -- we identify auditory streams from auditory scenes with multiple sound events. However, such auditory scenes are typically represented using clip-level representations that do not disentangle the constituent sound sources. In this work, we learn source-centric audio representations where each sound source is represented using a distinct, disentangled source embedding in the audio representation. We propose two novel approaches to learning source-centric audio representations: a supervised model guided by classification and an unsupervised model guided by feature reconstruction, both of which outperform the baselines. We thoroughly evaluate the design choices of both approaches using an audio classification task. We find that supervision is beneficial to learn source-centric representations, and that reconstructing audio features is more useful than reconstructing spectrograms to learn unsupervised source-centric representations. Leveraging source-centric models can help unlock the potential of greater interpretability and more flexible decoding in machine listening.

Title: Guaranteed Reach-Avoid for Black-Box Systems through Narrow Gaps via Neural Network Reachability
Authors: Long Kiu Chung, Wonsuhk Jung, Srivatsank Pullabhotla, Parth Shinde, Yadu Sunil, Saihari Kota, Luis Felipe Wolf Batista, Cédric Pradalier, Shreyas Kousik
Abstract: In the classical reach-avoid problem, autonomous mobile robots are tasked to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. However, it is difficult to provide guarantees on the robot's performance when the obstacles form a narrow gap and the robot is a black-box (i.e. the dynamics are not known analytically, but interacting with the system is cheap). To address this challenge, this paper presents NeuralPARC. The method extends the authors' prior Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to systems modeled by rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks, which are trained to represent parameterized trajectory data demonstrated by the robot. NeuralPARC computes the reachable set of the network while accounting for modeling error, and returns a set of states and parameters with which the black-box system is guaranteed to reach the goal and avoid obstacles. NeuralPARC is shown to outperform PARC, generating provably-safe extreme vehicle drift parking maneuvers in simulations and in real life on a model car, as well as enabling safety on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subjected to large disturbances and controlled by a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

Title: $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ Adaptive Optimizer for Online Time-Varying Convex Optimization
Authors: Jinrae Kim, Naira Hovakimyan
Abstract: We propose an adaptive method for online time-varying (TV) convex optimization, termed $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive optimization ($\mathcal{L}_{1}$-AO). TV optimizers utilize a prediction model to exploit the temporal structure of TV problems, which can be inaccurate in the online implementation. Inspired by $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive control, the proposed method augments an adaptive update law to estimate and compensate for the uncertainty from the prediction inaccuracies. The proposed method provides performance bounds of the error in the optimization variables and cost function, allowing efficient and reliable optimization for TV problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for online TV convex optimization.

Title: MoCoLSK: Modality Conditioned High-Resolution Downscaling for Land Surface Temperature
Authors: Qun Dai, Chunyang Yuan, Yimian Dai, Yuxuan Li, Xiang Li, Kang Ni, Jianhui Xu, Xiangbo Shu, Jian Yang
Abstract: Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for environmental studies, but directly obtaining high spatial resolution LST data remains challenging due to the spatio-temporal trade-off in satellite remote sensing. Guided LST downscaling has emerged as an alternative solution to overcome these limitations, but current methods often neglect spatial non-stationarity, and there is a lack of an open-source ecosystem for deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose the Modality-Conditional Large Selective Kernel (MoCoLSK) Network, a novel architecture that dynamically fuses multi-modal data through modality-conditioned projections. MoCoLSK achieves a confluence of dynamic receptive field adjustment and multi-modal feature fusion, leading to enhanced LST prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we establish the GrokLST project, a comprehensive open-source ecosystem featuring the GrokLST dataset, a high-resolution benchmark, and the GrokLST toolkit, an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit encapsulating MoCoLSK alongside 40+ state-of-the-art approaches. Extensive experimental results validate MoCoLSK's effectiveness in capturing complex dependencies and subtle variations within multispectral data, outperforming existing methods in LST downscaling.

Title: Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data
Authors: Shahrokh Hamidi
Abstract: The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.

Title: A Universal Formulation for Path-Parametric Planning and Control
Authors: Jon Arrizabalaga, Zbyněk ŠÍR, Zachary Manchester, Markus Ryll
Abstract: We present a unified framework for path-parametric planning and control. This formulation is universal as it standardizes the entire spectrum of path-parametric techniques -- from traditional path following to more recent contouring or progress-maximizing Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning -- under a single framework. The ingredients underlying this universality are twofold: First, we present a compact and efficient technique capable of computing singularity-free, smooth and differentiable moving frames. Second, we derive a spatial path parameterization of the Cartesian coordinates for any arbitrary curve without prior assumptions on its parametric speed or moving frame, and that perfectly interplays with the aforementioned path parameterization method. The combination of these two ingredients leads to a planning and control framework that unites existing path-parametric techniques in literature.

Title: Sylber: Syllabic Embedding Representation of Speech from Raw Audio
Authors: Cheol Jun Cho, Nicholas Lee, Akshat Gupta, Dhruv Agarwal, Ethan Chen, Alan W Black, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Syllables are compositional units of spoken language that efficiently structure human speech perception and production. However, current neural speech representations lack such structure, resulting in dense token sequences that are costly to process. To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber, that produces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that bootstraps syllabic embeddings by distilling from its own initial unsupervised syllabic segmentation. This results in a highly structured representation of speech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast, linear-time syllable segmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization with an average of 4.27 tokens per second, and 3) novel phonological units suited for efficient spoken language modeling. Our proposed segmentation method is highly robust and generalizes to out-of-domain data and unseen languages without any tuning. By training token-to-speech generative models, fully intelligible speech can be reconstructed from Sylber tokens with a significantly lower bitrate than baseline SSL tokens. This suggests that our model effectively compresses speech into a compact sequence of tokens with minimal information loss. Lastly, we demonstrate that categorical perception-a linguistic phenomenon in speech perception-emerges naturally in Sylber, making the embedding space more categorical and sparse than previous speech features and thus supporting the high efficiency of our tokenization. Together, we present a novel SSL approach for representing speech as syllables, with significant potential for efficient speech tokenization and spoken language modeling.

Title: A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction
Authors: Zhouheng Li, Bei Zhou, Cheng Hu, Lei Xie, Hongye Su
Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits.

Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of optimal ground station selection for low-Earth orbiting (LEO) space missions that enables mission operators to precisely design their ground segment performance and costs. Space mission operators are increasingly turning to Ground-Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers to supply the terrestrial communications segment to reduce costs and increase network size. However, this approach leads to a new challenge of selecting the optimal service providers and station locations for a given mission. We consider the problem of ground station selection as an optimization problem and present a general solution framework that allows mission designers to set their overall optimization objective and constrain key mission performance variables such as total data downlink, total mission cost, recurring operational cost, and maximum communications time-gap. We solve the problem using integer programming (IP). To address computational scaling challenges, we introduce a surrogate optimization approach where the optimal station selection is determined based on solving the problem over a reduced time domain. Two different IP formulations are evaluated using randomized selections of LEO satellites of varying constellation sizes. We consider the networks of the commercial GSaaS providers Atlas Space Operations, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station, Azure Orbital Ground Station, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Leaf Space, and Viasat Real-Time Earth. We compare our results against standard operational practices of integrating with one or two primary ground station providers.

Abstract: Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics. However, current tools including genomic assays lack the accuracy required for optimal clinical decision-making. We developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that integrates digital pathology images with clinical data, providing a more robust and effective method for predicting the risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 female breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five evaluation cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p<0.001]). In a direct comparison (n=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, achieving a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent prognostic information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p<0.001)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across major molecular breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test improves upon the accuracy of existing prognostic tests, while being applicable to a wider range of patients.

Title: Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control
Authors: Hansung Kim, Edward L. Zhu, Chang Seok Lim, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.

Title: Long-Term EEG Partitioning for Seizure Onset Detection
Authors: Zheng Chen, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai, Jimeng Sun
Abstract: Deep learning models have recently shown great success in classifying epileptic patients using EEG recordings. Unfortunately, classification-based methods lack a sound mechanism to detect the onset of seizure events. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework, SODor, that explicitly models seizure onset through a novel task formulation of subsequence clustering. Given an EEG sequence, the framework first learns a set of second-level embeddings with label supervision. It then employs model-based clustering to explicitly capture long-term temporal dependencies in EEG sequences and identify meaningful subsequences. Epochs within a subsequence share a common cluster assignment (normal or seizure), with cluster or state transitions representing successful onset detections. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method can correct misclassifications, achieving 5\%-11\% classification improvements over other baselines and accurately detecting seizure onsets.

Title: A Multi-modal Approach to Dysarthria Detection and Severity Assessment Using Speech and Text Information
Authors: M Anuprabha, Krishna Gurugubelli, V Kesavaraj, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Automatic detection and severity assessment of dysarthria are crucial for delivering targeted therapeutic interventions to patients. While most existing research focuses primarily on speech modality, this study introduces a novel approach that leverages both speech and text modalities. By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.

Title: Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space
Authors: Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Ullrich J. Mönich, Fan Liu, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.

Title: Sample Complexity of Linear Quadratic Regulator Without Initial Stability
Authors: Amirreza Neshaei Moghaddam, Alex Olshevsky, Bahman Gharesifard
Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown parameters. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riemannian distance over the Riccati operator. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results, demonstrating the method's practical feasibility and performance in realistic scenarios.

Title: Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs
Authors: Le Zhang, Quanling Zhao, Run Wang, Shirley Bian, Onat Gungor, Flavio Ponzina, Tajana Rosing
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Title: TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Giuseppe Paolo, Abdelhakim Benechehab, Hamza Cherkaoui, Albert Thomas, Balázs Kégl
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent this http URL enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.

Title: URO-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Models
Authors: Ruiqi Yan, Xiquan Li, Wenxi Chen, Zhikang Niu, Chen Yang, Ziyang Ma, Kai Yu, Xie Chen
Abstract: In recent years, with advances in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs) have made significant strides. Compared to text-based LLMs, the evaluation of SDMs needs to take speech-related aspects into account, such as paralinguistic information and speech quality. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To address this gap, we propose URO-Bench, an extensive benchmark for SDMs. Notably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is divided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, consisting of 16 and 20 datasets respectively, evaluating the model's abilities in Understanding, Reasoning, and Oral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed benchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA tasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in advanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding remains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. We hope that URO-Bench can effectively facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models by providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track progress in this area.
