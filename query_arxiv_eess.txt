Title: A Multi-Modal Spatial Risk Framework for EV Charging Infrastructure Using Remote Sensing
Authors: Oktay Karakuş, Padraig Corcoran
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover (LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

Title: Speaker Embeddings to Improve Tracking of Intermittent and Moving Speakers
Authors: Taous Iatariene (MULTISPEECH), Can Cui (MULTISPEECH), Alexandre Guérin, Romain Serizel (MULTISPEECH)
Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal. Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming and input duration for embedding extraction.

Title: MATER: Multi-level Acoustic and Textual Emotion Representation for Interpretable Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Hyo Jin Jon, Longbin Jin, Hyuntaek Jung, Hyunseo Kim, Donghun Min, Eun Yi Kim
Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of 0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of 0.6941.

Title: Revisiting R: Statistical Envelope Analysis for Lightweight RF Modulation Classification
Authors: Srinivas Rahul Sapireddy, Mostafizur Rahman
Abstract: Modulation classification plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems, enabling applications such as cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and electronic warfare. Conventional techniques often involve deep learning or complex feature extraction, which, while effective, require substantial computational resources and memory. An early approach by Chan and Gadbois in 1985 introduced a theoretical method for modulation classification using a mathematically derived parameter called R. The authors proved that the R value - the ratio of the variance to the square of the mean of the signal envelope - can be a distinguishing feature for classification. In this work, we revisit the R value and show that classification accuracy can be improved further through statistical methods. We extend R-value analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness even after signals are transformed using the Hilbert transform followed by the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Our analysis includes testing on 300000 signals across AM, DSB, and SSB classes, with each class having 100000 random variations. On average, we achieve 98.60, 97.30, and 97.90 percent classification accuracy for AM, DSB, and SSB signals after applying the Hilbert transform. Similar or better accuracies are observed after applying the STFT, reaching 98.80, 99.10, and 99.00 percent, respectively, for AM, DSB, and SSB types.

Title: Posterior Cramér-Rao Bounds on Localization and Mapping Errors in Distributed MIMO SLAM
Authors: Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann, Xuhong Li, Florian Meyer, Erik Leitinger
Abstract: Radio-frequency simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods jointly infer the position of mobile transmitters and receivers in wireless networks, together with a geometric map of the propagation environment. An inferred map of specular surfaces can be used to exploit non-line-of-sight components of the multipath channel to increase robustness, bypass obstructions, and improve overall communication and positioning performance. While performance bounds for user location are well established, the literature lacks performance bounds for map information. This paper derives the mapping error bound (MEB), i.e., the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound on the position and orientation of specular surfaces, for RF-SLAM. In particular, we consider a very general scenario with single- and double-bounce reflections, as well as distributed anchors. We demonstrate numerically that a state-of-the-art RF-SLAM algorithm asymptotically converges to this MEB. The bounds assess not only the localization (position and orientation) but also the mapping performance of RF-SLAM algorithms in terms of global features.

Title: VoxelOpt: Voxel-Adaptive Message Passing for Discrete Optimization in Deformable Abdominal CT Registration
Authors: Hang Zhang, Yuxi Zhang, Jiazheng Wang, Xiang Chen, Renjiu Hu, Xin Tian, Gaolei Li, Min Liu
Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations, we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.

Title: Improved Topology-Independent Distributed Adaptive Node-Specific Signal Estimation for Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks
Authors: Paul Didier, Toon van Waterschoot, Simon Doclo, Jörg Bitzer, Marc Moonen
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of topology-independent (TI) distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) in wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) where sensor nodes exchange only fused versions of their local signals. An algorithm named TI-DANSE has previously been presented to handle non-fully connected WASNs. However, its slow iterative convergence towards the optimal solution limits its applicability. To address this, we propose in this paper the TI-DANSE+ algorithm. At each iteration in TI-DANSE+, the node set to update its local parameters is allowed to exploit each individual partial in-network sums transmitted by its neighbors in its local estimation problem, increasing the available degrees of freedom and accelerating convergence with respect to TI-DANSE. Additionally, a tree-pruning strategy is proposed to further increase convergence speed. TI-DANSE+ converges as fast as the DANSE algorithm in fully connected WASNs while reducing transmit power usage. The convergence properties of TI-DANSE+ are demonstrated in numerical simulations.

Title: Recursive-ARX for Grid-Edge Fault Detection
Authors: Soufiane El Yaagoubi, Keith Moffat, Eduardo Prieto Araujo, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Future electrical grids will require new ways to identify faults as inverters are not capable of supplying large fault currents to support existing fault detection methods and because distributed resources may feed faults from the edge of the grid. This paper proposes the use of real-time system identification for online power-system fault detection. Specifically, we implement Recursive ARX (rARX) system identification on a grid-connected inverter. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed rARX method is able to both detect large faults quickly, and distinguish between high-impedance faults and large load increases. These results indicate that rARX grid-edge fault detection is a promising research direction for improving the reliability and safety of modern electric grids.

Title: Near-Field SWIPT Using XL-MIMO: Power Allocation and Subarray Activation
Authors: Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) capability of a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, in the context of power consumption (PC) efficiency. The network users are divided into two functional categories: information decoding (ID) users and energy harvesting (EH) users. Non-stationary near-field channels are considered whilst the users are located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs). We formulate a two-tier joint optimization problem to minimize the PC, taking into account the power allocation (PA) for ID and EH users, along with the activation of constituent XL-MIMO subarrays. This complicated mixed-integer problem is transformed into more tractable formulations and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving them. The numerical results demonstrate that the overall PC of the XL-MIMO system for the proposed method is reduced by more than 60% in comparison to the benchmark scheme of equal PA with full subarray activation (SA) and 30% against the case of optimized PA with full SA, while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on both the downlink rate of the ID users and harvested energy at the EH users.

Title: Near-Field Energy Harvesting Using XL-MIMO Over Non-Stationary Channels
Authors: Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: This paper explores the maximization of the harvested power efficiency (HPE) in a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, which supports energy harvesting (EH) for near-field users. These users are located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs) with non-stationary channel characteristics. We propose to determine which sub-arrays are switched on or off as well the power control coefficients at the sub-arrays to maximize the HPE. The design can be processed via a multi-tier joint optimization framework based on fractional programming. The numerical results showcase that the HPE performance of the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal, comparable to that of exhaustive search. As a matter of fact, it achieves up to a 120% gain over the benchmark scheme which uses the entire XL-MIMO array with equal power allocation (PA) across sub-arrays, while significantly reducing the computational time.

Title: Low-Complexity Ordered Reliability Direct Error Pattern Testing (ORDEPT) Decoding with Likelihood Thresholding
Authors: Reza Hadavian, Dmitri Truhachev
Abstract: We propose a reduced complexity approach to pattern-based soft decoding of block codes. We start from the ORDEPT decoding algorithm which tests a list of partial error patterns organized in the order of their likelihood and attempts to complete the patterns creating candidate codewords. We then propose an early termination criterion. Once a candidate codeword is found, its log-likelihood difference to the received sequence is compared to a preset threshold and the decoding decision is instantly made in case the likelihood deviation is below the threshold. We demonstrate that while keeping the same block error rate (BLER) performance, the proposed algorithm's latency and complexity is multiple times smaller than that of the state-of-the art competitors including the Chase II, ORBGRAND, GCD, and the very recent ORDEPT with Soft-Output GRAND termination which necessitates several multiplications in each query processing.

Title: Joint Quantization and Pruning Neural Networks Approach: A Case Study on FSO Receivers
Authors: Mohanad Obeed, Ming Jian
Abstract: Towards fast, hardware-efficient, and low-complexity receivers, we propose a compression-aware learning approach and examine it on free-space optical (FSO) receivers for turbulence mitigation. The learning approach jointly quantize, prune, and train a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we propose to have the CNN weights of power of two values so we replace the multiplication operations bit-shifting operations in every layer that has significant lower computational cost. The compression idea in the proposed approach is that the loss function is updated and both the quantization levels and the pruning limits are optimized in every epoch of training. The compressed CNN is examined for two levels of compression (1-bit and 2-bits) over different FSO systems. The numerical results show that the compression approach provides negligible decrease in performance in case of 1-bit quantization and the same performance in case of 2-bits quantization, compared to the full-precision CNNs. In general, the proposed IM/DD FSO receivers show better bit-error rate (BER) performance (without the need for channel state information (CSI)) compared to the maximum likelihood (ML) receivers that utilize imperfect CSI when the DL model is compressed whether with 1-bit or 2-bit quantization.

Title: An Exploration of ECAPA-TDNN and x-vector Speaker Representations in Zero-shot Multi-speaker TTS
Authors: Marie Kunešová, Zdeněk Hanzlíček, Jindřich Matoušek
Abstract: Zero-shot multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems rely on speaker embeddings to synthesize speech in the voice of an unseen speaker, using only a short reference utterance. While many speaker embeddings have been developed for speaker recognition, their relative effectiveness in zero-shot TTS remains underexplored. In this work, we employ a YourTTS-based TTS system to compare three different speaker encoders - YourTTS's original H/ASP encoder, x-vector embeddings, and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings - within an otherwise fixed zero-shot TTS framework. All models were trained on the same dataset of Czech read speech and evaluated on 24 out-of-domain target speakers using both subjective and objective methods. The subjective evaluation was conducted via a listening test focused on speaker similarity, while the objective evaluation measured cosine distances between speaker embeddings extracted from synthesized and real utterances. Across both evaluations, the original H/ASP encoder consistently outperformed the alternatives, with ECAPA-TDNN showing better results than x-vectors. These findings suggest that, despite the popularity of ECAPA-TDNN in speaker recognition, it does not necessarily offer improvements for speaker similarity in zero-shot TTS in this configuration. Our study highlights the importance of empirical evaluation when reusing speaker recognition embeddings in TTS and provides a framework for additional future comparisons.

Title: MS-IQA: A Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Network for PET/CT Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Siqiao Li, Chen Hui, Wei Zhang, Rui Liang, Chenyue Song, Feng Jiang, Haiqi Zhu, Zhixuan Li, Hong Huang, Xiang Li
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise, compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However, existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer, enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset, we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at this https URL.

Title: Volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging and architectural validation in human finger flexors
Authors: Yang Li
Abstract: Segmenting muscle compartments and measuring their architecture can facilitate movement function assessment, accurate musculoskeletal modeling, and synergy-based electromyogram simulation. Here, we presented a novel method for volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging, focusing on the independent compartments for finger control of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Besides, we measured the architectural properties of FDS compartments and validated the segmentation. Specifically, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 10 healthy subjects were used for segmentation and measurement, while electromyography was utilized for validation. A two-step piecewise segmentation was proposed, first annotating compartment regions in the cross-sectional ultrasound image based on compartment movement, and then performing minimum energy matching to register the ultrasound data to the three-dimensional MRI coordinate system. Additionally, the architectural properties were measured in the compartment masks from the segmentation using MRI tractography. Anatomical correctness was verified by comparing known anatomy with reconstructed fiber tracts and measured properties, while segmentation accuracy was quantified as the percentage of finger electromyogram centers falling within their corresponding compartments. Results demonstrated agreement for the fiber orientation between the tractography and cadaveric photographs. Significant differences in architectural properties (P < 0.001) were observed between compartments. The properties of FDS and its compartments were within the physiological ranges (P < 0.01). 95% (38/40) of the electromyogram centers were located within respective compartments, with 2 errors occurring in the index and little fingers. The validated segmentation method and derived architectural properties may advance biomedical applications.

Title: Sensing-Aware Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for OFDM-MBS Systems
Authors: Xinghe Li, Kainan Cheng, Huiyong Li, Huiyong Li, Ziyang Cheng
Abstract: In this letter, we study the problem of cooperative sensing design for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple base stations (MBS) system. We consider a practical scenario where the base stations (BSs) exploit certain subcarriers to realize a sensing function. Since the high sidelobe level (SLL) of OFDM waveforms degrades radar detection for weak targets, and the cross-correlation generated by other BSs further exacerbates detection performance, we devise a joint design scheme for OFDM sequence and receive filter by minimizing the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) while satisfying mainlobe level, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and spectrum allocation constraints. To address this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superiority of SSL reduction in the MBS system over the matched filtering method.

Title: Time and covariance smoothing for restoration of bivariate signals
Authors: Yusuf Yigit Pilavci (CRIStAL), Pierre Palud (LERMA), Julien Flamant (CRAN), Pierre-Antoine Thouvenin (CRIStAL), Jérémie Boulanger (CRIStAL), Pierre Chainais (CRIStAL)
Abstract: In many applications and physical phenomena, bivariate signals are polarized, i.e. they trace an elliptical trajectory over time when viewed in the 2D planes of their two components. The smooth evolution of this elliptical trajectory, called polarization ellipse, is highly informative to solve ill-posed inverse problems involving bivariate signals where the signal is collected through indirect, noisy or incomplete measurements. This work proposes a novel formulation and an efficient algorithm for reconstructing bivariate signals with polarization regularization. The proposed formulation leverages the compact representation of polarization through the instantaneous covariance matrices. To address the resulting quartic optimization problem, we propose a well-suited parameter splitting strategy which leads to an efficient iterative algorithm (alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)) with convex subproblems at each iteration. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated on numerical synthetic data experiments.

Title: A Data-Driven Approach for Topology Correction in Low Voltage Networks with DERs
Authors: Dong Liu, Sander Timmerman, Yu Xiang, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven topology identification and correction approach for low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) combined with a time-based smart meter data selection strategy, aiming to correct outdated recordings and identify the missed recordings. The proposed approach solely relies on voltage magnitude measurements, releasing privacy concerns and measurement burdens. It enables the distribution system operators to identify switch states through supervised learning algorithms, as well as determine user-feeder connections and phase labels of customers by a modified Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. To address the similarity among smart meter (SM) data caused by distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems, a time-based SM data selection strategy is combined with the proposed correlation analysis. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach are validated using modified real-world LVDNs and multiple incomplete SM datasets collected from customers in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate that the time-based SM data selection strategy effectively mitigates their impact on phase identification, and the corrected topology not only improves network observability but also supports network operators in load balancing and PV consumption.

Title: Cooperative Sensing and Communication Beamforming Design for Low-Altitude Economy
Authors: Fangzhi Li, Zhichu Ren, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Jing Jin, Qixing Wang, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: To empower the low-altitude economy with high-accuracy sensing and high-rate communication, this paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for aerial-ground networks. In the proposed system, the ground base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are equipped for either joint communication and sensing or sensing-only operations. The BSs employ coordinated beamforming to simultaneously transmit communication and sensing signals, while the UAVs execute their missions. To maximize the weighted sum rate under the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, receive filtering, and UAV trajectory. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using an alternating optimization framework incorporating semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design achieves higher communication throughput while ensuring required sensing robustness. Additionally, the sensing SINR threshold and the UAV altitude have a significant impact on the trajectory design, highlighting the necessity of adaptive deployment strategies in practical applications.

Title: Superimposed DMRS for Spectrally Efficient 6G Uplink Multi-User OFDM: Classical vs AI/ML Receivers
Authors: Sajad Rezaie, Mikko Honkala, Dani Korpi, Dick Carrillo Melgarejo, Tomasz Izydorczyk, Dimitri Gold, Oana-Elena Barbu
Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) systems utilize orthogonal demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to enable channel estimation at the receiver. These orthogonal DMRS-also referred to as pilots-are effective in avoiding pilot contamination and interference from both the user's own data and that of others. However, this approach incurs a significant overhead, as a substantial portion of the time-frequency resources must be reserved for pilot transmission. Moreover, the overhead increases with the number of users and transmission layers. To address these limitations in the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G) systems and to support data transmission across the entire time-frequency grid, the superposition of data and DMRS symbols has been explored as an alternative DMRS transmission strategy. In this study, we propose an enhanced version of DeepRx, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based receiver, capable of estimating the channel from received superimposed (SI) DMRS symbols and reliably detecting the transmitted data. We also design a conventional receiver for comparison, which estimates the channel from SI DMRS using classical signal processing techniques. Extensive evaluations in both uplink single-user and multi-user scenarios demonstrate that DeepRx consistently outperforms the conventional receivers in terms of performance.

Title: Opportunistic Osteoporosis Diagnosis via Texture-Preserving Self-Supervision, Mixture of Experts and Multi-Task Integration
Authors: Jiaxing Huang, Heng Guo, Le Lu, Fan Yang, Minfeng Xu, Ge Yang, Wei Luo
Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations. While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data. Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

Title: Analog OFDM based on Real-Time Fourier Transformation
Authors: Xiaolu Yang, Oscar Céspedes Vicente, Christophe Caloz
Abstract: This paper proposes an analog orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture based on the real-time Fourier transform (RTFT). The core enabling component is a linear-chirp phaser with engineered group velocity dispersion (GVD), which realizes RTFT and performs frequency-to-time mapping in the analog domain. In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two linear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the OFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically equivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is further supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol transmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a prefix is applied. Benefiting from the use of passive microwave components, the analog OFDM system offers ultra-fast processing with reduced power consumption. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for fully analog or hybrid analog-digital OFDM system, offering a promising solution for next-generation high-speed, wideband, and energy-efficient wireless communication platforms.

Title: Lightweight Target-Speaker-Based Overlap Transcription for Practical Streaming ASR
Authors: Aleš Pražák, Marie Kunešová, Josef Psutka
Abstract: Overlapping speech remains a major challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world applications, particularly in broadcast media with dynamic, multi-speaker interactions. We propose a light-weight, target-speaker-based extension to an existing streaming ASR system to enable practical transcription of overlapping speech with minimal computational overhead. Our approach combines a speaker-independent (SI) model for standard operation with a speaker-conditioned (SC) model selectively applied in overlapping scenarios. Overlap detection is achieved using a compact binary classifier trained on frozen SI model output, offering accurate segmentation at negligible cost. The SC model employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incorporate speaker embeddings and is trained on synthetically mixed data to transcribe only the target speaker. Our method supports dynamic speaker tracking and reuses existing modules with minimal modifications. Evaluated on a challenging set of Czech television debates with 16% overlap, the system reduced WER on overlapping segments from 68.0% (baseline) to 35.78% while increasing total computational load by only 44%. The proposed system offers an effective and scalable solution for overlap transcription in continuous ASR services.

Title: OLALa: Online Learned Adaptive Lattice Codes for Heterogeneous Federated Learning
Authors: Natalie Lang, Maya Simhi, Nir Shlezinger
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates. This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties. However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices (OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

Title: FundaQ-8: A Clinically-Inspired Scoring Framework for Automated Fundus Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Lee Qi Zun, Oscar Wong Jin Hao, Nor Anita Binti Che Omar, Zalifa Zakiah Binti Asnir, Mohamad Sabri bin Sinal Zainal, Goh Man Fye
Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage, anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on 1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability. Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

Title: Transformer Based Multi-Target Bernoulli Tracking for Maritime Radar
Authors: Caden Sweeney, Du Yong Kim, Branko Ristic, Brian Cheung
Abstract: Multi-target tracking in the maritime domain is a challenging problem due to the non-Gaussian and fluctuating characteristics of sea clutter. This article investigates the use of machine learning (ML) to the detection and tracking of low SIR targets in the maritime domain. The proposed method uses a transformer to extract point measurements from range-azimuth maps, before clustering and tracking using the Labelled mulit- Bernoulli (LMB) filter. A measurement driven birth density design based on the transformer attention maps is also developed. The error performance of the transformer based approach is presented and compared with a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection technique. The LMB filter is run in two scenarios, an ideal birth approach, and the measurement driven birth approach. Experiments indicate that the transformer based method has superior performance to the CFAR approach for all target scenarios discussed

Title: EAGLE: An Efficient Global Attention Lesion Segmentation Model for Hepatic Echinococcosis
Authors: Jiayan Chen, Kai Li, Yulu Zhao, Jianqiang Huang, Zhan Wang
Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields, and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space (HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling. Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from 260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Title: Recurrent neural network-based robust control systems with closed-loop regional incremental ISS and application to MPC design
Authors: Daniele Ravasio, Marcello Farina, Alessio La Bella, Andrea Ballarino
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS, we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Title: A Unified Framework for UAV-Based Free-Space Quantum Links: Beam Shaping and Adaptive Field-of-View Control
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Saif Al-Kuwari, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive analytical framework for modeling and performance evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-to-ground quantum communication links, incorporating key physical impairments such as beam divergence, pointing errors at both transmitter and receiver, atmospheric attenuation, turbulence-induced fading, narrow field-of-view (FoV) filtering, and background photon noise. To overcome the limitations of conventional wide-beam assumptions, we introduce a grid-based approximation for photon capture probability that remains accurate under tightly focused beams. Analytical expressions are derived for the quantum key generation rate and quantum bit error rate (QBER), enabling fast and reliable system-level evaluation. Our results reveal that secure quantum key distribution (QKD) over UAV-based free-space optical (FSO) links requires beam waists below 10 cm and sub-milliradian tracking precision to achieve Mbps-level key rates and QBER below $10^{-3}$. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of receiver FoV in balancing background noise rejection and misalignment tolerance, and propose adaptive FoV tuning strategies under varying illumination and alignment conditions. The proposed framework provides a tractable and accurate tool for the design, optimization, and deployment of next-generation airborne quantum communication systems.

Title: The role of audio-visual integration in the time course of phonetic encoding in self-supervised speech models
Authors: Yi Wang, Oli Danyi Liu, Peter Bell
Abstract: Human speech perception is multimodal. In natural speech, lip movements can precede corresponding voicing by a non-negligible gap of 100-300 ms, especially for specific consonants, affecting the time course of neural phonetic encoding in human listeners. However, it remains unexplored whether self-supervised learning models, which have been used to simulate audio-visual integration in humans, can capture this asynchronicity between audio and visual cues. We compared AV-HuBERT, an audio-visual model, with audio-only HuBERT, by using linear classifiers to track their phonetic decodability over time. We found that phoneme information becomes available in AV-HuBERT embeddings only about 20 ms before HuBERT, likely due to AV-HuBERT's lower temporal resolution and feature concatenation process. It suggests AV-HuBERT does not adequately capture the temporal dynamics of multimodal speech perception, limiting its suitability for modeling the multimodal speech perception process.

Title: Fusing Radiomic Features with Deep Representations for Gestational Age Estimation in Fetal Ultrasound Images
Authors: Fangyijie Wang, Yuan Liang, Sourav Bhattacharjee, Abey Campbell, Kathleen M. Curran, Guénolé Silvestre
Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care. However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on \href{this https URL}{GitHub}.

Title: Active RIS Enabled NLoS LEO Satellite Communications: A Three-timescale Optimization Framework
Authors: Ziwei Liu, Junyan He, Shanshan Zhao, Meng Hua, Bin Lyu, Xinjie Zhao, Gengxin Zhang
Abstract: In this letter, we study an active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) assisted Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, where the active RIS is deployed to create visual line-of-sight links for reliable communication. To address the challenges of high energy consumption caused by frequent beamforming updates in active RIS, we propose a three-timescale optimization framework that jointly designs the transmit beamforming, RIS beamforming, and RIS direction vectors based on their characteristics. The goal is to maximize the system achievable rate while reducing energy consumption by controlling the RIS beamforming switching frequency. Then, a two-layer solution framework is developed, incorporating fractional programming (FP), alternating optimization (AO), successive approximation (SCA), and penalty-based methods, to obtain the optimized solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve system performance and reduce the energy consumption of the active RIS.

Title: Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing for RGB Image Using Weighted Nucleus Sparsity and Total Variation Regularization
Authors: Nanxin Gong, Saori Takeyama, Masahiro Yamaguchi, Takumi Urata, Fumikazu Kimura, Keiko Ishii
Abstract: The Papanicolaou stain, consisting of eosin Y, hematoxylin, light Green SF yellowish, orange G, and Bismarck brown Y, provides extensive color information essential for cervical cancer screening in cytopathology. However, the visual observation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. In digital image analysis, the RGB intensities are affected by staining and imaging variations, hindering direct quantification of color in Papanicolaou-stained samples. Stain unmixing is a promising alternative that quantifies the amounts of dyes. In previous work, multispectral imaging was utilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain for quantitative diagnosis. Still, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the number of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key assumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of hematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain abundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity, weighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method achieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against the results of multispectral imaging. We also adopted the proposed method for discriminating lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a precancerous lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The resulting quantification distinctly characterized differences between LEGH and normal endocervical cells with stain abundance, and a classifier based on the quantification results achieved 98.0% accuracy. This demonstrates the significant potential of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.

Title: Learning-based safety lifting monitoring system for cranes on construction sites
Authors: Hao Chen, Yu Hin Ng, Ching-Wei Chang, Haobo Liang, Yanke Wang
Abstract: Lifting on construction sites, as a frequent operation, works still with safety risks, especially for modular integrated construction (MiC) lifting due to its large weight and size, probably leading to accidents, causing damage to the modules, or more critically, posing safety hazards to on-site workers. Aiming to reduce the safety risks in lifting scenarios, we design an automated safe lifting monitoring algorithm pipeline based on learning-based methods, and deploy it on construction sites. This work is potentially to increase the safety and efficiency of MiC lifting process via automation technologies. A dataset is created consisting of 1007 image-point cloud pairs (37 MiC liftings). Advanced object detection models are trained for automated two-dimensional (2D) detection of MiCs and humans. Fusing the 2D detection results with the point cloud information allows accurate determination of the three-dimensional (3D) positions of MiCs and humans. The system is designed to automatically trigger alarms that notify individuals in the MiC lifting danger zone, while providing the crane operator with real-time lifting information and early warnings. The monitoring process minimizes the human intervention and no or less signal men are required on real sites assisted by our system. A quantitative analysis is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithmic pipeline. The pipeline shows promising results in MiC and human perception with the mean distance error of 1.5640 m and 0.7824 m respectively. Furthermore, the developed system successfully executes safety risk monitoring and alarm functionalities during the MiC lifting process with limited manual work on real construction sites.

Title: Analyzing the Impact of Strategic Bidding on the Reserve Capacity via a Bi-Level Model
Authors: Yun Xu, Yunxiao Bai, Yunyong Zhang, Peng Wang, Xuelin Wang, Jiqun Guo, Kaijun Xie, Rusheng Zhao
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources necessitates adequate reserve capacity to maintain power balance. However, in market clearing, power companies with flexible resources may submit strategic bids to maximize profits, potentially compromising system reserves. This paper examines the effects of such strategic behavior by modeling the market as a bi-level problem. The upper level represents a strategic company aiming to maximize profit, while the lower level simulates the system operator clearing the market based on submitted offers. To enable duality-based solution methods, we approximate unit commitments with a continuous reserve capacity calculation. Case studies indicate that, in an imperfectly competitive market, more units are incentivized to operate,enhancing system reserves. However, some units go online mainly for profit, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. These findings highlight the importance of market design in managing the trade-off between reserve adequacy and economic efficiency in the presence of strategic bidding behavior.

Title: Revisiting CHAMPAGNE: Sparse Bayesian Learning as Reweighted Sparse Coding
Authors: Dylan Sechet, Matthieu Kowalski, Samy Mokhtari, Bruno Torrésani
Abstract: This paper revisits the CHAMPAGNE algorithm within the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) framework and establishes its connection to reweighted sparse coding. We demonstrate that the SBL objective can be reformulated as a reweighted $\ell_{21}$-minimization problem, providing a more straightforward interpretation of the sparsity mechanism and enabling the design of an efficient iterative algorithm. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions, particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.

Title: Differential Transformer-driven 6G Physical Layer for Collaborative Perception Enhancement
Authors: Soheyb Ribouh, Osama Saleem, Mohamed Ababsa
Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless networks promises to revolutionize vehicular communications by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity data exchange. In this context, collaborative perception techniques, where multiple vehicles or infrastructure nodes cooperate to jointly receive and decode transmitted signals, aim to enhance reliability and spectral efficiency for Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) applications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end wireless neural receiver based on a Differential Transformer architecture, tailored for 6G V2X communication with a specific focus on enabling collaborative perception among connected autonomous vehicles. Our model integrates key components of the 6G physical layer, designed to boost performance in dynamic and challenging autonomous driving environments. We validate the proposed system across a range of scenarios, including 3GPP-defined Urban Macro (UMa) channel. To assess the model's real-world applicability, we evaluate its robustness within a V2X framework. In a collaborative perception scenario, our system processes heterogeneous LiDAR and camera data from four connected vehicles in dynamic cooperative vehicular networks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average precision of 0.84, highlighting the potential of our proposed approach to enable robust, intelligent, and adaptive wireless cooperation for next-generation connected autonomous vehicles.

Title: Weighted Mean Frequencies: a handcraft Fourier feature for 4D Flow MRI segmentation
Authors: Simon Perrin, Sébastien Levilly, Huajun Sun, Harold Mouchère, Jean-Michel Serfaty
Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Title: Task Allocation of UAVs for Monitoring Missions via Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation and Experimental Validation
Authors: Hamza Chakraa, François Guérin, Edouard Leclercq, Dimitri Lefebvre
Abstract: This study addresses the optimisation of task allocation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within industrial monitoring missions. The proposed methodology integrates a Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a 2-Opt local search technique to obtain a high-quality solution. Our approach was experimentally validated in an industrial zone to demonstrate its efficacy in real-world scenarios. Also, a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator for the UAVs team is introduced. Moreover, insights about the correlation between the theoretical cost function and the actual battery consumption and time of flight are deeply analysed. Results show that the considered costs for the optimisation part of the problem closely correlate with real-world data, confirming the practicality of the proposed approach.

Title: Identifiability and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for System Identification of Networks of Dynamical Systems
Authors: Anders Hansson, João Victor Galvão da Mata, Martin S. Andersen
Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gröbner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.

Title: MC for Agriculture: A Framework for Nature-inspired Sustainable Pest Control
Authors: Fardad Vakilipoor, Nora Hirschmann, Julian Schladt, Stefan Schwab, Annette Reineke, Robert Schober, Kathrin Castiglione, Maximilian Schaefer
Abstract: In agriculture, molecular communication (MC) is envisioned as a framework to address critical challenges such as smart pest control. While conventional approaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high risks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to innovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this paper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how the MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular, we consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), specifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres deployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the microspheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and antagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant protection products. Based on experimental data, we investigate the MeSA release kinetics and obtain an analytical model. To describe the propagation of MeSA in farming environments, we employ a three dimensional (3D) advection-diffusion model, incorporating realistic wind fields which are predominantly affecting particle propagation, and solve it by a finite difference method (FDM). The proposed model is used to investigate the MeSA distribution for different TX arrangements, representing different practical microsphere deployment strategies. Moreover, we introduce the coverage effectiveness index (CEI) as a novel metric to quantify the environmental coverage of MeSA. This analysis offers valuable guidance for the practical development of microspheres and their deployment aimed at enhancing coverage and, consequently, the attraction of antagonistic insects.

Title: Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment for Generative Semantic Communications in AIGC Provisioning Tasks
Authors: Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%. Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Title: A Hybrid Intrusion Detection System with a New Approach to Protect the Cybersecurity of Cloud Computing
Authors: Maryam Mahdi Al-Husseini
Abstract: Cybersecurity is one of the foremost challenges facing the world of cloud computing. Recently, the widespread adoption of smart devices in cloud computing environments that provide Internet-based services has become prevalent. Therefore, it is essential to consider the security threats in these environments. The use of intrusion detection systems can mitigate the vulnerabilities of these systems. Furthermore, hybrid intrusion detection systems can provide better protection compared to conventional intrusion detection systems. These systems manage issues related to complexity, dimensionality, and performance. This research aims to propose a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS) that identifies and mitigates initial threats. The main innovation of this research is the introduction of a new method for hybrid intrusion detection systems (HyIDS). For this purpose, an Energy-Valley Optimizer (EVO) is used to select an optimal feature set, which is then classified using supervised machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated using the CIC_DDoS2019, CSE_CIC_DDoS2018, and NSL-KDD datasets. For evaluation and testing, the proposed system has been run for a total of 32 times. The results of the proposed approach are compared with the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). With the CIC_DDoS2019 dataset, the D_TreeEVO model achieves an accuracy of 99.13% and a detection rate of 98.941%. Furthermore, this result reaches 99.78% for the CSE_CIC_DDoS2018 dataset. In comparison to NSL-KDD, it has an accuracy of 99.50% and a detection rate (DT) of 99.48%. For feature selection, EVO outperforms GWO. The results of this research indicate that EVO yields better results as an optimizer for HyIDS performance.

Title: Notes on Degeneracy and Robustness
Authors: Indrakshi Dey, Nicola Marchetti
Abstract: Degeneracy is the ability of structurally different elements to perform the same function or yield the same output under certain constraints. In contrast to redundancy, which implies identical backups, degeneracy allows diverse components to step in and perform the same or similar role. Mathematically, it is about mapping multiple distinct elements into the same function. In a degenerate system, failure in one part can be compensated by others not structurally linked. System functions are distributed within the system itself or the entire network. This renders faster and more adaptive recovery. In this work, we define and formulate several novel metrics for resource fungibility to address robustness in networks (static/mobile/dynamic).

Abstract: The undergraduate-led Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) at the University of Chicago seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of circular polarization shift keyed satellite-to-ground laser communication. PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus. The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team. The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.

Title: First experimental demonstration of plasma shape control in a tokamak through Model Predictive Control
Authors: Adriano Mele, Maria A. Topalova, Cristian Galperti, Stefano Coda, TCV team, Eurofusion Tokamak Exploitation Team
Abstract: In this work, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is proposed to control the plasma shape in the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV). The proposed controller relies on models obtained by coupling linearized plasma response models, derived from the \texttt{fge} code of the Matlab EQuilibrium toolbox (MEQ) suite, with a state-space description of the core TCV magnetic control system. It optimizes the reference signals fed to this inner control loop in order to achieve the desired plasma shape while also enforcing constraints on the plant outputs. To this end, a suitable Quadratic Programming (QP) problem is formulated and solved in real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated through a combination of simulations and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a plasma shape control solution based on MPC has been experimentally tested on a real tokamak.

Title: Autonomous Cyber Resilience via a Co-Evolutionary Arms Race within a Fortified Digital Twin Sandbox
Authors: Malikussaid, Sutiyo
Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous, closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy, physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks. By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future of critical infrastructure.

Title: Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria for Deep Neural Network Acceleration
Authors: Deepak Ghimire, Kilho Lee, Seong-heum Kim
Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices. This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy.

Title: Efficient Channel Estimation for Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Wireless Communication
Authors: Xue Xiong, Beixiong Zheng, Wen Wu, Xiaodan Shao, Liang Dai, Ming-Min Zhao, Jie Tang
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.

Title: Causal discovery in deterministic discrete LTI-DAE systems
Authors: Bala Rajesh Konkathi, Arun K. Tangirala
Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations. However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables (PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations ($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix. Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Progressive Alignment Degradation Learning for Pansharpening
Authors: Enzhe Zhao, Zhichang Guo, Yao Li, Fanghui Song, Boying Wu
Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However, well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module (PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation for Hybrid Event-RGB Transmission
Authors: Pujing Yang, Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Lei Yu, Guanding Yu
Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs. This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information. Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Title: CBF-AFA: Chunk-Based Multi-SSL Fusion for Automatic Fluency Assessment
Authors: Papa Séga Wade, Mihai Andries, Ioannis Kanellos, Thierry Moudenc
Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations, n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing this http URL-based segmentation baselines. These findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation, though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular prosody.

Title: Efficient Feedback Design for Unsourced Random Access with Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Mohammad Javad Ahmadi, Mohammad Kazemi, Rafael F. Schaefer
Abstract: We consider an unsourced random access (URA) system enhanced with a feedback mechanism that serves both communication and sensing tasks. While traditional URA systems do not incorporate feedback, we propose a novel feedback signal design that announces the decoding status of users and simultaneously enables target sensing. To design this dual-purpose feedback, we introduce a modified projected gradient descent algorithm that minimizes a weighted combination of communication and sensing errors. Simulation results show that the proposed feedback design outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback design in the URA literature. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between communication and sensing capabilities, offering valuable insight into balancing these two tasks.

Title: Breaking Spatial Boundaries: Spectral-Domain Registration Guided Hyperspectral and Multispectral Blind Fusion
Authors: Kunjing Yang, Libin Zheng, Minru Bai, Ting Lu, Leyuan Fang
Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this, the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion. We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

Title: Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms for Unmanned Aerial and Ground Vehicles
Authors: Jingwen Wei
Abstract: The growing use of mobile robots in sectors such as automotive, agriculture, and rescue operations reflects progress in robotics and autonomy. In unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), most research emphasizes visual SLAM, sensor fusion, and path planning. However, applying UAVs to search and rescue missions in disaster zones remains underexplored, especially for autonomous navigation. This report develops methods for real-time and secure UAV maneuvering in complex 3D environments, crucial during forest fires. Building upon past research, it focuses on designing navigation algorithms for unfamiliar and hazardous environments, aiming to improve rescue efficiency and safety through UAV-based early warning and rapid response. The work unfolds in phases. First, a 2D fusion navigation strategy is explored, initially for mobile robots, enabling safe movement in dynamic settings. This sets the stage for advanced features such as adaptive obstacle handling and decision-making enhancements. Next, a novel 3D reactive navigation strategy is introduced for collision-free movement in forest fire simulations, addressing the unique challenges of UAV operations in such scenarios. Finally, the report proposes a unified control approach that integrates UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for coordinated rescue missions in forest environments. Each phase presents challenges, proposes control models, and validates them with mathematical and simulation-based evidence. The study offers practical value and academic insights for improving the role of UAVs in natural disaster rescue operations.

Title: A Visualization Framework for Exploring Multi-Agent-Based Simulations Case Study of an Electric Vehicle Home Charging Ecosystem
Authors: Kristoffer Christensen, Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen, Zheng Grace Ma
Abstract: Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) of electric vehicle (EV) home charging ecosystems generate large, complex, and stochastic time-series datasets that capture interactions between households, grid infrastructure, and energy markets. These interactions can lead to unexpected system-level events, such as transformer overloads or consumer dissatisfaction, that are difficult to detect and explain through static post-processing. This paper presents a modular, Python-based dashboard framework, built using Dash by Plotly, that enables efficient, multi-level exploration and root-cause analysis of emergent behavior in MABS outputs. The system features three coordinated views (System Overview, System Analysis, and Consumer Analysis), each offering high-resolution visualizations such as time-series plots, spatial heatmaps, and agent-specific drill-down tools. A case study simulating full EV adoption with smart charging in a Danish residential network demonstrates how the dashboard supports rapid identification and contextual explanation of anomalies, including clustered transformer overloads and time-dependent charging failures. The framework facilitates actionable insight generation for researchers and distribution system operators, and its architecture is adaptable to other distributed energy resources and complex energy systems.

Title: A Decomposition Method for Finite-Time Stabilization of Bilinear Systems with Applications to Parabolic and Hyperbolic Equations
Authors: Kamal Fenza, Moussa Labbadi, Mohamed Ouzahra
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of finite-time stabilization for a class of bilinear system. We propose a decomposition-based approach in which the nominal system is split into two subsystems, one of which is inherently finite-time stable without control. This allows the stabilization analysis to focus solely on the remaining subsystem. To ensure the well-posedness of the closed-loop system, we establish sufficient conditions on the system and control operators. The stabilization results are then derived using a suitable Lyapunov function and an observation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through examples involving both parabolic and hyperbolic infinite-dimensional systems.

Title: Industrial Energy Disaggregation with Digital Twin-generated Dataset and Efficient Data Augmentation
Authors: Christian Internò, Andrea Castellani, Sebastian Schmitt, Fabio Stella, Barbara Hammer
Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Increases Wind Farm Power Production by Enabling Closed-Loop Collaborative Control
Authors: Andrew Mole, Max Weissenbacher, Georgios Rigas, Sylvain Laizet
Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production. Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static, low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable energy deployment to net-zero targets.

Title: Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering of LLMs, for the Creation of Multi-Agent AI for Addressing Sustainable Protein Production Challenges
Authors: Alexander D. Kalian, Jaewook Lee, Stefan P. Johannesson, Lennart Otte, Christer Hogstrand, Miao Guo
Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Title: Nonparametric Steady-State Learning for Nonlinear Output Feedback Regulation
Authors: Shimin Wang, Martin Guay, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the proposed nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization formulation for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics. This approach removes the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semi-definite derivatives and avoids the common assumption of linear parameterization of the nonlinear system. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be tackled using a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous to guarantee the convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks: a Plug and Play Integration into Power System Dynamic Simulations
Authors: Ignasi Ventura Nadal, Jochen Stiasny, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: Time-domain simulations are crucial for ensuring power system stability and avoiding critical scenarios that could lead to blackouts. The next-generation power systems require a significant increase in the computational cost and complexity of these simulations due to additional degrees of uncertainty, non-linearity and states. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been shown to accelerate single-component simulations by several orders of magnitude. However, their application to current time-domain simulation solvers has been particularly challenging since the system's dynamics depend on multiple components. Using a new training formulation, this paper introduces the first natural step to integrate PINNs into multi-component time-domain simulations. We propose PINNs as an alternative to other classical numerical methods for individual components. Once trained, these neural networks approximate component dynamics more accurately for longer time steps. Formulated as an implicit and consistent method with the transient simulation workflow, PINNs speed up simulation time by significantly increasing the time steps used. For explanation clarity, we demonstrate the training, integration, and simulation framework for several combinations of PINNs and numerical solution methods using the IEEE 9-bus system, although the method applies equally well to any power system size.

Title: Cross-attention Inspired Selective State Space Models for Target Sound Extraction
Authors: Donghang Wu, Yiwen Wang, Xihong Wu, Tianshu Qu
Abstract: The Transformer model, particularly its cross-attention module, is widely used for feature fusion in target sound extraction which extracts the signal of interest based on given clues. Despite its effectiveness, this approach suffers from low computational efficiency. Recent advancements in state space models, notably the latest work Mamba, have shown comparable performance to Transformer-based methods while significantly reducing computational complexity in various tasks. However, Mamba's applicability in target sound extraction is limited due to its inability to capture dependencies between different sequences as the cross-attention does. In this paper, we propose CrossMamba for target sound extraction, which leverages the hidden attention mechanism of Mamba to compute dependencies between the given clues and the audio mixture. The calculation of Mamba can be divided to the query, key and value. We utilize the clue to generate the query and the audio mixture to derive the key and value, adhering to the principle of the cross-attention mechanism in Transformers. Experimental results from two representative target sound extraction methods validate the efficacy of the proposed CrossMamba.

Title: Thermal Modelling of Battery Cells for Optimal Tab and Surface Cooling Control
Authors: Godwin K. Peprah, Yicun Huang, Torsten Wik, Faisal Altaf, Changfu Zou
Abstract: Optimal cooling that minimises thermal gradients and the average temperature is essential for enhanced battery safety and health. This work presents a new modelling approach for battery cells of different shapes by integrating Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin method and model component decomposition. As a result, a library of reduced-order computationally efficient battery thermal models is obtained, characterised by different numbers of states. These models are validated against a high-fidelity finite element model and are compared with a thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) model under real-world vehicle driving and battery cooling scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed model with four states can faithfully capture the two-dimensional thermal dynamics, while the model with only one state significantly outperforms the widely-used two-state TEC model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, reducing computation time by 28.7%. Furthermore, our developed models allow for independent control of tab and surface cooling channels, enabling effective thermal performance optimisation. Additionally, the proposed model's versatility and effectiveness are demonstrated through various applications, including the evaluation of different cooling scenarios, closed-loop temperature control, and cell design optimisation.

Title: Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO OFDM with Phase Noise-Aware Channel Estimation: Separate and Shared Local Oscillators
Authors: Yibo Wu, Luca Sanguinetti, Musa Furkan Keskin, Ulf Gustavsson, Alexandre Graell i Amat, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks enhance coverage and spectral efficiency (SE) by distributing antennas across access points (APs) with phase coherence between APs. However, the use of cost-efficient local oscillators (LOs) introduces phase noise (PN) that compromises phase coherence, even with centralized processing. Sharing an LO across APs can reduce costs in specific configurations but cause correlated PN between APs, leading to correlated interference that affects centralized combining. This can be improved by exploiting the PN correlation in channel estimation. This paper presents an uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal model for PN-impaired cell-free mMIMO, addressing gaps in single-carrier signal models. We evaluate mismatches from applying single-carrier methods to OFDM systems, showing how they underestimate the impact of PN and produce over-optimistic achievable SE predictions. Based on our OFDM signal model, we propose two PN-aware channel and common phase error estimators: a distributed estimator for uncorrelated PN with separate LOs and a centralized estimator with shared LOs. We introduce a deep learning-based channel estimator to enhance the performance and reduce the number of iterations of the centralized estimator. The simulation results show that the distributed estimator outperforms mismatched estimators with separate LOs, whereas the centralized estimator enhances distributed estimators with shared LOs.

Title: Operator Learning for Robust Stabilization of Linear Markov-Jumping Hyperbolic PDEs
Authors: Yihuai Zhang, Jean Auriol, Huan Yu
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of robust stabilization for linear hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty. We consider a 2 x 2 heterogeneous hyperbolic PDE and propose a control law using operator learning and the backstepping method. Specifically, the backstepping kernels used to construct the control law are approximated with neural operators (NO) in order to improve computational efficiency. The key challenge lies in deriving the stability conditions with respect to the Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty and NO approximation errors. The mean-square exponential stability of the stochastic system is achieved through Lyapunov analysis, indicating that the system can be stabilized if the random parameters are sufficiently close to the nominal parameters on average, and NO approximation errors are small enough. The theoretical results are applied to freeway traffic control under stochastic upstream demands and then validated through numerical simulations.

Title: Aggregative games with bilevel structures: Distributed algorithms and convergence analysis
Authors: Kaihong Lu, Huanshui Zhang, Long Wang
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributively seeking the equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of a virtual leader's objective function in the inner level, which depends on the actions of the players in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function of the virtual leader is formed by the sum of some local functions with two arguments, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument. When making decisions, each player in the outer level only has access to a local part of the virtual leader's objective function. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the leader are involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions while cooperatively minimizing the objective function of the virtual leader to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium point. Then, for the case where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the virtual leader are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of players' cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions to the Nash equilibrium point are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Title: SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications
Authors: Hao Mo, Yaping Sun, Shumin Yao, Hao Chen, Zhiyong Chen, Xiaodong Xu, Nan Ma, Meixia Tao, Shuguang Cui
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.

Title: BSM-iMagLS: ILD Informed Binaural Signal Matching for Reproduction with Head-Mounted Microphone Arrays
Authors: Or Berebi, Zamir Ben-Hur, David Lou Alon, Boaz Rafaely
Abstract: Headphone listening in applications such as augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) relies on high-quality spatial audio to ensure immersion, making accurate binaural reproduction a critical component. As capture devices, wearable arrays with only a few microphones with irregular arrangement face challenges in achieving a reproduction quality comparable to that of arrays with a large number of microphones. Binaural signal matching (BSM) has recently been presented as a signal-independent approach for generating high-quality binaural signal using only a few microphones, which is further improved using magnitude-least squares (MagLS) optimization at high frequencies. This paper extends BSM with MagLS by introducing interaural level difference (ILD) into the MagLS, integrated into BSM (BSM-iMagLS). Using a deep neural network (DNN)-based solver, BSM-iMagLS achieves joint optimization of magnitude, ILD, and magnitude derivatives, improving spatial fidelity. Performance is validated through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations with diverse HRTFs and head-mounted array geometries, and listening experiments, demonstrating a substantial reduction in ILD errors while maintaining comparable magnitude accuracy to state-of-the-art solutions. The results highlight the potential of BSM-iMagLS to enhance binaural reproduction for wearable and portable devices.

Title: Exponentially Stable Combined Adaptive Control under Finite Excitation Condition
Authors: Manish Patel, Arnab Maity
Abstract: The parameter convergence relies on a stringent persistent excitation (PE) condition in adaptive control. Several works have proposed a memory term in the last decade to translate the PE condition to a feasible finite excitation (FE) condition. This work proposes a combined model reference adaptive control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with an unknown control effectiveness vector. The closed-loop system is exponentially stable under the FE condition. The exponential rate of convergence is independent of the excitation level of the regressor vector and is lower-bounded in terms of the system parameters and user-designed gains. Numerical simulation is illustrated, validating the results obtained with the proposed adaptive control.

Title: Decentralized Parametric Stability Certificates for Grid-Forming Converter Control
Authors: Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler, Steven Low
Abstract: We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.

Title: TEANet: A Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network for Wearable Stress Monitoring
Authors: Md Santo Ali, Sapnil Sarker Bipro, Mohammod Abdul Motin, Sumaiya Kabir, Manish Sharma, M. E. H. Chowdhury
Abstract: Mental stress poses a significant public health concern due to its detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being, necessitating the development of continuous stress monitoring tools for wearable devices. Blood volume pulse (BVP) sensors, readily available in many smartwatches, offer a convenient and cost-effective solution for stress monitoring. This study proposes a deep learning approach, a Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network (TEANet), for stress detection using BVP signals. The proposed TEANet model was trained and validated utilizing a self-collected RUET SPML dataset, comprising 19 healthy subjects, and the publicly available wearable stress and affect detection (WESAD) dataset, comprising 15 healthy subjects. It achieves the highest accuracy of 92.51% and 96.94%, F1 scores of 95.03% and 95.95%, and kappa of 0.7915 and 0.9350 for RUET SPML, and WESAD datasets respectively. The proposed TEANet effectively detects mental stress through BVP signals with high accuracy, making it a promising tool for continuous stress monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed model effectively addresses class imbalances and demonstrates high accuracy, underscoring its potential for reliable real-time stress monitoring using wearable devices.

Title: Inference and Learning of Nonlinear LFR State-Space Models
Authors: Merijn Floren, Jean-Philippe Noël, Jan Swevers
Abstract: Estimating the parameters of nonlinear block-oriented state-space models from input-output data typically involves solving a highly non-convex optimization problem, which is prone to poor local minima and slow convergence. This paper presents a computationally efficient initialization method for nonlinear linear fractional representation (NL-LFR) models using periodic data. By first inferring the latent signals and subsequently estimating the model parameters, the approach generates initial estimates for use in a later nonlinear optimization step. The proposed method shows robustness against poor local minima, and achieves a twofold error reduction compared to the state-of-the-art on a challenging benchmark dataset.

Title: Age-of-information minimization under energy harvesting and non-stationary environment
Authors: Akanksha Jaiswal, Arpan Chattopadhyay
Abstract: This work focuses on minimizing the age of information for multiple energy harvesting sources that sample data and transmit it to a sink node. At each time, the central scheduler selects one of the sources to probe the quality of its channel to the sink node, and then the assessed channel quality is utilized to determine whether a source will sample and send the packet. For a single source case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time instant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process, and prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this threshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and time varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the popular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This algorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total variation of each of these quantities over a time horizon. Furthermore, in situations where these variation budgets are not accessible, we introduce the AEC-BORL algorithm, motivated by the well known BORL algorithm. For the multiple source case, we demonstrate that the AoI minimization problem can be formulated as a constrained MDP, which can be relaxed using a Lagrange multiplier and decoupled into sub problems across source nodes. We also derive Whittle index based source scheduling policy for probing and an optimal threshold policy for source sampling. We next leverage this Whittle index and threshold structure to develop the WIT-SW-UCRL2 algorithm for unknown time varying energy harvesting rates and channel statistics under their respective variation budgets. Moreover, we also proposed a Whittle index and threshold based bandit over reinforcement learning (WIT-BORL) algorithm for unknown variation budgets. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms.

Title: AI-Driven Smart Sportswear for Real-Time Fitness Monitoring Using Textile Strain Sensors
Authors: Chenyu Tang, Wentian Yi, Zibo Zhang, Edoardo Occhipinti, Luigi G. Occhipinti
Abstract: Wearable biosensors have revolutionized human performance monitoring by enabling real-time assessment of physiological and biomechanical parameters. However, existing solutions lack the ability to simultaneously capture breath-force coordination and muscle activation symmetry in a seamless and non-invasive manner, limiting their applicability in strength training and rehabilitation. This work presents a wearable smart sportswear system that integrates screen-printed graphene-based strain sensors with compact electronics for wireless data transfer and a deep learning framework for real-time classification of exercise execution quality. By leveraging 1D ResNet-18 for feature extraction, the system achieves 92.1% classification accuracy across six exercise conditions, distinguishing between breathing irregularities and asymmetric muscle exertion. Additionally, t-SNE analysis and Grad-CAM-based explainability visualization confirm that the network accurately captures biomechanically relevant features, ensuring robust interpretability. The proposed system establishes a foundation for next-generation AI-powered sportswear, with applications in fitness optimization, injury prevention, and adaptive rehabilitation training.

Title: Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation
Authors: Francesco Popolizio, Torsten Wik, Chih Feng Lee, Changfu Zou
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.

Title: A Deep Learning-Based Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections
Authors: Bo Zhou, Kaijie Xu, Yinghui Quan, Mengdao Xing
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections. In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

Title: Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems
Authors: Julian Barreiro-Gomez, Ye Wang
Abstract: We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.

Abstract: Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. As a consequence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS pulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR (only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and delay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on the discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that achieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus reducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS achieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB lower PAPR per basis element. We demonstrate uncoded bit error rate (BER) similar to pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, and improved BER performance over competing methods based on OFDM and OTFS in high mobility & delay spread environments.

Title: Followerstopper Revisited: Phase-space Lagrangian Controller for Traffic Decongestion
Authors: Rahul Bhadani
Abstract: This paper revisits Followerstopper, a phase-space-based control system that had demonstrated its ability to mitigate emergent traffic jams due to stop-and-go traffic during rush hour in the mixed-autonomy setting. Followerstopper was deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.

Title: From Coarse to Continuous: Progressive Refinement Implicit Neural Representation for Motion-Robust Anisotropic MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Zhenxuan Zhang, Lipei Zhang, Yanqi Cheng, Zi Wang, Fanwen Wang, Haosen Zhang, Yue Yang, Yinzhe Wu, Jiahao Huang, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero, Zhifan Gao, Guang Yang, Peter J. Lally
Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR) framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision. Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement), undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

Title: LVPNet: A Latent-variable-based Prediction-driven End-to-end Framework for Lossless Compression of Medical Images
Authors: Chenyue Song, Chen Hui, Qing Lin, Wei Zhang, Siqiao Li, Haiqi Zhu, Zhixuan Li, Shengping Zhang, Shaohui Liu, Feng Jiang, Xiang Li
Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining competitive inference speed.

Title: Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks
Authors: Arthur N. Montanari, Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.

Title: On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability
Authors: Arthur N. Montanari, Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.

Abstract: Molecular assays are standard of care for detecting genomic alterations in cancer prognosis and therapy selection but are costly, tissue-destructive and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.

Title: Prediction of Wireless Channel Statistics with Ray Tracing and Uncalibrated Digital Twin
Authors: Mahmoud Saad Abouamer, Robin J. Williams, Petar Popovski
Abstract: We introduce a framework for predicting wireless channel statistics based on digital twin (DT) and ray tracing. The DT is derived from satellite images and is uncalibrated, as it does not assume precise information on the electromagnetic properties of the materials in the environment. The uncalibrated DT is utilized to derive a geometric prior that informs a Gaussian process (GP) and thereby predict channel statistics using only a few measurements. The framework also quantifies uncertainty, offering statistical guarantees for rate selection in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework using measurement data.

Title: Learning Adaptive Lighting via Channel-Aware Guidance
Authors: Qirui Yang, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Bo Li, Huanjing Yue, Jingyu Yang
Abstract: Learning lighting adaptation is a crucial step in achieving good visual perception and supporting downstream vision tasks. Current research often addresses individual light-related challenges, such as high dynamic range imaging and exposure correction, in isolation. However, we identify shared fundamental properties across these tasks: i) different color channels have different light properties, and ii) the channel differences reflected in the spatial and frequency domains are different. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the channel-aware Learning Adaptive Lighting Network (LALNet), a multi-task framework designed to handle multiple light-related tasks efficiently. Specifically, LALNet incorporates color-separated features that highlight the unique light properties of each color channel, integrated with traditional color-mixed features by Light Guided Attention (LGA). The LGA utilizes color-separated features to guide color-mixed features focusing on channel differences and ensuring visual consistency across all channels. Additionally, LALNet employs dual domain channel modulation for generating color-separated features and a mixed channel modulation and light state space module for producing color-mixed features. Extensive experiments on four representative light-related tasks demonstrate that LALNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark tests and requires fewer computational resources.

Title: Representation Learning with Parameterised Quantum Circuits for Advancing Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Thejan Rajapakshe, Rajib Rana, Farina Riaz, Sara Khalifa, Björn W. Schuller
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) offers a promising avenue for advancing representation learning in complex signal domains. In this study, we investigate the use of parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) for speech emotion recognition (SER) a challenging task due to the subtle temporal variations and overlapping affective states in vocal signals. We propose a hybrid quantum classical architecture that integrates PQCs into a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to enrich emotional feature representations. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets IEMOCAP, RECOLA, and MSP-IMPROV demonstrate that our hybrid model achieves improved classification performance relative to a purely classical CNN baseline, with over 50% reduction in trainable parameters. This work provides early evidence of the potential for QML to enhance emotion recognition and lays the foundation for future quantum-enabled affective computing systems.

Title: Low-Complexity Detection of Permutational Index Modulation for Noncoherent Communications
Authors: Marc Vilà-Insa, Aniol Martí, Meritxell Lamarca, Jaume Riba
Abstract: This work presents a massive SIMO scheme for wireless communications with one-shot noncoherent detection. It is based on permutational index modulation over OFDM. Its core principle is to convey information on the ordering in which a fixed collection of values is mapped onto a set of OFDM subcarriers. A spherical code is obtained which provides improved robustness against channel impairments. A simple detector based on the sorting of quadratic metrics of data is proposed. By exploiting statistical channel state information and hardening, it reaches near-ML error performance with a low-complexity implementation.

Title: Power-Capping Metric Evaluation for Improving Energy Efficiency in HPC Applications
Authors: Maria Patrou, Thomas Wang, Wael Elwasif, Markus Eisenbach, Ross Miller, William Godoy, Oscar Hernandez
Abstract: With high-performance computing systems now running at exascale, optimizing power-scaling management and resource utilization has become more critical than ever. This paper explores runtime power-capping optimizations that leverage integrated CPU-GPU power management on architectures like the NVIDIA GH200 superchip. We evaluate energy-performance metrics that account for simultaneous CPU and GPU power-capping effects by using two complementary approaches: speedup-energy-delay and a Euclidean distance-based multi-objective optimization method. By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts. Our results highlight how GPU task-specific dynamic power-cap adjustments combined with integrated CPU-GPU power steering can improve the energy utilization of certain GPU tasks, thereby laying the groundwork for future adaptive optimization strategies.

Title: mSTEB: Massively Multilingual Evaluation of LLMs on Speech and Text Tasks
Authors: Luel Hagos Beyene, Vivek Verma, Min Ma, Jesujoba O. Alabi, Fabian David Schmidt, Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende, David Ifeoluwa Adelani
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However, their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages. For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Title: SLEEPING-DISCO 9M: A large-scale pre-training dataset for generative music modeling
Authors: Tawsif Ahmed, Andrej Radonjic, Gollam Rabby
Abstract: We present Sleeping-DISCO 9M, a large-scale pre-training dataset for music and song. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source high-quality dataset representing popular and well-known songs for generative music modeling tasks such as text-music, music-captioning, singing-voice synthesis, melody reconstruction and cross-model retrieval. Past contributions focused on isolated and constrained factors whose core perspective was to create synthetic or re-recorded music corpus (e.g. GTSinger, M4Singer) and arbitrarily large-scale audio datasets (e.g. DISCO-10M and LAIONDISCO-12M) had been another focus for the community. Unfortunately, adoption of these datasets has been below substantial in the generative music community as these datasets fail to reflect real-world music and its flavour. Our dataset changes this narrative and provides a dataset that is constructed using actual popular music and world-renowned artists.

Title: In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory
Authors: Matteo Zecchin, Tomer Raviv, Dileep Kalathil, Krishna Narayanan, Nir Shlezinger, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Title: TCDiff++: An End-to-end Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion Model for Harmonious Music-Driven Group Choreography
Authors: Yuqin Dai, Wanlu Zhu, Ronghui Li, Xiu Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Jun Li, Jian Yang
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.
