Title: Channel Selected Stratified Nested Cross Validation for Clinically Relevant EEG Based Parkinsons Disease Detection
Authors: Nicholas R. Rasmussen, Rodrigue Rizk, Longwei Wang, Arun Singh, KC Santosh
Abstract: The early detection of Parkinsons disease remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroscience, with electroencephalography offering a noninvasive and scalable pathway toward population level screening. While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage. Applied across three independent datasets with a heterogeneous number of channels, a convolutional neural network trained under this framework achieved 80.6% accuracy and demonstrated state of the art performance under held out population block testing, comparable to other methods in the literature. This performance underscores the necessity of nested cross validation as a safeguard against bias and as a principled means of selecting the most relevant information for patient level decisions, providing a reproducible foundation that can extend to other biomedical signal analysis domains.

Title: Discrete Mode Decomposition Meets Shapley Value: Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet
Authors: Mohammad Ali Vahedifar, Qi Zhang
Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and high reliability to ensure stability and transparency in touch-enabled teleoperation. However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions. Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems.

Title: Data-Based Analysis of Relative Degree and Zero Dynamics in Linear Systems
Authors: Janina Schaa, Thomas Berger
Abstract: Data-driven control offers a powerful alternative to traditional model-based methods, particularly when accurate system models are unavailable or prohibitively complex. While existing data-driven control methods primarily aim to construct controllers directly from measured data, our approach uses the available data to assess fundamental system-theoretic properties. This allows the informed selection of suitable control strategies without explicit model identification. We provide data-based conditions characterizing the (vector) relative degree and the stability of the zero dynamics, which are critical for ensuring proper performance of modern controllers. Our results cover both single- and multi-input/output settings of discrete-time linear systems. We further show how a continuous-time system can be reconstructed from three sampling discretizations obtained via Zero-order Hold at suitable sampling times, thus allowing the extension of the results to the combined data collected from these discretizations. All results can be applied directly to observed data sets using the proposed algorithms.

Title: Experimental Demonstration of a Decentralized Electromagnetic Formation Flying Control Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces
Authors: Sumit S. Kamat, Ajin Sunny, T. Michael Seigler, Jesse B. Hoagg
Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flying (EMFF) is challenging due to the complex coupling between the electromagnetic fields generated by each satellite in the formation. To address this challenge, this article uses alternating magnetic field forces (AMFF) to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled to achieve desired forces between each pair of satellites. The main contribution of this article is a 3-satellite experimental demonstration of decentralized closed-loop EMFF using AMFF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of AMFF with at least 3 satellites in open or closed loop. This is noteworthy because the coupling challenges of EMFF are only present with more than 2 satellites, and thus, a formation of at least 3 is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of AMFF. The experiments are conducted on a ground-based testbed consisting of 3 electromagnetically actuated satellites on linear air tracks. The closed-loop experimental results are compared with behavior from numerical simulations.

Title: SPARK: Sparse Parametric Antenna Representation using Kernels
Authors: William Bjorndahl, Mark O'Hair, Ben Zoghi, Joseph Camp
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition and feedback overhead grows with the number of antennas, users, and reported subbands. This growth becomes a bottleneck for many antenna and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) systems as arrays and user densities scale. Practical CSI feedback and beam management rely on codebooks, where beams are selected via indices rather than explicitly transmitting radiation patterns. Hardware-aware operation requires an explicit representation of the measured antenna/RIS response, yet high-fidelity measured patterns are high-dimensional and costly to handle. We present SPARK (Sparse Parametric Antenna Representation using Kernels), a training-free compression model that decomposes patterns into a smooth global base and sparse localized lobes. For 3D patterns, SPARK uses low-order spherical harmonics for global directivity and anisotropic Gaussian kernels for localized features. For RIS 1D azimuth cuts, it uses a Fourier-series base with 1D Gaussians. On patterns from the AERPAW testbed and a public RIS dataset, SPARK achieves up to 2.8$\times$ and 10.4$\times$ reductions in reconstruction MSE over baselines, respectively. Simulation shows that amortizing a compact pattern description and reporting sparse path descriptors can produce 12.65% mean uplink goodput gain under a fixed uplink budget. Overall, SPARK turns dense patterns into compact, parametric models for scalable, hardware-aware beam management.

Title: How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation
Authors: Joseph Nyangon, Brecht Seifi
Abstract: The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.

Title: SIaD-Tool: A Comprehensive Frequency-Domain Tool for Small-Signal Stability and Interaction Assessment in Modern Power Systems
Authors: Luis A. Garcia-Reyes, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Vinícius A. Lacerda, Marc Cheah-Mañe
Abstract: This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.

Title: Discrete Homogeneity and Quantizer Design for Nonlinear Homogeneous Control Systems
Authors: Yu Zhou, Andrey Polyakov, Gang Zheng, Masaaki Nagahara
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for analysis of generalized homogeneous control systems under state quantization. In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: LLM-DMD: Large Language Model-based Power System Dynamic Model Discovery
Authors: Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Ke Zuo, Wenqi Huang, Mingyang Sun
Abstract: Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.

Title: Deformation-Aware Observation Modeling for Radar-Based Human Sensing via 3D Scan-Depth Sequence Fusion
Authors: Guangqi Shi, Kimitaka Sumi, Takuya Sakamoto
Abstract: Non-contact radar-based human sensing is often interpreted using simplified motion assumptions. However, respiration induces non-rigid surface deformation of the human body that impacts electromagnetic wave scattering and can degrade the robustness of measurements. To address this, we propose a surface-deformation-aware observation model for radar-based human sensing that fuses static high-resolution three-dimensional scanner measurements with temporal depth camera data to represent time-varying human surface geometry. Non-rigid registration using the coherent point drift algorithm is employed to align a static template with dynamic depth frames. Frame-wise electromagnetic scattering is subsequently computed using the physical optics approximation, allowing the reconstruction of intermediate-frequency radar signals that emulate radar observations. Validation against experimental radar data demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited greater robustness than a depth-sequence-only model under low-signal-quality conditions involving complex surface dynamics and multiple reflective sites. For two participants, the proposed model achieved higher Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.943 and 0.887 between model-derived and experimentally measured displacement waveforms, compared with 0.868 and 0.796 for the depth-sequence-only model. Furthermore, in a favorable case characterized by a single relatively-stationary reflective site, the proposed method achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.789 between model-derived and experimentally measured in-phase-quadrature magnitude variations. These results suggest that our sensor-fusion-based deformation-aware observation modeling can realistically reproduce radar observations and provide physically grounded insights into the interpretation of radar measurement variations.

Title: Explicit Reward Mechanisms for Local Flexibility in Renewable Energy Communities
Authors: Thomas Stegen, Julien Allard, Noé Diffels, François Vallée, Mevludin Glavic, Zacharie De Grève, Bertrand Cornélusse
Abstract: Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.

Title: Modeling and Bifurcation Analysis of Longitudinal Dynamics of an Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle
Authors: Kavita Shekhawat, Nandan Kumar Sinha
Abstract: A nonlinear model of an Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle (ABHV) longitudinal dynamics characterized by coupling of aerodynamic and propulsive terms is presented in this paper. The model is verified using modal analysis carried out around a design operating condition with results available in the literature. Further, parametric dynamic behavior is computed for the model as steady states with local stability with respect to its control inputs, elevator and fuel-equivalence ratio in four different cases using a numerical continuation algorithm. Detailed analysis of the qualitative longitudinal dynamics of the model is carried out based on bifurcation theory methodology. Numerical simulation results are presented to verify bifurcation analysis results.

Title: A Novel Deep Learning-Based Coarse-to-Fine Frame Synchronization Method for OTFS Systems
Authors: Meiwen Men, Tao Zhou, Kaifeng Bao, Zhiyang Guo, Yongning Qi, Liu Liu, Bo Ai
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a robust candidate waveform for future wireless systems, particularly in high-mobility scenarios, as it effectively mitigates the impact of rapidly time-varying channels by mapping symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, accurate frame synchronization in OTFS systems remains a challenge due to the performance limitations of conventional algorithms. To address this, we propose a low-complexity synchronization method based on a coarse-to-fine deep residual network (ResNet) architecture. Unlike traditional approaches relying on high-overhead preamble structures, our method exploits the intrinsic periodic features of OTFS pilots in the delay-time (DT) domain to formulate synchronization as a hierarchical classification problem. Specifically, the proposed architecture employs a two-stage strategy to first narrow the search space and then pinpoint the precise symbol timing offset (STO), thereby significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high estimation accuracy. We construct a comprehensive simulation dataset incorporating diverse channel models and randomized STO to validate the method. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust signal start detection and superior accuracy compared to conventional benchmarks, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes and high-mobility scenarios.

Title: Cedalion Tutorial: A Python-based framework for comprehensive analysis of multimodal fNIRS & DOT from the lab to the everyday world
Authors: E. Middell, L. Carlton, S. Moradi, T. Codina, T. Fischer, J. Cutler, S. Kelley, J. Behrendt, T. Dissanayake, N. Harmening, M. A. Yücel, D. A. Boas, A. von Lühmann
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) are rapidly evolving toward wearable, multimodal, and data-driven, AI-supported neuroimaging in the everyday world. However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.

Title: Generalized Spectral Clustering of Low-Inertia Power Networks
Authors: Gerald Ogbonna, C. Lindsay Anderson
Abstract: Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.

Title: Curving Beam Reflections: Model and Experimental Validation
Authors: Caroline Jane Spindel, Edward Knightly
Abstract: Curving beams are a promising new method for bypassing obstacles in future millimeter-wave to sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks but lack a general predictive model for their reflections from arbitrary surfaces. We show that, unfortunately, attempting to "mirror" the incident beam trajectory across the normal of the reflector, as in ray optics, fails in general. Thus, we introduce the first geometric framework capable of modeling the reflections of arbitrary convex sub-THz curving beams from general reflectors with experimental verification. Rather than "mirroring" the trajectory, we decompose the beam into a family of tangents and demonstrate that this process is equivalent to the Legendre transform. This approach allows us to accurately account for reflectors of any shape, size, and position while preserving the underlying physics of wave propagation. Our model is validated through finite element method simulations and over-the-air experiments, demonstrating millimeter-scale accuracy in predicting reflections. Our model provides a foundation for future curving beam communication and sensing systems, enabling the design of reflected curved links and curving radar paths.

Title: Resilient UAV Data Mule via Adaptive Sensor Association under Timing Constraints
Authors: Md Sharif Hossen, Anil Gurses, Ozgur Ozdemir, Mihail Sichitiu, Ismail Guvenc
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be critical for time-sensitive data collection missions, yet existing research often relies on simulations that fail to capture real-world complexities. Many studies assume ideal wireless conditions or focus only on path planning, neglecting the challenge of making real-time decisions in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we address the problem of adaptive sensor selection for a data-gathering UAV, considering both the buffered data at each sensor and realistic propagation conditions. We introduce the Hover-based Greedy Adaptive Download (HGAD) strategy, designed to maximize data transfer by intelligently hovering over sensors during periods of peak signal quality. We validate HGAD using both a digital twin (DT) and a real-world (RW) testbed at the NSF-funded AERPAW platform. Our experiments show that HGAD significantly improves download stability and successfully meets per-sensor data targets. When compared with the traditional Greedy approach that simply follows the strongest signal, HGAD is shown to outperform in the cumulative data download. This work demonstrates the importance of integrating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware and buffer-aware scheduling with DT and RW signal traces to design resilient UAV data-mule strategies for realistic deployments.

Title: Discriminative-Generative Target Speaker Extraction with Decoder-Only Language Models
Authors: Bang Zeng, Beilong Tang, Wang Xiang, Ming Li
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to recover the speech signal of a desired speaker from a mixed audio recording, given a short enrollment utterance. Most existing TSE approaches are based on discriminative modeling paradigms. Although effective at suppressing interfering speakers, these methods often struggle to produce speech with high perceptual quality and naturalness. To address this limitation, we first propose LauraTSE, a generative TSE model built upon an auto-regressive decoder-only language model. However, purely generative approaches may suffer from hallucinations, content drift, and limited controllability, which may undermine their reliability in complex acoustic scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we further introduce a discriminative-generative TSE framework. In this framework, a discriminative front-end is employed to robustly extract the target speaker's speech, yielding stable and controllable intermediate representations. A generative back-end then operates in the neural audio codec representation space to reconstruct fine-grained speech details and enhance perceptual quality. This two-stage design effectively combines the robustness and controllability of discriminative models with the superior naturalness and quality enhancement capabilities of generative models. Moreover, we systematically investigate collaborative training strategies for the proposed framework, including freezing or fine-tuning the front-end, incorporating an auxiliary SI-SDR loss, and exploring both auto-regressive and non-auto-regressive inference mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a more favorable trade-off among speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

Title: Cooperative Differential GNSS Positioning: Estimators and Bounds
Authors: Helena Calatrava, Daniel Medina, Pau Closas
Abstract: In Differential GNSS (DGNSS) positioning, differencing measurements between a user and a reference station suppresses common-mode errors but also introduces reference-station noise, which fundamentally limits accuracy. This limitation is minor for high-grade stations but becomes significant when using reference infrastructure of mixed quality. This paper investigates how large-scale user cooperation can mitigate the impact of reference-station noise in conventional (non-cooperative) DGNSS systems. We develop a unified estimation framework for cooperative DGNSS (C-DGNSS) and cooperative real-time kinematic (C-RTK) positioning, and derive parameterized expressions for their Fisher information matrices as functions of network size, satellite geometry, and reference-station noise. This formulation enables theoretical analysis of estimation performance, identifying regimes where cooperation asymptotically restores the accuracy of DGNSS with an ideal (noise-free) reference. Simulations validate these theoretical findings.

Title: CosyEdit: Unlocking End-to-End Speech Editing Capability from Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Models
Authors: Junyang Chen, Yuhang Jia, Hui Wang, Jiaming Zhou, Yaxin Han, Mengying Feng, Yong Qin
Abstract: Automatic speech editing aims to modify spoken content based on textual instructions, yet traditional cascade systems suffer from complex preprocessing pipelines and a reliance on explicit external temporal alignment. Addressing these limitations, we propose CosyEdit, an end-to-end speech editing model adapted from CosyVoice through task-specific fine-tuning and an optimized inference procedure, which internalizes speech-text alignment while ensuring high consistency between the speech before and after editing. By fine-tuning on only 250 hours of supervised data from our curated GigaEdit dataset, our 400M-parameter model achieves reliable speech editing performance. Experiments on the RealEdit benchmark indicate that CosyEdit not only outperforms several billion-parameter language model baselines but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art cascade approaches. These results demonstrate that, with task-specific fine-tuning and inference optimization, robust and efficient speech editing capabilities can be unlocked from a zero-shot TTS model, yielding a novel and cost-effective end-to-end solution for high-quality speech editing.

Title: Sketch&Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation
Authors: Yuang Shi, Simone Gasparini, Géraldine Morin, Wei Tsang Ooi
Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail. In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

Title: Closing the Modality Reasoning Gap for Speech Large Language Models
Authors: Chaoren Wang, Heng Lu, Xueyao Zhang, Shujie Liu, Yan Lu, Jinyu Li, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: Although speech large language models have achieved notable progress, a substantial modality reasoning gap remains: their reasoning performance on speech inputs is markedly weaker than on text. This gap could be associated with representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework that aligns text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories through an asymmetric reward design. The framework employs two dense and complementary signals: representation alignment, which measures layer-wise hidden-state similarity between speech- and text-conditioned trajectories, and behavior alignment, which evaluates semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.

Title: SPAM: Style Prompt Adherence Metric for Prompt-based TTS
Authors: Chanhee Cho, Nayeon Kim, Bugeun Kim
Abstract: Prompt-based text-to-speech (TTS) aims to generate speech that adheres to fine-grained style cues provided in a text prompt. However, most prior works depend on neither plausible nor faithful measures to evaluate prompt adherence. That is, they cannot ensure whether the evaluation is grounded on the prompt and is similar to a human. Thus, we present a new automatic metric, the Style Prompt Adherence Metric, which explicitly satisfies both plausibility and faithfulness. Inspired by the CLAP, our approach factorizes speech into acoustic attributes and aligns them with the style prompt. Also, we trained the scorer with a supervised contrastive loss, which could provide a clearer distinction between different semantics. We conducted two experiments on two perspectives. The plausibility experiment showed that SPAM achieved a strong correlation with the mean opinion score (MOS). Also, the faithfulness experiment demonstrated that SPAM is successfully grounded to the given style prompt, as it can discriminate different semantics of the prompt. We believe that SPAM can provide a viable automatic solution for evaluating style prompt adherence of synthesized speech.

Title: The ICASSP 2026 HumDial Challenge: Benchmarking Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems in the LLM Era
Authors: Zhixian Zhao, Shuiyuan Wang, Guojian Li, Hongfei Xue, Chengyou Wang, Shuai Wang, Longshuai Xiao, Zihan Zhang, Hui Bu, Xin Xu, Xinsheng Wang, Hexin Liu, Eng Siong Chng, Hung-yi Lee, Haizhou Li, Lei Xie
Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Audio-LLMs and Omni-models, spoken dialogue systems have evolved significantly, progressively narrowing the gap between human-machine and human-human interactions. Achieving truly ``human-like'' communication necessitates a dual capability: emotional intelligence to perceive and resonate with users' emotional states, and robust interaction mechanisms to navigate the dynamic, natural flow of conversation, such as real-time turn-taking. Therefore, we launched the first Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) at ICASSP 2026 to benchmark these dual capabilities. Anchored by a sizable dataset derived from authentic human conversations, this initiative establishes a fair evaluation platform across two tracks: (1) Emotional Intelligence, targeting long-term emotion understanding and empathetic generation; and (2) Full-Duplex Interaction, systematically evaluating real-time decision-making under `` listening-while-speaking'' conditions. This paper summarizes the dataset, track configurations, and the final results.

Title: GenCtrl -- A Formal Controllability Toolkit for Generative Models
Authors: Emily Cheng, Carmen Amo Alonso, Federico Danieli, Arno Blaas, Luca Zappella, Pau Rodriguez, Xavier Suau
Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

Title: On the Complexity of Electromagnetic Far-Field Modeling
Authors: Torben Kölle, Alexander Stutz-Tirri, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Modern wireless systems are envisioned to employ antenna architectures that not only transmit and receive electromagnetic (EM) waves, but also intentionally reflect and possibly transform incident EM waves. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous framework grounded in Maxwell's equations for analyzing the complexity of EM far-field modeling of general antenna architectures. We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters. Furthermore, we construct a sequence of finite-rank operators whose approximation error decays super-exponentially once the operator rank exceeds an effective bandwidth associated with the antenna architecture and the analysis frequency. These results constitute a fundamental prerequisite for the efficient and accurate modeling of general antenna architectures on digital computing platforms.

Title: Secure Multiuser Beamforming With Movable Antenna Arrays
Authors: Zhenqiao Cheng, Chongjun Ouyang, Boqun Zhao, Xingqi Zhang
Abstract: A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.

Title: Age of Gossip With Cellular Drone Mobility
Authors: Arunabh Srivastava, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider a cellular network containing $n$ nodes where nodes within a cell gossip with each other in a fully-connected fashion and a source shares updates with these nodes via a mobile drone. The mobile drone receives updates directly from the source and shares them with nodes in the cell where it currently resides. The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $\lambda_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $\lambda_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $\lambda_d(n)$, but not on $\lambda_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes. If $\lambda_d(n) \gg \lambda_m(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_m(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_d(n)$. If $\lambda_m(n) \gg \lambda_d(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_d(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_m(n)$.

Title: Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem
Authors: Sunia Tanweer, Firas A. Khasawneh
Abstract: We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.

Title: DYRECT Computed Tomography: DYnamic Reconstruction of Events on a Continuous Timescale
Authors: Wannes Goethals, Tom Bultreys, Steffen Berg, Matthieu N. Boone, Jan Aelterman
Abstract: Time-resolved high-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (4D $\mu$CT) is an imaging technique that offers insight into the evolution of dynamic processes inside materials that are opaque to visible light. Conventional tomographic reconstruction techniques are based on recording a sequence of 3D images that represent the sample state at different moments in time. This frame-based approach limits the temporal resolution compared to dynamic radiography experiments due to the time needed to make CT scans. Moreover, it leads to an inflation of the amount of data and thus to costly post-processing computations to quantify the dynamic behaviour from the sequence of time frames, hereby often ignoring the temporal correlations of the sample structure. Our proposed 4D $\mu$CT reconstruction technique, named DYRECT, estimates individual attenuation evolution profiles for each position in the sample. This leads to a novel memory-efficient event-based representation of the sample, using as little as three image volumes: its initial attenuation, its final attenuation and the transition times. This third volume represents local events on a continuous timescale instead of the discrete global time frames. We propose a method to iteratively reconstruct the transition times and the attenuation volumes. The dynamic reconstruction technique was validated on synthetic ground truth data and experimental data, and was found to effectively pinpoint the transition times in the synthetic dataset with a time resolution corresponding to less than a tenth of the amount of projections required to reconstruct traditional $\mu$CT time frames.

Title: AsyMov: Integrated Sensing and Communications with Asynchronous Moving Devices
Authors: Gianmaria Ventura, Michele Rossi, Jacopo Pegoraro
Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the key objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, as it enables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition, and gait analysis. In practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by the movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets caused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed these two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or asynchronous static ones. In fact, jointly tackling device motion and clock asynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement differs for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In this work, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target and its velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and asynchronous devices. It leverages the channel impulse response at the receiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across propagation paths and the bistatic geometry, where the target Doppler and the device velocity are jointly estimated by a newly proposed alternating minimization algorithm. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with device velocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), for enhanced reliability. Here, AsyMov is thoroughly characterized by way of theory (Cramér-Rao bound), simulation, and experiments, implementing it on an IEEE 802.11ay testbed and testing it on multiple setups in the 60 GHz and 28 GHz bands, including moving human subjects. Numerical and experimental results show superior performance against state-of-the-art methods and are on par with scenarios featuring static ISAC devices.

Title: Battery State of Health Estimation and Incremental Capacity Analysis under Dynamic Charging Profile Using Neural Networks
Authors: Qinan Zhou, Gabrielle Vuylsteke, R. Dyche Anderson, Jing Sun
Abstract: Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) are two effective approaches for battery degradation monitoring. One limiting factor for their real-world application is that they require constant-current (CC) charging profiles. This research removes this limitation and proposes an approach that extends ICA/DVA-based degradation monitoring from CC charging to dynamic charging profiles. A novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (VIC) and virtual differential voltage (VDV) is proposed. Then, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct VIC/VDV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from dynamic charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) range that satisfies some constraints. Finally, two CNNs called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net are proposed as replacements for the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, to reduce the computational footprint and memory requirements, while keeping similar performance. Using an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules, the proposed CNNs are demonstrated to provide accurate VIC/VDV curves and enable ICA/DVA-based battery degradation monitoring under various fast-charging protocols and different SOC ranges.

Title: TransDOA: Calibrating Array Imperfections via Transformer-based Transfer Learning
Authors: Bo Zhou, Kaijie Xu, Yinghui Quan, Mengdao Xing
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections. In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

Title: InnerGS: Internal Scenes Reconstruction and Segmentation via Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Shuxin Liang, Yihan Xiao, Wenlu Tang
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Beyond high-fidelity reconstruction, we further demonstrate the framework's potential for downstream tasks such as segmentation. By integrating language features, we extend our approach to enable text-guided segmentation of medical scenes via natural language queries. Our approach eliminates the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at: this https URL.

Title: Intelligent Multimodal Multi-Sensor Fusion-Based UAV Identification, Localization, and Countermeasures for Safeguarding Low-Altitude Economy
Authors: Yi Tao, Zhen Gao, Fangquan Ye, Jingbo Xu, Tao Song, Weidong Li, Yu Su, Lu Peng, Xiaomei Wu, Tong Qin, Zhongxiang Li, Dezhi Zheng
Abstract: The development of the low-altitude economy has led to a growing prominence of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) safety management issues. Therefore, accurate identification, real-time localization, and effective countermeasures have become core challenges in airspace security assurance. This paper introduces an integrated UAV management and control system based on deep learning, which integrates multimodal multi-sensor fusion perception, precise positioning, and collaborative countermeasures. By incorporating deep learning methods, the system combines radio frequency (RF) spectral feature analysis, radar detection, electro-optical identification, and other methods at the detection level to achieve the identification and classification of UAVs. At the localization level, the system relies on multi-sensor data fusion and the air-space-ground integrated communication network to conduct real-time tracking and prediction of UAV flight status, providing support for early warning and decision-making. At the countermeasure level, it adopts comprehensive measures that integrate ``soft kill'' and ``hard kill'', including technologies such as electromagnetic signal jamming, navigation spoofing, and physical interception, to form a closed-loop management and control process from early warning to final disposal, which significantly enhances the response efficiency and disposal accuracy of low-altitude UAV management.

Title: Orthogonal-by-construction augmentation of physics-based input-output models
Authors: Bendegúz M. Györök, Maarten Schoukens, Tamás Péni, Roland Tóth
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel orthogonal-by-construction parametrization for augmenting physics-based input-output models with a learning component in an additive sense. The parametrization allows to jointly optimize the parameters of the physics-based model and the learning component. Unlike the commonly applied additive (parallel) augmentation structure, the proposed formulation eliminates overlap in representation of the system dynamics, thereby preserving the uniqueness of the estimated physical parameters, ultimately leading to enhanced model interpretability. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild conditions, the method is statistically consistent and guarantees recovery of the true physical parameters. With further analysis regarding the asymptotic covariance matrix of the identified parameters, we also prove that the proposed structure provides a clear separation between the physics-based and learning components of the augmentation structure. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation studies, showing accurate reproduction of the data-generating dynamics without sacrificing consistent estimation of the physical parameters.

Title: Model-free Adaptive Output Feedback Vibration Suppression in a Cantilever Beam
Authors: Juan Augusto Paredes Salazar, Ankit Goel
Abstract: This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.

Title: Pivot-Only Azimuthal Control and Attitude Estimation of Balloon-borne Payloads
Authors: Philippe Voyer, Simon Tartakovsky, Steven J. Benton, William C. Jones
Abstract: This paper presents an attitude estimation and yaw-rate control framework for balloon-borne payloads using pivot-only actuation, motivated by the Taurus experiment. Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.

Title: Invisible Walls: Privacy-Preserving ISAC Empowered by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Yinghui He (1), Long Fan (2), Lei Xie (2), Dusit Niyato (1), Chau Yuen (1), Jun Luo (1) ((1) Nanyang Technological University, (2) Nanjing University)
Abstract: The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.

Title: Communication-Efficient Stochastic Distributed Learning
Authors: Xiaoxing Ren, Nicola Bastianello, Karl H. Johansson, Thomas Parisini
Abstract: We address distributed learning problems, both nonconvex and convex, over undirected networks. In particular, we design a novel algorithm based on the distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address the challenges of high communication costs, and large datasets. Our design tackles these challenges i) by enabling the agents to perform multiple local training steps between each round of communications; and ii) by allowing the agents to employ stochastic gradients while carrying out local computations. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point, for nonconvex problems, and of an optimal point, for convex problems. We also propose a variant of the algorithm to incorporate variance reduction thus achieving exact convergence. We show that the resulting algorithm indeed converges to a stationary (or optimal) point, and moreover that local training accelerates convergence. We thoroughly compare the proposed algorithms with the state of the art, both theoretically and through numerical results.

Title: Subject-driven Video Generation via Disentangled Identity and Motion
Authors: Daneul Kim, Jingxu Zhang, Wonjoon Jin, Sunghyun Cho, Qi Dai, Jaesik Park, Chong Luo
Abstract: We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation. In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image customization dataset directly on training video customization models, factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method. Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Title: Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models
Authors: Shunpu Tang, Yuanyuan Jia, Qianqian Yang, Ruichen Zhang, Jihong Park, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.

Title: Dense 3D Displacement Estimation for Landslide Monitoring via Fusion of TLS Point Clouds and Embedded RGB Images
Authors: Zhaoyi Wang, Jemil Avers Butt, Shengyu Huang, Tomislav Medic, Andreas Wieser
Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. Existing point cloud-based methods, however, typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partitioning-based coarse-to-fine approach that integrates 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. Patch-level matches are constructed using both 3D geometry and 2D image features, refined via geometric consistency checks, and followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that the proposed method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references, all below the mean scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Compared with the state-of-the-art method F2S3, the proposed approach improves spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. The proposed approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. The example data and source code are publicly available at this https URL.

Title: The factorization of matrices into products of positive definite factors
Authors: Mahmoud Abdelgalil, Tryphon T. Georgiou
Abstract: Positive-definite matrices materialize as state transition matrices of linear time-invariant gradient flows, and the composition of such materializes as the state transition after successive steps where the driving potential is suitably adjusted. Thus, factoring an arbitrary matrix (with positive determinant) into a product of positive-definite ones provides the needed schedule for a time-varying potential to have a desired effect. The present work provides a detailed analysis of this factorization problem by lifting it into a sequence of Monge-Kantorovich transportation steps on Gaussian distributions and studying the induced holonomy of the optimal transportation problem. From this vantage point we determine the minimal number of positive-definite factors that have a desired effect on the spectrum of the product, e.g., ensure specified eigenvalues or being a rotation matrix. Our approach is computational and allows to identify the needed number of factors as well as trade off their conditioning number with their actual number.

Authors: Sourav Banerjee, Neel Kanth Kundu
Abstract: Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection. This paper presents a system model and performance analysis of a Rydberg atom-based quantum radar, which employs optical readout via lasers and photon detectors instead of circuit-based receivers. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare it with classical radar, and estimate Doppler frequency using an invariant function-based method. Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.

Title: Selection-Induced Contraction of Innovation Statistics in Gated Kalman Filters
Authors: Barak Or
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.

Title: Hierarchical GNN-Based Multi-Agent Learning for Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane and Emergency Vehicle Corridor Formation
Authors: Haoran Su
Abstract: Emergency vehicles require rapid passage through congested traffic, yet existing strategies fail to adapt to dynamic conditions. We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.
