Title: Stronger is not better: Better Augmentations in Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Azeez Idris, Abdurahman Ali Mohammed, Samuel Fanijo
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning is among the recent representation learning methods that have shown performance gains in several downstream tasks including semantic segmentation. This paper evaluates strong data augmentation, one of the most important components for self-supervised contrastive learning's improved performance. Strong data augmentation involves applying the composition of multiple augmentation techniques on images. Surprisingly, we find that the existing data augmentations do not always improve performance for semantic segmentation for medical images. We experiment with other augmentations that provide improved performance.

Title: KidSpeak: A General Multi-purpose LLM for Kids' Speech Recognition and Screening
Authors: Rohan Sharma, Dancheng Liu, Jingchen Sun, Shijie Zhou, Jiayu Qin, Jinjun Xiong, Changyou Chen
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of conversational and diffusion-based AI, there is a growing adoption of AI in educational services, ranging from grading and assessment tools to personalized learning systems that provide targeted support for students. However, this adaptability has yet to fully extend to the domain of children's speech, where existing models often fail due to their reliance on datasets designed for clear, articulate adult speech. Children, particularly those in early developmental stages or with speech and language pathologies, present unique challenges that current AI models and datasets are ill-equipped to handle. To address this, we introduce KidSpeak, a multi-task speech-enhanced Foundation Model capable of both generative and discriminative tasks specifically tailored to children's speech patterns. Our framework employs a two-stage training process that incorporates phonetic knowledge into the speech encoder, achieving an average accuracy of 87% across four separate tasks. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of scalable human annotation and existing speech alignment tools, we propose the Flexible and Automatic Speech Aligner (FASA) and leverage the method to construct high quality datasets for training and evaluation. This novel alignment tool significantly improves the quality of aligned children's speech from noisy data, enhancing data quality by 13.6x compared to human annotations, as demonstrated on the CHILDES dataset. To the best of our knowledge, KidSpeak and FASA represent the first comprehensive solution designed for speech and language therapy in children, offering both a multi-purpose speech LLM and a robust alignment tool.

Title: Semantic Temporal Single-photon LiDAR
Authors: Fang Li, Tonglin Mu, Shuling Li, Junran Guo, Keyuan Li, Jianing Li, Ziyang Luo, Xiaodong Fan, Ye Chen, Yunfeng Liu, Hong Cai, Lip Ket Chin, Jinbei Zhang, Shihai Sun
Abstract: Temporal single-photon (TSP-) LiDAR presents a promising solution for imaging-free target recognition over long distances with reduced size, cost, and power consumption. However, existing TSP-LiDAR approaches are ineffective in handling open-set scenarios where unknown targets emerge, and they suffer significant performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and short acquisition times (fewer photons). Here, inspired by semantic communication, we propose a semantic TSP-LiDAR based on a self-updating semantic knowledge base (SKB), in which the target recognition processing of TSP-LiDAR is formulated as a semantic communication. The results, both simulation and experiment, demonstrate that our approach surpasses conventional methods, particularly under challenging conditions of low SNR and limited acquisition time. More importantly, our self-updating SKB mechanism can dynamically update the semantic features of newly encountered targets in the SKB, enabling continuous adaptation without the need for extensive retraining of the neural network. In fact, a recognition accuracy of 89% is achieved on nine types of unknown targets in real-world experiments, compared to 66% without the updating mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for adaptive and robust target recognition in complex and dynamic environments.

Title: Why Nonlinear Models Matter: Unified Analysis of Cognitive Load, Stress, and Exercise Using Wearable Physiological Signals
Authors: Khondakar Ashik Shahriar
Abstract: Wearable physiological signals exhibit strong nonlinear and subject-dependent behavior, challenging traditional linear models. This study provides a unified evaluation of cognitive load, stress, and physical exercise recognition using three public Empatica~E4 datasets. Across all conditions, nonlinear machine learning models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving 0.89--0.98 accuracy and 0.96--0.99 ROC--AUC, while linear models remained below 0.70--0.73 AUC. Although Leave-One-Subject-Out validation revealed substantial inter-individual variability, nonlinear models maintained moderate cross-person generalization. Ablation and statistical analyses confirmed the necessity of multimodal fusion, particularly EDA, temperature, and ACC, while SHAP interpretability validated these findings by uncovering physiologically meaningful feature contributions across tasks. Overall, the results demonstrate that physiological state recognition is fundamentally nonlinear and establish a unified benchmark to guide the development of more robust wearable health-monitoring systems.

Title: Variable L0 Guidance Strategy: Enlarged Operational Envelope and Path-Following
Authors: Amit Shivam, Manuel C.R.M. Fernandes, Fernando A.C.C. Fontes, Lorenzo Fagiano
Abstract: This paper presents a geometric and theoretical study of an exponentially varying look-ahead parameter for UAV path-following guidance. Conventional guidance laws with a fixed look-ahead distance often drive the vehicle into turn-rate saturation when the heading or cross-track error is large, leading to constrained maneuvers and higher control effort. The proposed variable L0 strategy reshapes the look-ahead profile so that the guidance command adapts to the evolving tracking error geometry. A detailed investigation shows that this adaptation significantly enlarges the region in which the commanded turn rate remains unsaturated, allowing the vehicle to operate smoothly over a broader range of error conditions. For representative settings, the unsaturated operational envelope increases by more than 70% relative to the constant L0 formulation. These geometric insights translate to smoother trajectories, earlier recovery from saturation, and reduced control demand. Simulation studies on straight-line and elliptical paths demonstrate the merits of the variable look-ahead strategy, highlighting its control-efficient and reliable path-following performance.

Title: A Nonlinear Observer for Air-Velocity and Attitude Estimation Using Pitot and Barometric Measurements
Authors: Melone Nyoba Tchonkeu, Soulaimane Berkane, Tarek Hamel
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating air velocity and full attitude for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied environments using minimal onboard sensing-an interesting and practically relevant challenge for UAV navigation. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (i) an observability analysis establishing the conditions for uniform observability, which are useful for trajectory planning and motion control of the UAV; and (ii) the design of a nonlinear observer on SO3R3R that incorporates pitot-tube, barometric altitude, and magnetometer measurements as outputs, with IMU data used as inputs, within a unified framework. Simulation results are presented to confirm the convergence and robustness of the proposed design, including under minimally excited trajectories.

Title: Sparse Neural Approximations for Bilevel Adversarial Problems in Power Grids
Authors: Young-ho Cho, Harsha Nagarajan, Deepjyoti Deka, Hao Zhu
Abstract: The adversarial worst-case load shedding (AWLS) problem is pivotal for identifying critical contingencies under line outages. It is naturally cast as a bilevel program: the upper level simulates an attacker determining worst-case line failures, and the lower level corresponds to the defender's generator redispatch operations. Conventional techniques using optimality conditions render the bilevel, mixed-integer formulation computationally prohibitive due to the combinatorial number of topologies and the nonconvexity of AC power flow constraints. To address these challenges, we develop a novel single-level optimal value-function (OVF) reformulation and further leverage a data-driven neural network (NN) surrogate of the follower's optimal value. To ensure physical realizability, we embed the trained surrogate in a physics-constrained NN (PCNN) formulation that couples the OVF inequality with (relaxed) AC feasibility, yielding a mixed-integer convex model amenable to off-the-shelf solvers. To achieve scalability, we learn a sparse, area-partitioned NN via spectral clustering; the resulting block-sparse architecture scales essentially linearly with system size while preserving accuracy. Notably, our approach produces near-optimal worst-case failures and generalizes across loading conditions and unseen topologies, enabling rapid online recomputation. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems demonstrate the method's scalability and solution quality for large-scale contingency analysis, with an average optimality gap of 5.8% compared to conventional methods, while maintaining computation times under one minute.

Title: Explainable LP-MPC: Shadow Price Contributions Reveal MV-CV Pairings
Authors: Lim C. Siang, Daniel L. O'Connor
Abstract: Large industrial LP-MPC (Linear Program-Model Predictive Control) systems contain tens to hundreds of manipulated variables (MVs) and controlled variables (CVs) for honoring constraints while operating at plant-wide economic optima. The LP is a white-box model, yet for a number of reasons, abnormal behaviors in industrial controllers are often difficult to rationalize. We introduce a novel, post-hoc LP explainability method by recasting the role of shadow prices in the LP solution as an attribution mechanism for MV-CV relationships. The core idea is that CV shadow prices are not just intrinsic properties of the optimal solution, but an aggregate of the cost sensitivities contributed by MVs in enforcing CV constraints, which is then resolved into one-to-one MV-CV pairings using a linear sum assignment solution. The proposed MV-CV pairing framework serves as a practical explainability tool for online LP-MPC systems, enabling practitioners to diagnose suboptimal constraints and verify alignment of the controller's behavior with its original design intent and historical constraints.

Title: Beamspace Dimensionality Reduction for Massive MU-MIMO: Geometric Insights and Information-Theoretic Limits
Authors: Canan Cebeci, Oveys Delafrooz Noroozi, Upamanyu Madhow
Abstract: Beamspace dimensionality reduction, a classical tool in array processing, has been shown in recent work to significantly reduce computational complexity and training overhead for adaptive reception in massive multiuser (MU) MIMO. For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting.

Title: A Physics-Informed Fixed Skyroad Model for Continuous UAS Traffic Management (C-UTM)
Authors: Muhammad Junayed Hasan Zahed, Hossein Rastgoftar
Abstract: Unlike traditional multi-agent coordination frameworks, which assume a fixed number of agents, UAS traffic management (UTM) requires a platform that enables Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) to freely enter or exit constrained low-altitude airspace. Consequently, the number of UAS operating in a given region is time-varying, with vehicles dynamically joining or leaving even in dense, obstacle-laden environments. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a computationally efficient management system that maximizes airspace usability while ensuring safety and efficiency. To achieve this, we first introduce physics-informed methods to structure fixed skyroads across multiple altitude layers of urban airspace, with the directionality of each skyroad designed to guarantee full reachability. We then present a novel Continuous UTM (C-UTM) framework that optimally allocates skyroads to UAS requests while accounting for the time-varying capacity of the airspace. Collectively, the proposed model addresses the key challenges of low-altitude UTM by providing a scalable, safe, and efficient solution for urban airspace usability.

Title: Scale-free weak output synchronization of multi-agent systems with adaptive protocols
Authors: Anton A. Stoorvogel, Ali Saberi, Zhenwei Liu, Qiaofeng Wen
Abstract: In this paper, we study output synchronization for multi-agent systems. The objective is to design a protocol which only depends on the agent dynamics and does not require any knowledge of the network. If the network has a directed spanning tree then the protocols designed in this paper achieve classical output synchronization. Otherwise, the protocol achieves weak synchronization which is induced by network stability in the sense that the signals exchanged over the network converge to zero. Weak sychronization is explained in detail in this paper. Even though we consider linear agents, it is known that this in general requires nonlinear protocols. In the paper we use adaptive protocols. In the literature, two classes of protocols are considered often called collaborative protocols (with additional communication between the protocols and non-collaborative protocols (sometimes referred to as fully decentralized where the additional communication is not present). This paper considers both of these cases.

Title: Optimal Platoon Formation and Stable Benefit Allocation in Mixed-Energy Truck Fleets under Size Limitations
Authors: Ting Bai, Xinfeng Ru, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cooperative platoon formation and benefit allocation in mixed-energy truck fleets composed of both electric and fuel-powered trucks. The central challenge arises from the platoon-size constraint, which limits the number of trucks permitted in each platoon and introduces combinatorial coupling into the search for optimal platoon formation structures. We formulate this problem as a coalitional game with bounded coalition sizes and derive a closed-form characterization of the optimal coalition structure that maximizes the fleet-wide platooning benefit. Building on this structure, we develop a type-based least-core payoff allocation scheme that guarantees stability within the coalition-structure core (CS-core). For cases in which the CS-core is empty, we compute the least-core radius to determine the minimal relaxation required to achieve approximate stability. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves the highest total platooning benefit among all feasible formation configurations while providing stable benefit allocations that outperform existing baseline methods.

Title: Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter
Authors: Minhyuk Jang, Astghik Hakobyan, Insoon Yang
Abstract: In this work, we propose a noise-centric formulation of the distributionally robust Kalman filter (DRKF) for discrete-time linear stochastic systems with uncertain noise statistics. By placing Wasserstein ambiguity sets directly on the process and measurement noise distributions, the proposed DRKF preserves the analytical structure of the classical Kalman filter while providing a priori spectral bounds on all feasible covariances. In the time-invariant setting, we derive a steady-state DRKF from a single stationary semidefinite program, yielding a constant-gain estimator with the same per-step computational complexity as the standard Kalman filter. We establish conditions guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of this steady-state solution, and we prove its asymptotic minimax optimality with respect to the worst-case mean-square error. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that the proposed DRKF improves estimation accuracy under unknown or uncertain noise models while offering computational advantages over existing robust and distributionally robust filters.

Title: A Hybrid Physics-Based and Reinforcement Learning Framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Time Prediction
Authors: Praharshitha Aryasomayajula, Ting Bai, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a hybrid prediction framework for accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging time estimation, a capability that is critical for trip planning, user satisfaction, and efficient operation of charging infrastructure. We combine a physics-based analytical model with a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The analytical component captures the nonlinear constant-current/constant-voltage (CC--CV) charging dynamics and explicitly models state-of-health (SoH)--dependent capacity and power fade, providing a reliable baseline when historical data are limited. Building on this foundation, we introduce an RL component that progressively refines charging-time predictions as operational data accumulate, enabling improved long-term adaptation. Both models incorporate SoH degradation to maintain predictive accuracy over the battery lifetime. We evaluate the framework using $5{,}000$ simulated charging sessions calibrated to manufacturer specifications and publicly available EV charging datasets. Our results show that the analytical model achieves $R^{2}=98.5\%$ and $\mathrm{MAPE}=2.1\%$, while the RL model further improves performance to $R^{2}=99.2\%$ and $\mathrm{MAPE}=1.6\%$, corresponding to a $23\%$ accuracy gain and $35\%$ improved robustness to battery aging.

Title: Degrading Voice: A Comprehensive Overview of Robust Voice Conversion Through Input Manipulation
Authors: Xining Song, Zhihua Wei, Rui Wang, Haixiao Hu, Yanxiang Chen, Meng Han
Abstract: Identity, accent, style, and emotions are essential components of human speech. Voice conversion (VC) techniques process the speech signals of two input speakers and other modalities of auxiliary information such as prompts and emotion tags. It changes para-linguistic features from one to another, while maintaining linguistic contents. Recently, VC models have made rapid advancements in both generation quality and personalization capabilities. These developments have attracted considerable attention for diverse applications, including privacy preservation, voice-print reproduction for the deceased, and dysarthric speech recovery. However, these models only learn non-robust features due to the clean training data. Subsequently, it results in unsatisfactory performances when dealing with degraded input speech in real-world scenarios, including additional noise, reverberation, adversarial attacks, or even minor perturbation. Hence, it demands robust deployments, especially in real-world settings. Although latest researches attempt to find potential attacks and countermeasures for VC systems, there remains a significant gap in the comprehensive understanding of how robust the VC model is under input manipulation. here also raises many questions: For instance, to what extent do different forms of input degradation attacks alter the expected output of VC models? Is there potential for optimizing these attack and defense strategies? To answer these questions, we classify existing attack and defense methods from the perspective of input manipulation and evaluate the impact of degraded input speech across four dimensions, including intelligibility, naturalness, timbre similarity, and subjective perception. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions.

Title: Control-Oriented System Identification: Classical, Learning, and Physics-Informed Approaches
Authors: S. Sivaranjani, Yuanyuan Shi, Nikolay Atanasov, Thai Duong, Jie Feng, Tim Martin, Yuezhu Xu, Vijay Gupta, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: We survey classical, machine learning, and data-driven system identification approaches to learn control-relevant and physics-informed models of dynamical systems. Recently, machine learning approaches have enabled system identification from noisy, high-dimensional, and complex data. However, their utility is limited by their ability to provide provable guarantees on control-relevant properties. Meanwhile, control theory has identified several properties that are useful in analysis and control synthesis, such as dissipativity, monotonicity, energy conservation, and symmetry-preserving structures. We posit that merging system identification with such control-relevant or physics-informed properties can provide useful inductive bias, enhance explainability, enable control synthesis with provable guarantees, and improve sample complexity. We formulate system identification as an optimization problem where control-relevant properties can be enforced through direct parameterization (constraining the model structure to satisfy a desired property by construction), soft constraints (encouraging control-relevant properties through regularization or penalty terms), and hard constraints (imposing control-relevant properties as constraints in the optimization problem). Through this lens, we survey methods to learn physics-informed and control-relevant models spanning classical linear and nonlinear system identification, machine learning approaches, and direct identification through data-driven and behavioral representations. We also provide several expository examples that are accompanied by code and brief tutorials on a public Github repository. We also describe challenging directions for future research, including identification in networked, switched, and time-varying systems, experiment design, and bridging the gaps between data-driven, learning-based, and control-oriented approaches.

Title: Data Generation for Stability Studies of Power Systems with High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: Francesca Rossi, Mauro Garcia Lorenzo, Eduardo Iraola de Acevedo, Elia Mateu Barriendos, Vinicius Albernaz Lacerda, Francesc Lordan-Gomis, Rosa Badia, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo
Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.

Title: Non-Equiprobable Signaling for Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread
Authors: Sandesh Rao Mattu, Nishant Mehrotra, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of OFDM systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling with low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. As the transmission rate increases, the gains from non-equiprobable signaling diminish, but we show through simulation that they are still significant for $16$-QAM.

Title: Scaling Wideband Hybrid Beamforming for sub-THz Communication
Authors: Amirmohammad Haddad, Oveys Delafrooz Noroozi, Canan Cebeci, Mark J. W. Rodwell, Upamanyu Madhow
Abstract: We investigate the capacity attainable for a multiuser MIMO uplink as we scale both array size and bandwidth for regimes in which all-digital arrays incur excessive hardware complexity and power consumption. We consider a tiled hybrid beamforming architecture in which each tile, or subarray, is a phased array performing analog (or RF) beamforming, followed by DSP on the tile outputs. For parameters compatible with sub-THz fixed access links, we discuss hardware and power consumption considerations for choosing tile size and the number of tiles. Noting that the problem of optimal multiuser MIMO in our wideband regime is open even for the simplest possible channel models, we compare the spectral efficiencies attainable by a number of reasonable strategies for tile-level RF beamforming, assuming flexibility in the digital signal processing (DSP) of the tile outputs. We consider a number of beam broadening approaches for addressing the ``beam squint'' incurred by RF beamforming in our wideband regime, along with strategies for sharing tiles among users. Information-theoretic benchmarks are computed for an idealized MIMO-OFDM system, with linear per-subcarrier multiuser detection compared against an unconstrained complexity receiver.

Title: The E-Rocket: Low-cost Testbed for TVC Rocket GNC Validation
Authors: Pedro Santos, André Fonte, Pedro Martins, Paulo Oliveira
Abstract: This paper presents the E-Rocket, an electric-powered, low-cost rocket prototype for validation of Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) algorithms based on Thrust Vector Control (TVC). Relying on commercially available components and 3D printed parts, a pair of contra-rotating DC brushless motors is assembled on a servo-actuated gimbal mechanism that provides thrust vectoring capability. A custom avionics hardware and software stack is developed considering a dual computer setup which leverages the capabilities of the PX4 autopilot and the modularity of ROS 2 to accommodate for tailored GNC algorithms. The platform is validated in an indoor motion-capture arena using a baseline PID-based trajectory tracking controller. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking and confirm the suitability of the E-Rocket as a versatile testbed for rocket GNC algorithms.

Title: Scaling Wideband Massive MIMO Radar via Tiled Beamspace Processing
Authors: Oveys Delafrooz Noroozi, Jiyoon Han, Wei Tang, Zhengya Zhang, Upamanyu Madhow
Abstract: We present a coordinated tiled architecture for scalable wideband digital beamforming in massive MIMO radar systems. As aperture size increases, conventional full-array MVDR processing becomes prohibitive due to the cubic complexity of covariance estimation and inversion. Building on the principle of energy concentration in beamspace, we introduce a tiled windowed-beamspace MVDR framework that distributes spatial FFT processing across subarrays while performing joint beamforming in a compact global beamspace domain. Each tile applies a 2D spatial DFT followed by an angle-of-arrival dependent beamspace window, producing a reduced-dimensional representation that preserves the dominant spatial structure of the received signal. The windowed outputs from the tiles are concatenated and processed by a centralized MVDR beamformer, enabling coherent full-aperture processing with drastically reduced dimensionality. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves detection and interference suppression performance comparable to full-dimensional processing, while substantially lowering computational cost, memory usage, and training requirements. The framework also reveals tradeoffs among tile size, window size, and beamspace resolution that govern overall system scalability.

Title: Deep Neural Network-Based Aerial Transport in the Presence of Cooperative and Uncooperative UAS
Authors: Muhammad Junayed Hasan Zahed, Hossein Rastgoftar
Abstract: We present a resilient deep neural network (DNN) framework for decentralized transport and coverage using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) operating in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The proposed DNN-based mass-transport architecture constructs a layered inter-UAS communication graph from an initial formation, assigns time-varying communication weights through a forward scheduling mechanism that guides the team from the initial to the final configuration, and ensures stability and convergence of the resulting multi-agent transport dynamics. The framework is explicitly designed to remain robust in the presence of uncooperative agents that deviate from or refuse to follow the prescribed protocol. Our method preserves a fixed feed-forward topology but dynamically prunes edges to uncooperative agents, maintains convex, feedforward mentoring among cooperative agents, and computes global desired set points through a sparse linear relation consistent with leader references. The target set is abstracted by $N$ points that become final desired positions, enabling coverage-optimal transport while keeping computation low and guarantees intact. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, under full cooperation, all agents converge rapidly to the target zone with a 10\% boundary margin and under partial cooperation with uncooperative agents, the system maintains high convergence among cooperative agents with performance degradation localized near the disruptions, evidencing graceful resilience and scalability. These results confirm that forward-weight scheduling, hierarchical mentor--mentee coordination, and on-the-fly DNN restructuring yield robust, provably stable UAS transport in realistic fault scenarios.

Title: Learning Reachability of Energy Storage Arbitrage
Authors: Tomás Tapia, Agustin Castellano, Enrique Mallada, Yury Dvorkin
Abstract: Power systems face increasing weather-driven variability and, therefore, increasingly rely on flexible but energy-limited storage resources. Energy storage can buffer this variability, but its value depends on intertemporal decisions under uncertain prices. Without accounting for the future reliability value of stored energy, batteries may act myopically, discharging too early or failing to preserve reserves during critical hours. This paper introduces a stopping-time reward that, together with a state-of-charge (SoC) range target penalty, aligns arbitrage incentives with system reliability by rewarding storage that maintains sufficient SoC before critical hours. We formulate the problem as an online optimization with a chance-constrained terminal SoC and embed it in an end-to-end (E2E) learning framework, jointly training the price predictor and control policy. The proposed design enhances reachability of target SoC ranges, improves profit under volatile conditions, and reduces its standard deviation.

Title: Sliding-Mode Control Strategies for PMSM: Benchmarking and Comparative Simulation Study
Authors: Mubarak Badamasi Aremu, Abdullah Ajasa, Ali Nasir
Abstract: Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are widely employed in high-performance drive systems owing to their high efficiency and power density. However, nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainties, and load disturbances complicate their control. Sliding-Mode Control (SMC) offers strong robustness but exists in numerous variants with unstandardized evaluation criteria. This paper presents a unified simulation benchmark and comparative analysis of six representative SMC techniques for PMSM speed regulation: conventional, integral, terminal, fractional-order, adaptive, and super-twisting. A standardized PMSM model, disturbance profile, and tuning protocol are adopted to ensure fair comparison across all methods. Performance is assessed through time-domain responses, integral error indices (ISE, IAE, ITSE, ITAE), and control-effort profiles, while also examining computational complexity and implementation feasibility. Results demonstrate that adaptive and higher-order SMCs, particularly the super-twisting and adaptive variants, achieve the most balanced trade-off between robustness, smoothness, and computational cost. The study provides a reproducible benchmarking framework, parameter-selection guidelines, and practical insights for designing efficient, low-chatter SMC-based PMSM drives suitable for real-time embedded implementation.

Title: Data-driven functional state estimation of complex networks
Authors: Yuan Zhang, Ziyuan Luo, Wenxuan Xu, Jiayu Wu, Wenqi Cao, Ranbo Cheng, Tingting Qin, Yuanqing Xia, Mohamed Darouach, Aming Li, Tyrone Fernando
Abstract: The internal state of a dynamical system, a set of variables that defines its evolving configuration, is often hidden and cannot be fully measured, posing a central challenge for real-time monitoring and control. While observers are designed to estimate these latent states from sensor outputs, their classical designs rely on precise system models, which are often unattainable for complex network systems. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework for estimating a targeted set of state variables, known as functional observers, without identifying the model parameters. We establish a fundamental functional observability criterion based on historical trajectories that guarantees the existence of such observers. We then develop methods to construct observers using either input-output data or partial state data. These observers match or exceed the performance of model-based counterparts while remaining applicable even to unobservable systems. The framework incorporates noise mitigation and can be easily extended to nonlinear networks via Koopman embeddings. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications including sensor fault detection in water networks, load-frequency control in power grids, and target estimation in nonlinear neuronal systems. Our work provides a practical route for real-time target state inference in complex systems where models are unavailable.

Title: Teaching large language models to see in radar: aspect-distributed prototypes for few-shot HRRP ATR
Authors: De Bi, Chengbai Xu, Lingfeng Chen, Panhe Hu
Abstract: High-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) play a critical role in automatic target recognition (ATR) due to their richinformationregarding target scattering centers (SCs), which encapsulate the geometric and electromagnetic characteristics of this http URL few-shot circumstances, traditional learning-based methods often suffer from overfitting and struggle togeneralizeeffectively. The recently proposed HRRPLLM, which leverages the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of largelanguagemodels (LLMs) for one-shot HRRP ATR, is limited in few-shot scenarios. This limitation arises because it primarilyutilizesthe distribution of SCs for recognition while neglecting the variance of the samples caused by aspect sensitivity. Thispaperproposes a straightforward yet effective Aspect-Distributed Prototype (ADP) strategy for LLM-based ATRunder few-shotconditions to enhance aspect robustness. Experiments conducted on both simulated and measured aircraft electromagneticdatasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current benchmarks.

Title: From Forecast to Action: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Power Outages During Tropical Cyclones
Authors: Yongchuan Yang, Naiyu Wang, Zhenguo Wang, Min Ouyang, Can Wan
Abstract: Power outages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) pose serious risks to electric power systems and the communities they serve. Accurate, high-resolution outage forecasting is essential for enabling both proactive mitigation planning and real-time emergency response. This study introduces the SpatioTemporal Outage ForeCAST (STO-CAST) model, a deep learning framework developed for real-time, regional-scale outage prediction during TC events with high-resolution outputs in both space and time. STO-CAST integrates static environmental and infrastructure attributes with dynamic meteorological and outage sequences using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully connected layers, and is trained via a Leave-One-Storm-Out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy along with holdout grid experiments to demonstrate its preliminary generalization capability to unseen storms and grids. The model produces hourly outage forecasts at a 4 km * 4 km resolution and supports dual forecasting modes: short-term nowcasting with a 6-hour lead time via assimilation of real-time observations, and long-term forecasting with a 60-hour lead time based on evolving meteorological projections. A case study on Typhoon Muifa (2022) demonstrates STO-CAST's operational effectiveness, including error decomposition across model design, meteorological uncertainty, and observation gaps, while highlighting the value of real-time data assimilation and the model's capacity to identify evolving outage hotspots. STO-CAST offers a scalable, data-driven solution to support risk-informed emergency response and enhance power system resilience under intensifying TC threats.

Abstract: The sixth-generation and beyond (B6G) networks are envisioned to support advanced applications that demand high-speed communication, high-precision sensing, and high-performance computing. To underpin this multi-functional evolution, energy- and cost-efficient programmable metasurfaces (PMs) have emerged as a promising technology for dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of representative multi-functional PM paradigms, with a specific focus on achieving \emph{full-space communication coverage}, \emph{ubiquitous sensing}, as well as \emph{intelligent signal processing and computing}. i) For simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (STARS)-enabled full-space communications, we elaborate on their operational protocols and pivotal applications in supporting efficient communications, physical layer security, unmanned aerial vehicle networks, and wireless power transfer. ii) For PM-underpinned ubiquitous sensing, we formulate the signal models for the PM-assisted architecture and systematically characterize its advantages in near-field and cooperative sensing, while transitioning to the PM-enabled transceiver architecture and demonstrating its superior performance in multi-band operations. iii) For advanced signal processing and computing, we explore the novel paradigm of stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), investigating their implementation in wave-domain analog processing and over-the-air mathematical computing. Finally, we identify key research challenges and envision future directions for multi-functional PMs towards B6G.

Title: Message Passing Based Demodulation of the Time-Encoded Digital Modulation Signal
Authors: Yuan Xu, Wenhui Xiong
Abstract: This letter proposes a Message Passing (MP) based algorithm for demodulating the time-encoded digital modulation signal. The proposed algorithm processes the spikes generated by the Time-Encoding Machine (TEM) directly on a per-spike basis, which enables "on-the-fly" demodulatio with low latency. The computational complexity of our proposed method scales linearly with the number of demodulated symbols, while the computational complexity of the pseudo-inverse-based method scales cubically with the same number of demodulated symbols.

Title: Symmetry-Based Formation Control on Cycle Graphs Using Dihedral Point Groups
Authors: Zamir Martinez, Daniel Zelazo
Abstract: This work develops a symmetry-based framework for formation control on cycle graphs using Dihedral point-group constraints. We show that enforcing inter-agent reflection symmetries, together with anchoring a single designated agent to its prescribed mirror axis, is sufficient to realize every $\mathcal{C}_{nv}$-symmetric configuration using only $n-1$ communication links. The resulting control laws have a matrix-weighted Laplacian structure and guarantee exponential convergence to the desired symmetric configuration. Furthermore, we extend the method to enable coordinated maneuvers along a time-varying reference trajectory. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical analysis.

Title: Distributed Traffic State Estimation in V2X-Enabled Connected Vehicle Networks
Authors: Vincent de Heij, M. Umar B. Niazi, Saeed Ahmed, Karl Henrik Johansson
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed traffic state estimation framework in which infrastructure sensors and connected vehicles act as autonomous, cooperative sensing nodes. These nodes share local traffic estimates with nearby nodes using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The proposed estimation algorithm uses a distributed Kalman filter tailored to a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. To achieve global state awareness, the algorithm employs a consensus protocol to fuse heterogeneous spatiotemporal estimates from V2X neighbors and applies explicit projection steps to maintain physical consistency in density and flow estimates. The algorithm's performance is validated through microscopic simulations of a highway segment experiencing transient congestion. Results demonstrate that the proposed distributed estimator accurately reconstructs nonlinear shockwave dynamics, even with sparse infrastructure sensors and intermittent vehicular network connectivity. Statistical analysis explores how different connected vehicle penetration rates affect estimation accuracy, revealing notable phase transitions in network observability.

Title: Effective Electromagnetic Degrees of Freedom in Backscatter MIMO Systems
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: While the definition of the effective electromagnetic degrees of freedom (EEMDOFs) of a static linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is well established, the counterpart for a backscatter MIMO (BS-MIMO) system is so far missing. A BS-MIMO system encodes the input information into the loads of backscatter elements. Due to mutual coupling, the mapping from load configuration to observed fields is fundamentally non-linear, which complicates the analysis of BS-EEMDOFs. We introduce a definition of BS-EEMDOFs based on the Jacobian of the observed fields with respect to the load configuration. We derive a closed-form expression from multiport network theory which demonstrates that the number of BS-EEMDOFs is fundamentally a distributed variable, whose distribution depends on the mutual coupling between the backscatter elements and the coherent illumination. The modes associated with BS-EEMDOFs lie in the column space of the end-to-end channel matrix from backscatter array ports to receiver ports, but the number of BS-EEMDOFs is generally different from the number of benchmark EEMDOFs associated with the same array being coherently fed rather than tunably terminated. The dependence on the coherent illumination yields optimized coherent illumination as a control knob for the number of BS-EEMDOFs. We present numerical and experimental results for the evaluation and optimization of the number of BS-EEMDOFs in different radio environments with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

Title: A Physics-Aware Attention LSTM Autoencoder for Early Fault Diagnosis of Battery Systems
Authors: Jiong Yang
Abstract: Battery safety is paramount for electric vehicles. Early fault diagnosis remains a challenge due to the subtle nature of anomalies and the interference of dynamic operating noise. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from "physical blindness" leading to missed detections or false alarms. To address this, we propose a Physics-Aware Attention LSTM Autoencoder (PA-ALSTM-AE). This novel framework explicitly integrates battery aging laws (mileage) into the deep learning pipeline through a multi-stage fusion mechanism. Specifically, an adaptive physical feature construction module selects mileage-sensitive features, and a physics-guided latent fusion module dynamically calibrates the memory cells of the LSTM based on the aging state. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Vloong real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, it improves the recall rate of early faults by over 3 times while maintaining high precision, offering a robust solution for industrial battery management systems.

Title: Bridging Abstraction-Based Hierarchical Control and Moment Matching: A Conceptual Unification
Authors: Zirui Niu, Mohammad Fahim Shakib, Giordano Scarciotti
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between approximate-simulation-based hierarchical control (ASHC) and moment matching techniques, and build a conceptual bridge between these two frameworks. To this end, we study the two key requirements of the ASHC technique, namely the bounded output discrepancy and the $M$-relation, through the lens of moment matching. We show that, in the linear time-invariant case, both requirements can be interpreted in the moment matching perspective through certain system interconnection structures. Building this conceptual bridge provides a foundation for cross-pollination of ideas between these two frameworks.

Title: Bruxism Recognition via Wireless Signal
Authors: Qiankai Shen, Yuanhao Cui, Jie Yang, Xiaojun Jing, Zhiyong Feng, Shi Jin
Abstract: Bruxism is an oromandibular movement disorder involving teeth grinding and clenching, which severely impairs sleep quality and dental health. However, its diagnosis remains challenging, as existing methods often cause discomfort or compromise user privacy. To address these limitations, we establish a contactless bruxism recognition system based on millimeter-wave radar. First, we analyzed the potential impact of the movement patterns of teeth grinding on radar echo signals. Based on this analysis, 11 features were extracted. Subsequently, using these features, we performed classification with a Random Forest model on the dataset constructed via millimeter-wave radar. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 96.1% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score all remaining at a relatively high level. This study validates the effectiveness of millimeter-wave radar for SB recognition, providing a non-invasive and privacy-friendly alternative to existing recognition techniques. Future research will focus on enhancing the robustness of the method across diverse populations and environments, as well as striving to mitigate the interference of other facial micro-movements on teeth grinding recognition.

Title: Joint Learning of Feasibility-Aware Signal Temporal Logic and BarrierNet for Robust and Correct Control
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wenliang Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enforcing safety in optimization-based controllers, and their integration with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has enabled the specification-driven synthesis of complex robotic behaviors. However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and myopic, per-time step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that embeds trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) into a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP). Our approach provides a systematic procedure for constructing time-varying HOCBF constraints for a broad fragment of STL and introduces a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, QP feasibility, and control-bound compliance. Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.

Title: Physics-Guided Diffusion Priors for Multi-Slice Reconstruction in Scientific Imaging
Authors: Laurentius Valdy, Richard D. Paul, Alessio Quercia, Zhuo Cao, Xuan Zhao, Hanno Scharr, Arya Bangun
Abstract: Accurate multi-slice reconstruction from limited measurement data is crucial to speed up the acquisition process in medical and scientific imaging. However, it remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem and the high computational and memory demands. We propose a framework that addresses these challenges by integrating partitioned diffusion priors with physics-based constraints. By doing so, we substantially reduce memory usage per GPU while preserving high reconstruction quality, outperforming both physics-only and full multi-slice reconstruction baselines for different modalities, namely Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM). Additionally, we show that the proposed method improves in-distribution accuracy as well as strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets.

Title: Synergies between AI Computing and Power Systems: Metrics, Scheduling, and Resilience
Authors: Farzaneh Pourahmadi, Olivier Corradi, Pierre Pinson
Abstract: In this paper, we first clarify the concepts of green AI versus frugal AI, positioning frugality as efficiency by design and green AI as transparency and accountability. We then argue that these approaches, while complementary, are insufficient without a shared quantitative foundation that links AI computing to power system contexts. This motivates the development of standardized carbon metrics as a bridge between algorithmic decisions and their physical consequences. We next embed these signals into scheduling and planning frameworks, presenting two architectures: (i) an iterative signal-response loop for real-time operations, and (ii) an integrated optimization that learns and encodes flexible-load behavior for long-term planning. Finally, we show how the same coordination stack supports resilience, enabling signals to shift from emissions-first to stability-first during stress events, providing targeted relief and faster restoration.

Title: Green O-RAN Operation: a Modern ML-Driven Network Energy Consumption Optimisation
Authors: Xuanyu Liang, Ahmed Al-Tahmeesschi, Swarna Chetty, Hamed Ahmadi
Abstract: The increasing energy demand of next-generation mobile networks, especially 6G, is becoming a major concern, particularly due to the high power usage of base station components RU, which often remain active even during low traffic periods. To tackle this challenge, our study focuses on improving energy efficiency in O-RAN systems using intelligent control strategies. TD3 leverages a continuous action space to overcome the limitations of traditional discrete-action methods like DQN. By avoiding exponential growth in action space, TD3 enables more precise control of RU sleep modes in dense and large radio environments. Simulation results show that our approach consistently achieves over 50% energy savings compared to the always-on baseline, with TD3 outperforming DQN-based methods by up to 6%, while also offering better stability and faster convergence.

Title: Random Access for LEO Satellite Communication Systems via Deep Learning
Authors: Hyunwoo Lee, Ian P. Roberts, Jinkyo Jeong, Daesik Hong
Abstract: Integrating contention-based random access procedures into low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems poses new challenges, including long propagation delays, large Doppler shifts, and a large number of simultaneous access attempts. These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes.

Title: Integrated Sensing, Communication, Computing, and Control Meets UAV Swarms in 6G
Authors: Yiyan Ma, Bo Ai, Jingli Li, Weijie Yuan, Boxiang He, Weiyang Feng, Zhengyu Zhang, Qingqing Cheng, Zhangdui Zhong
Abstract: To develop the low-altitude economy, the establishment of the low-altitude wireless network (LAWN) is the first priority. As the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) increases, how to support the reliable flying and effective functioning of UAV swarms is challenging. Recently, the integrated sensing, communication, computing, and control (ISCCC) strategy was designed, which could act as effective physical {\it reflex arc} links in the intelligent LAWN system. Thus, in this article, we outline the challenges and opportunities when ISCCC meets UAV swarm in LAWN in 6G. First, we propose a three-layer ISCCC structure for the UAV swarm, which is categorized according to the UAV swarm's requirements, i.e., flying, self-organizing, and functioning. Second, for different scenarios, we study the basic problem, promising technologies, and challenges to design ISCCC for UAV swarms. Third, through a case study that minimizes the flying trajectory error of the UAV swarm based on the ISCCC principle, we show that ISCCC is promising to simultaneously improve the reliability and efficiency of LAWN via jointly designing four components. Finally, we discuss the promising directions for the ISCCC-based UAV swarm in LAWN.

Title: Momentum-Accelerated Online Feedback Optimization for Power System Flexibility
Authors: Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Matthis Berger, Irina Zettl, Andreas Ulbig
Abstract: Flexibility is increasingly gaining importance in modern power system operation. This paper presents a controller framework based on Online Feedback Optimization for real-time coordination of power system flexibility. The proposed approach introduces a momentum-augmented projection-step to accelerate convergence and improve dynamic performance. We derive the controller formulation, and evaluate its performance and stability in two representative case studies. The first examines online congestion management in distribution feeders, and the second addresses multi-layer flexibility dispatch across system interfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the momentum-based controller achieves faster convergence and maintains constraint satisfaction, highlighting its potential for real-time flexibility control in large-scale power systems.

Title: TagLabel: RFID Based Orientation and Material Sensing for Automated Package Inspection
Authors: David Wang, Jiale Zhang, Pei Zhang
Abstract: Modern logistics systems face increasing difficulty in identifying counterfeit products, fraudulent returns, and hazardous items concealed within packages, yet current package screening methods remain too slow, expensive, and impractical for widespread use. This paper presents TagLabel, an RFID based system that determines both the orientation and contents of packages using low cost passive UHF tags. By analyzing how materials change RSSI and phase, the system identifies the contents of a package without opening it. Using orientation inferred from phase differences, tag occlusion, and antenna gain patterns, the system selects the tag with the greatest occlusion for accurate material sensing. We evaluate two and three tag configurations, and show that both can deliver high orientation and material sensing performance through the use of machine learning classifiers, even in realistic RF environments. When combined into a unified pipeline, TagLabel achieves more than 80 percent accuracy across all package orientations. Because it requires only standard RFID hardware and offers fast scanning times, this approach provides a practical way to enhance package inspection and improve automation in logistics operations.

Title: A Structured Review of Fixed and Multimodal Sensing Techniques for Bat Monitoring
Authors: Maatla Sefawe, Sravya Ganti, Julianna Segalla, Erwei He, Isaac Tourner, Julia Gersey
Abstract: Effective monitoring of mobile animal populations is crucial for ecological research, wildlife management, and agricultural applications. Monitoring of bats specifically can help understand the spread of disease as well as shine light on bat migration patterns, population dynamics, and the impacts of environmental changes on bat colonies. Fixed sensing modalities, such as infrared sensors, cameras, radar, and acoustic detectors, play a pivotal role in tracking and understanding animal behavior. This survey goes over context-informing details about bat biology, and then reviews these fixed sensing modalities, discussing the unique challenges and contributions of each approach. We highlight the coverage, applications, accuracy, and limitations associated with each of these sensing modalities. By synthesizing recent advances, we provide a comprehensive overview to guide future research in this area.

Title: Near Field Electric (NFE): Energy-efficient, High-speed Communication at Decimeter-range
Authors: Samyadip Sarkar, Arunashish Datta, Sihun Kim, Amir Mokhtarpour, Shweta Katakdhond, Shovan Maity, Shreyas Sen
Abstract: Near-field technologies enable contactless payments, building access, automotive keyless entry, and supply chain tracking. Existing approaches face fundamental trade-offs: magnetic-based methods (NFC/NFMI) achieve low power but are limited to sub-megabit rates, while millimeter-wave techniques provide gigabits/sec connectivity at higher power consumption and only centimeter-scale ranges. We demonstrate that near-field electric (NFE) communication breaks this trade-off via capacitive coupling enabled by confined electric fields. NFE simultaneously achieves ultra-low power ($<$1 mW per transceiver), high-speed data throughput ($>$3 Mbps), and configurable decimeter-range (5-30 cm) capabilities previously considered mutually exclusive. Systematic measurements across multiple orientations and configurations show NFE can support decimeter communication coverage. The power consumption of 0.4 mW at the transmitter (Tx) and 0.6 mW at the receiver (Rx), when combined is up to $\sim$24$\times$ lower than NFC and $\sim$3$\times$ lower than NFMI while achieving significantly higher data rates, and a couple of orders of magnitude lower power than mm-wave based technique. Testing with symmetrical electrodes across eight orientations validated consistent performance and robustness for practical deployments. Extended-range experiments achieved stable 2 Mbps throughput at 3.5 meters using conductive media, demonstrating NFE's unique ability to leverage environmental conductors. Optimized device design can facilitate achieving an extended range for Body-assisted NFE up to 1 m. Results establish NFE as foundational for next-generation wireless applications where security, low power, and throughput converge, enabling dense IoT deployments, secure payment systems, and high-speed device-to-device communication previously limited by the power-performance trade-off.

Title: Clinical Interpretability of Deep Learning Segmentation Through Shapley-Derived Agreement and Uncertainty Metrics
Authors: Tianyi Ren, Daniel Low, Pittra Jaengprajak, Juampablo Heras Rivera, Jacob Ruzevick, Mehmet Kurt
Abstract: Segmentation is the identification of anatomical regions of interest, such as organs, tissue, and lesions, serving as a fundamental task in computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models.

Title: Unsupervised Single-Channel Audio Separation with Diffusion Source Priors
Authors: Runwu Shi, Chang Li, Jiang Wang, Rui Zhang, Nabeela Khan, Benjamin Yen, Takeshi Ashizawa, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: Single-channel audio separation aims to separate individual sources from a single-channel mixture. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with synthetically generated paired data. However, obtaining high-quality paired data in real-world scenarios is often difficult. This data scarcity can degrade model performance under unseen conditions and limit generalization ability. To this end, in this work, we approach this problem from an unsupervised perspective, framing it as a probabilistic inverse problem. Our method requires only diffusion priors trained on individual sources. Separation is then achieved by iteratively guiding an initial state toward the solution through reconstruction guidance. Importantly, we introduce an advanced inverse problem solver specifically designed for separation, which mitigates gradient conflicts caused by interference between the diffusion prior and reconstruction guidance during inverse denoising. This design ensures high-quality and balanced separation performance across individual sources. Additionally, we find that initializing the denoising process with an augmented mixture instead of pure Gaussian noise provides an informative starting point that significantly improves the final performance. To further enhance audio prior modeling, we design a novel time-frequency attention-based network architecture that demonstrates strong audio modeling capability. Collectively, these improvements lead to significant performance gains, as validated across speech-sound event, sound event, and speech separation tasks.

Title: Affine Subspace Models and Clustering for Patch-Based Image Denoising
Authors: Tharindu Wickremasinghe, Marco F. Duarte
Abstract: Image tile-based approaches are popular in many image processing applications such as denoising (e.g., non-local means). A key step in their use is grouping the images into clusters, which usually proceeds iteratively splitting the images into clusters and fitting a model for the images in each cluster. Linear subspaces have emerged as a suitable model for tile clusters; however, they are not well matched to images patches given that images are non-negative and thus not distributed around the origin in the tile vector space. We study the use of affine subspace models for the clusters to better match the geometric structure of the image tile vector space. We also present a simple denoising algorithm that relies on the affine subspace clustering model using least squares projection. We review several algorithmic approaches to solve the affine subspace clustering problem and show experimental results that highlight the performance improvements in clustering and denoising.

Title: Non-negative DAG Learning from Time-Series Data
Authors: Samuel Rey, Gonzalo Mateos
Abstract: This work aims to learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures the instantaneous dependencies underlying a multivariate time series. The observed data follow a linear structural vector autoregressive model (SVARM) with both instantaneous and time-lagged dependencies, where the instantaneous structure is modeled by a DAG to reflect potential causal relationships. While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives.

Title: Verifiable Deep Quantitative Group Testing
Authors: Shreyas Jayant Grampurohit, Satish Mulleti, Ajit Rajwade
Abstract: We present a neural network-based framework for solving the quantitative group testing (QGT) problem that achieves both high decoding accuracy and structural verifiability. In QGT, the objective is to identify a small subset of defective items among $N$ candidates using only $M \ll N$ pooled tests, each reporting the number of defectives in the tested subset. We train a multi-layer perceptron to map noisy measurement vectors to binary defect indicators, achieving accurate and robust recovery even under sparse, bounded perturbations. Beyond accuracy, we show that the trained network implicitly learns the underlying pooling structure that links items to tests, allowing this structure to be recovered directly from the network's Jacobian. This indicates that the model does not merely memorize training patterns but internalizes the true combinatorial relationships governing QGT. Our findings reveal that standard feedforward architectures can learn verifiable inverse mappings in structured combinatorial recovery problems.

Title: Cost-Effective XL-MIMO Communication with Cylinder Directly-Connected Antenna Array
Authors: Xuancheng Zhu, Zhiwen Zhou, Zhenjun Dong, Yong Zeng
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, thanks to its superior spatial resolution and beamforming gains. In order to realize XL-MIMO costeffectively, an innovative ray antenna array (RAA) architecture with directly-connected uniform linear array (ULA) was recently proposed, which achieves flexible beamforming without relying on traditional analog phase shifters or digital beamforming. However, RAA suffers from the signal blockage issue since its ray-configured ULAs are placed in the same plane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel antenna array architecture termed cylinder directly-connected antenna array (DCAA), which is achieved via multiple simple uniform circular array (sUCA) with carefully designed orientations in a layered three-dimensional structure. The so-called sUCA partitions the uniform circular array (UCA) into two sub-arrays where each sub-array has all antenna elements directly connected to achieve a desired beam direction corresponding to the sub-array's physical orientation, thus achieving full spatial coverage. Compared with the conventional ULA architecture with hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed cylinder DCAA can achieve uniform spatial resolution, enhanced communication rate and lower hardware costs. Simulation results are provided to validate the promised gains of cylinder DCAA, demonstrating its great potential for high-frequency systems such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) systems.

Title: Off-grid solar energy storage system with hybrid lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lead-acid batteries in high mountains: a case report of Jiujiu Cabins in Taiwan
Authors: Hsien-Ching Chung
Abstract: Mountain huts are buildings located at high altitude, offering a place for hikers and providing shelter. Energy supply on mountain huts is still an open issue. Using renewable energies could be an appropriate solution. Jiujiu Cabins, a famous mountain hut in Shei-Pa National Park, Taiwan, has operated an off-grid solar energy storage system (ESS) with lead-acid batteries. In 2021, a serious system failures took place, leading to no electricity. After an detailed on-site survey, a reorganization and repair project implemented, the energy system came back to operate normally. Meanwhile, a eco-friendly lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP battery) ESS replaces part of the lead-acid battery ESS, forming a hybrid ESS, making a better and green off-grid solar ESS. In this case report, the energy architecture, detailed descriptions, and historical status of the system are provided. An on-site survey of the failed energy system, a system improvement project, and future plan are listed.

Title: An Asynchronous Mixed-Signal Resonate-and-Fire Neuron
Authors: Giuseppe Leo, Paolo Gibertini, Irem Ilter, Erika Covi, Ole Richter, Elisabetta Chicca
Abstract: Analog computing at the edge is an emerging strategy to limit data storage and transmission requirements, as well as energy consumption, and its practical implementation is in its initial stages of development. Translating properties of biological neurons into hardware offers a pathway towards low-power, real-time edge processing. Specifically, resonator neurons offer selectivity to specific frequencies as a potential solution for temporal signal processing. Here, we show a fabricated Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) mixed-signal Resonate-and-Fire (R&F) neuron circuit implementation that emulates the behavior of these neural cells responsible for controlling oscillations within the central nervous system. We integrate the design with asynchronous handshake capabilities, perform comprehensive variability analyses, and characterize its frequency detection functionality. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale integration within neuromorphic systems, thereby advancing the exploitation of bio-inspired circuits for efficient edge temporal signal processing.

Abstract: We study safety-critical control on fully actuated mechanical systems by means of Zeroing Control Barrier Functions (ZCBFs) defined on Lie Groups. Specifically, we introduce and theoretically validate two classes of ZCBFs. The first enforces kinematic constraints, suitable for implementing obstacle avoidance algorithms. The second enforces kinetic energy limits along prescribed inertial-frame translational and rotational directions, relevant for ensuring safe physical interaction. Numerical simulations involving slit traversal and safe landing scenarios are presented to validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed methodology.

Title: From sparse recovery to plug-and-play priors, understanding trade-offs for stable recovery with generalized projected gradient descent
Authors: Ali Joundi (IMB), Yann Traonmilin (IMB), Jean-François Aujol (UB, IMB)
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering an unknown low-dimensional vector from noisy, underdetermined observations. We focus on the Generalized Projected Gradient Descent (GPGD) framework, which unifies traditional sparse recovery methods and modern approaches using learned deep projective priors. We extend previous convergence results to robustness to model and projection errors. We use these theoretical results to explore ways to better control stability and robustness constants. To reduce recovery errors due to measurement noise, we consider generalized back-projection strategies to adapt GPGD to structured noise, such as sparse outliers. To improve the stability of GPGD, we propose a normalized idempotent regularization for the learning of deep projective priors. We provide numerical experiments in the context of sparse recovery and image inverse problems, highlighting the trade-offs between identifiability and stability that can be achieved with such methods.

Title: Impact of RIS Orientation on Throughput in UAV-Assisted Wireless Systems
Authors: Zawar Hussain, Faran Awais Butt, Ali Hussein Muqaibel, Saleh Ahmed Alawsh, Ijaz Haider Naqvi
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) orientation on the throughput performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems. Specifically, we study how physical rotation of the RIS, through controlled azimuth and elevation adjustments, influences the effective channel and data rate. A UAV-mounted RIS enables directional alignment to serve ground users in scenarios where the direct Base Station (BS)-to-user path is blocked. Using the SimRIS channel simulator, we analyze the system under various rotation angles and present performance heatmaps that highlight optimal RIS orientations. The study shows that RIS alignment has a substantial effect on achievable rates, thereby motivating orientation-aware optimization in practical deployments.

Title: Scalable Formal Verification of Incremental Stability in Large-Scale Systems Using Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Ahan Basu, Mahathi Anand, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This work proposes a novel distributed framework for verifying the incremental stability of large-scale systems with unknown dynamics and known interconnection structures using graph neural networks. Our proposed approach relies on the construction of local incremental Lyapunov functions for subsystems, which are then composed together to obtain a suitable Lyapunov function for the interconnected system. Graph neural networks are used to synthesize these functions in a data-driven fashion. The formal correctness guarantee is then obtained by leveraging Lipschitz bounds of the trained neural networks. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is validated through two nonlinear case studies.

Title: Control of Discrete-Time Linear Systems with Charge-Balanced Inputs
Authors: Yuzhen Qin, Zonglin Liu, Marcel van Gerven
Abstract: Electrical brain stimulation relies on externally applied currents to modulate neural activity, but safety constraints require each stimulation cycle to be charge-balanced, enforcing a zero net injected charge. However, how such charge-balanced stimulation works remains poorly understood. This paper investigates the ability of charge-balanced inputs to steer state trajectories in discrete-time linear systems. Motivated by both open-loop and adaptive neurostimulation protocols, we study two practically relevant input structures: periodic (repetitive) charge-balanced inputs and non-repetitive charge-balanced inputs. For each case, we derive novel reachability and controllability conditions. The theoretical results are further validated through numerical demonstrations of minimum-energy control input design.

Title: Dictionary-Based Contrastive Learning for GNSS Jamming Detection
Authors: Zawar Hussain, Arslan Majal, Aamir Hussain Chughtai, Talha Nadeem
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are fundamental in applications across navigation, transportation, and industrial networks. However, their extremely low received power makes them highly vulnerable to radio-frequency interference (RFI) and intentional jamming. Modern data-driven methods offer powerful representational power for such applications, however real-time and reliable jamming detection on resource-limited embedded receivers remains a key challenge due to the high computational and memory demands of the conventional learning paradigm. To address these challenges, this work presents a dictionary-based contrastive learning (DBCL) framework for GNSS jamming detection that integrates transfer learning, contrastive representation learning, and model compression techniques. The framework combines tuned contrastive and dictionary-based loss functions to enhance feature separability under low-data conditions and applies structured pruning and knowledge distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive evaluation across varying data regimes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms modern CNN, MobileViT, and ResNet-18 architectures. The framework achieves a substantial reduction in memory footprint and inference latency, confirming its suitability for real-time, low-power GNSS interference detection on embedded platforms.

Title: Data-Driven Robust Safety Verification for Markov Decision Processes
Authors: Abhijit Mazumdar, Manuela L. Bujorianu, Rafal Wisniewski
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven robust safety verification framework for stochastic dynamical systems modeled as Markov decision processes with time-varying and uncertain transition probabilities. Rather than assuming access to the exact nominal transition kernel, we consider the realistic setting where only samples from multiple system executions are available. These samples may correspond to different transition models inside an ambiguity set around the nominal transition kernel. Using these observations, we construct a unified ambiguity set that captures both inherent run-to-run variability in the transition dynamics and finite-sample statistical uncertainty. This ambiguity set is formalized through a Wasserstein-distance ball around a nominal empirical distribution and naturally induces an interval Markov decision process representation of the underlying system. Within this representation, we introduce a robust safety function that characterizes reach-avoid type probabilistic safety under all transition kernels consistent with the interval Markov decision process. We further derive high-confidence safety guarantees for the true, unknown time-varying system. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Precise Liver Tumor Segmentation in CT Using a Hybrid Deep Learning-Radiomics Framework
Authors: Xuecheng Li, Weikuan Jia, Komildzhon Sharipov, Alimov Ruslan, Lutfuloev Mazbutdzhon, Ismoilov Shuhratjon, Yuanjie Zheng
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional delineation of liver tumors on contrast-enhanced CT is a prerequisite for treatment planning, navigation and response assessment, yet manual contouring is slow, observer-dependent and difficult to standardise across centres. Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing.

Title: R2MF-Net: A Recurrent Residual Multi-Path Fusion Network for Robust Multi-directional Spine X-ray Segmentation
Authors: Xuecheng Li, Weikuan Jia, Komildzhon Sharipov, Sharipov Hotam Beknazarovich, Farzona S. Ataeva, Qurbonaliev Alisher, Yuanjie Zheng
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of spinal structures in X-ray images is a prerequisite for quantitative scoliosis assessment, including Cobb angle measurement, vertebral translation estimation and curvature classification. In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations.

Title: Optimal Pulse Patterns through a Hybrid Optimal Control Perspective
Authors: Jared Miller, Petros Karamanakos
Abstract: Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation method in which the switching angles and levels of a switching signal are computed via an offline optimization procedure to minimize a performance metric, typically the harmonic distortions of the load current. Additional constraints can be incorporated into the optimization problem to achieve secondary objectives, such as the limitation of specific harmonics or the reduction of power converter losses. The resulting optimization problem, however, is highly nonconvex, featuring a trigonometric objective function and constraints as well as both real- and integer-valued optimization variables. This work casts the task of OPP synthesis for a multilevel converter as an optimal control problem of a hybrid system. This problem is in turn lifted into a convex but infinite-dimensional conic program of occupation measures using established methods in convex relaxations of optimal control. Lower bounds on the minimum achievable harmonic distortion are acquired by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs via the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy, where each semidefinite program scales in a jointly linear manner with the numbers of permitted switching transitions and converter voltage levels.

Title: Obstacle Avoidance of UAV in Dynamic Environments Using Direction and Velocity-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field
Authors: Nikita Vaibhav Pavle, Shrreya Rajneesh, Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Manoranjan Sinha
Abstract: The conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) is fundamentally limited by the local minima issue and its inability to account for the kinematics of moving obstacles. This paper addresses the critical challenge of autonomous collision avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic and cluttered airspace by proposing a novel Direction and Relative Velocity Weighted Artificial Potential Field (APF). In this approach, a bounded weighting function, $\omega(\theta,v_{e})$, is introduced to dynamically scale the repulsive potential based on the direction and velocity of the obstacle relative to the UAV. This robust APF formulation is integrated within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate collision-free trajectories while adhering to kinematic constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves local minima and significantly enhances safety by enabling smooth, predictive avoidance maneuvers. The system ensures superior path integrity and reliable performance, confirming its viability for autonomous navigation in complex environments.

Title: Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching-Antenna Systems (SWANs) for ISAC
Authors: Hao Jiang, Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan, Zhiguo Ding, Robert Schober
Abstract: A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN)-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed. Unlike conventional pinching antenna systems (PASS), which use a single long waveguide, SWAN divides the waveguide into multiple short segments, each with a dedicated feed point. Thanks to the segmented structure, SWAN enhances sensing performance by significantly simplifying the reception model and reducing the in-waveguide propagation loss. To balance performance and complexity, three segment controlling protocols are proposed for the transceivers, namely i) \emph{segment selection} to select a single segment for signal transceiving, ii) \emph{segment aggregation} to aggregate signals from all segments using a single RF chain, and iii) \emph{segment multiplexing} to jointly process the signals from all segments using individual RF chains. The theoretical sensing performance limit is first analyzed for different protocols, unveiling how the sensing performance gain of SWAN scales with the number of segments. Based on this performance limit, the Pareto fronts of sensing and communication performance are characterized for the simple one-user one-target case, which is then extended to the general multi-user single-target case based on time-division multiple access (TDMA). Numerical results are presented to verify the correctness of the derivations and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which jointly confirm the advantages of SWAN-assisted ISAC.

Title: Linear Quadratic Control with Non-Markovian and Non-Semimartingale Noise Models
Authors: Mostafa M. Shibl, Sharan Srinivasan, Harsha Honnappa, Vijay Gupta
Abstract: The standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework assumes a Brownian noise process and relies on classical stochastic calculus tools, such as those based on Itô calculus. In this paper, we solve a generalized linear quadratic optimal control problem where the process and measurement noises can be non-Markovian and non-semimartingale stochastic processes with sample paths that have low Hölder regularity. Since these noise models do not, in general, permit the use of the standard Itô calculus, we employ rough path theory to formulate and solve the problem. By leveraging signature representations and controlled rough paths, we derive the optimal state estimation and control strategies.

Title: Research on a Monitoring System for High-Voltage Cables in a Coal Mine Based on Intelligent Sensing Technology
Authors: Z Gao, J Li, L Tao, B Meng
Abstract: Given the importance of monitoring the operational status of high-voltage cables in coal mines, this study investigates the application of intelligent sensing technology to the online monitoring of such cables. Taking an actual coal mine as a case study, a three-layer architecture high-voltage cable monitoring system was designed. The system employs high-frequency current sensors and distributed optical fiber temperature sensors to achieve real-time acquisition of partial discharge signals and temperature distribution data. Data analysis and fault diagnosis are performed through a combined approach of edge computing and cloud computing. The research results demonstrate that the system can accurately identify cable insulation defects and potential overheating hazards, with a diagnostic accuracy exceeding 95%, thereby significantly enhancing the reliability of power supply in mines.

Title: The explicit game-theoretic linear quadratic regulator for constrained multi-agent systems
Authors: Emilio Benenati, Giuseppe Belgioioso
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm to compute the explicit open-loop solution to both finite and infinite-horizon dynamic games subject to state and input constraints. Our approach relies on a multiparametric affine variational inequality characterization of the open-loop Nash equilibria and extends the classical explicit constrained LQR and MPC frameworks to multi-agent non-cooperative settings. A key practical implication is that linear-quadratic game-theoretic MPC becomes viable even at very high sampling rates for multi-agent systems of moderate size. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvements in online computation time and solution accuracy compared with state-of-the-art game-theoretic solvers.

Title: Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Power System Identification
Authors: Hannes M. H. Wolf, Christian A. Hans
Abstract: Due the complexity of modern power systems, modeling based on first-order principles becomes increasingly difficult. As an alternative, dynamical models for simulation and control design can be obtained by black-box identification techniques. One such technique for the identification of continuous-time systems are neural ordinary differential equations. For training and inference, they require initial values of system states, such as phase angles and frequencies. While frequencies can typically be measured, phase angle measurements are usually not available. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel structure based on augmented neural ordinary differential equations, learning latent phase angle representations on historic observations with temporal convolutional networks. Our approach combines state-of-the art deep learning techniques, avoiding the necessity of phase angle information for the power system identification. Results show, that our approach clearly outperforms simpler augmentation techniques.

Title: FishDetector-R1: Unified MLLM-Based Framework with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Weakly Supervised Fish Detection, Segmentation, and Counting
Authors: Yi Liu, Jingyu Song, Vedanth Kallakuri, Katherine A. Skinner
Abstract: Analyzing underwater fish imagery is critical for ecological monitoring but remains difficult due to visual degradation and costly annotations. We introduce FishDetector-R1, a unified MLLM-based framework for fish detection, segmentation, and counting under weak supervision. On the DeepFish dataset, our framework achieves substantial gains over baselines, improving AP by 20% and mIoU by 10%, while reducing MAE by 30% and GAME by 35%. These improvements stem from two key components: a novel detect-to-count prompt that enforces spatially consistent detections and counts, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) with a complementary scalable paradigm leveraging sparse point labels. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of this reward design. Moreover, the improvement generalizes well to other underwater datasets, confirming strong cross-domain robustness. Overall, FishDetector-R1 provides a reliable and scalable solution for accurate marine visual understanding via weak supervision. The project page for FishDetector-R1 is this https URL.

Title: Training-Free Robot Pose Estimation using Off-the-Shelf Foundational Models
Authors: Laurence Liang
Abstract: Pose estimation of a robot arm from visual inputs is a challenging task. However, with the increasing adoption of robot arms for both industrial and residential use cases, reliable joint angle estimation can offer improved safety and performance guarantees, and also be used as a verifier to further train robot policies. This paper introduces using frontier vision-language models (VLMs) as an ``off-the-shelf" tool to estimate a robot arm's joint angles from a single target image. By evaluating frontier VLMs on both synthetic and real-world image-data pairs, this paper establishes a performance baseline attained by current FLMs. In addition, this paper presents empirical results suggesting that test time scaling or parameter scaling alone does not lead to improved joint angle predictions.

Title: Physics-Guided Deepfake Detection for Voice Authentication Systems
Authors: Alireza Mohammadi, Keshav Sood, Dhananjay Thiruvady, Asef Nazari
Abstract: Voice authentication systems deployed at the network edge face dual threats: a) sophisticated deepfake synthesis attacks and b) control-plane poisoning in distributed federated learning protocols. We present a framework coupling physics-guided deepfake detection with uncertainty-aware in edge learning. The framework fuses interpretable physics features modeling vocal tract dynamics with representations coming from a self-supervised learning module. The representations are then processed via a Multi-Modal Ensemble Architecture, followed by a Bayesian ensemble providing uncertainty estimates. Incorporating physics-based characteristics evaluations and uncertainty estimates of audio samples allows our proposed framework to remain robust to both advanced deepfake attacks and sophisticated control-plane poisoning, addressing the complete threat model for networked voice authentication.

Title: Unifying Entropy Regularization in Optimal Control: From and Back to Classical Objectives via Iterated Soft Policies and Path Integral Solutions
Authors: Ajinkya Bhole, Mohammad Mahmoudi Filabadi, Guillaume Crevecoeur, Tom Lefebvre
Abstract: This paper develops a unified perspective on several stochastic optimal control formulations through the lens of Kullback-Leibler regularization. We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems.

Title: Probabilistic Weapon Engagement Zones for a Turn Constrained Pursuer
Authors: Grant Stagg, Isaac E. Weintraub, Cameron K. Peterson
Abstract: Curve-straight probabilistic engagement zones (CSPEZ) quantify the spatial regions an evader should avoid to reduce capture risk from a turn-rate-limited pursuer following a curve-straight path with uncertain parameters including position, heading, velocity, range, and maximum turn rate. This paper presents methods for generating evader trajectories that minimize capture risk under such uncertainty. We first derive an analytic solution for the deterministic curve-straight basic engagement zone (CSBEZ), then extend this formulation to a probabilistic framework using four uncertainty-propagation approaches: Monte Carlo sampling, linearization, quadratic approximation, and neural-network regression. We evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of each approximation method and demonstrate how CSPEZ constraints can be integrated into a trajectory-optimization algorithm to produce safe paths that explicitly account for pursuer uncertainty.

Title: Real-Time Spatiotemporal Tubes for Dynamic Unsafe Sets
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Siddhartha Upadhyay, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper presents a real-time control framework for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy reach-avoid-stay tasks within a prescribed time in dynamic environments. To achieve this, we introduce a real-time spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework. An STT is defined as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius adapt online using only real-time sensory input. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is then derived to constrain the system output within the STT, ensuring safety and task satisfaction. We provide formal guarantees for obstacle avoidance and on-time task completion. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulations and hardware experiments on a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle, navigating in cluttered dynamic environments.

Title: Situation-Aware Interactive MPC Switching for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Shuhao Qi, Qiling Aori, Luyao Zhang, Mircea Lazar, Sofie Haesaert
Abstract: To enable autonomous driving in interactive traffic scenarios, various model predictive control (MPC) formulations have been proposed, each employing different interaction models. While higher-fidelity models enable more intelligent behavior, they incur increased computational cost. Since strong interactions are relatively infrequent in traffic, a practical strategy for balancing performance and computational overhead is to invoke an appropriate controller based on situational demands. To achieve this approach, we first conduct a comparative study to assess and hierarchize the interactive capabilities of different MPC formulations. Furthermore, we develop a neural network-based classifier to enable situation-aware switching among controllers with different levels of interactive capability. We demonstrate that this situation-aware switching can both substantially improve overall performance by activating the most advanced interactive MPC in rare but critical situations, and significantly reduce computational load by using a basic MPC in the majority of scenarios.

Title: Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Prediction of Color Trajectories in Food Drying
Authors: Shichen Li, Ahmadreza Eslaminia, Chenhui Shao
Abstract: Food drying is widely used to reduce moisture content, ensure safety, and extend shelf life. Color evolution of food samples is an important indicator of product quality in food drying. Although existing studies have examined color changes under different drying conditions, current approaches primarily rely on low-dimensional color features and cannot fully capture the complex, dynamic color trajectories of food samples. Moreover, existing modeling approaches lack the ability to generalize to unseen process conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel multi-modal color-trajectory prediction method that integrates high-dimensional temporal color information with drying process parameters to enable accurate and data-efficient color trajectory prediction. Under unseen drying conditions, the model attains RMSEs of 2.12 for cookie drying and 1.29 for apple drying, reducing errors by over 90% compared with baseline models. These experimental results demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, robustness, and broad applicability.

Title: Defending Event-Triggered Systems against Out-of-Envelope Environments
Authors: Marcus Völp, Mohammad Ibrahim Alkoudsi, Azin Bayrami Asl, Kristin Krüger, Julio Rodrigues Mendonca da Neto, Gerhard Fohler
Abstract: The design of real-time systems is based on assumptions about environmental conditions in which they will operate. We call this their safe operational envelope. Violation of these assumptions, i.e., out-of-envelope environments, can jeopardize timeliness and safety of real-time systems, e.g., by overwhelming them with interrupt storms. A long-lasting debate has been going on over which design paradigm, the time- or event-triggered, is more robust against such behavior. In this work, we investigate the claim that time-triggered systems are immune against out-of-envelope behavior and how event-triggered systems can be constructed to defend against being overwhelmed by interrupt showers. We introduce importance (independently of priority and criticality) as a means to express which tasks should still be scheduled in case environmental design assumptions cease to hold, draw parallels to mixed-criticality scheduling, and demonstrate how event-triggered systems can defend against out-of-envelope behavior.

Title: Stabilizing Rate of Stochastic Control Systems with Multiplicative Noise
Authors: Hui Jia, Yuan-Hua Ni, Guangchen Wang
Abstract: This paper develops a quantitative framework for analyzing the mean-square exponential stabilization of stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise, focusing specifically on the optimal stabilizing rate, which characterizes the fastest exponential stabilization achievable under admissible control policies.  Our contributions are twofold. First, we extend norm-based techniques from deterministic switched systems to the stochastic setting, deriving a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the exact attainability of the optimal stabilizing rate, together with computable upper and lower bounds. Second, by restricting attention to state-feedback policies, we reformulate the optimal stabilizing rate problem as an optimal control problem with a nonlinear cost function and derive a Bellman-type equation. Since this Bellman-type equation is not directly tractable, we recast it as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem whose valid solutions require strictly positive-definite matrices. To ensure the existence of such solutions, we introduce a regularization scheme and develop a Regularized Normalized Value Iteration (RNVI) algorithm, which in turn generates strictly positive-definite fixed points for a perturbed version of original nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem while producing feedback controllers. Evaluating these regularized solutions further yields certified lower and upper bounds for the optimal stabilizing rate, resulting in a constructive and verifiable framework for determining the fastest achievable mean-square stabilization under multiplicative noise.

Title: The Missing Variable: Socio-Technical Alignment in Risk Evaluation
Authors: Niclas Flehmig, Mary Ann Lundteigen, Shen Yin
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in the risk assessment of AI-enabled safety-critical systems. While these systems, where AI systems assists human operators, function as complex socio-technical systems, existing risk evaluation methods fail to account for the associated complex interaction between human, technical, and organizational elements. Through a comparative analysis of system attributes from both socio-technical and AI-enabled systems and a review of current risk evaluation methods, we confirm the absence of socio-technical considerations in standard risk expressions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel socio-technical alignment $STA$ variable designed to be integrated into the foundational risk equation. This variable estimates the degree of harmonious interaction between the AI systems, human operators, and organizational processes. A case study on an AI-enabled liquid hydrogen bunkering system demonstrates the variable's relevance. By comparing a naive and a safeguarded system design, we illustrate how the $STA$-augmented expression captures socio-technical safety implications that traditional risk evaluation overlooks, providing a more holistic basis for risk evaluation.

Title: Demographic Dependence of Vaccine Adoption under Opinion Persuasion
Authors: Alessandro Casu, Camilla Quaresmini, Robin Delabays, Lewis Mitchell, Philip E. Paré
Abstract: Inspired by contagion models of social belief formation, we develop an epistemically-informed modeling framework, SIS-Vo, in which vaccine-related information propagates on a signed opinion network. Our model allows for heterogeneous treatment effects of policy messages across subpopulations through demographic-specific responses. We derive fixed-point characterizations of the healthy (disease-free) and endemic equilibria of this model, and obtain conditions for local stability of the healthy state in terms of the contact network and opinion-dependent vaccination capacities. Using numerical simulations, we illustrate how suitably targeted policy interventions, acting through opinion dynamics, can stabilize the epidemic process by moving the system towards the healthy regime. The SIS-Vo framework thus provides a natural basis for control-theoretic analysis of vaccination policies that remain robust even when misinformation targets specific subgroups.

Title: Leveraging Port-Hamiltonian Theory for Impedance Control Benchmarking
Authors: Leonardo F. Dos Santos, Elisa G. Vergamini, Cícero Zanette, Lucca Maitan, Thiago Boaventura
Abstract: This work proposes PH-based metrics for benchmarking impedance control. A causality-consistent PH model is introduced for mass-spring-damper impedance in Cartesian space. Based on this model, a differentiable, force-torque sensing-independent, n-DoF passivity condition is derived, valid for time-varying references. An impedance fidelity metric is also defined from step-response power in free motion, capturing dynamic decoupling. The proposed metrics are validated in Gazebo simulations with a six-DoF manipulator and a quadruped leg. Results demonstrate the suitability of the PH framework for standardized impedance control benchmarking.

Title: BitStopper: An Efficient Transformer Attention Accelerator via Stage-fusion and Early Termination
Authors: Huizheng Wang, Hongbin Wang, Shaojun Wei, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin
Abstract: Attention-based large language models (LLMs) have transformed modern AI applications, but the quadratic cost of self-attention imposes significant compute and memory overhead. Dynamic sparsity (DS) attention mitigates this, yet its hardware efficiency is limited by the added prediction stage and the heavy memory traffic it entails. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BitStopper, a fine-grained algorithm-architecture co-design that operates without a sparsity predictor. First, a bit-serial enable stage fusion (BESF) mechanism is proposed to reuse and minimize the memory access by progressively terminating trivial tokens and merging the prediction stage into the execution stage. Second, a lightweight and adaptive token selection (LATS) strategy is developed to work in concert with the bit-level sparsity speculation. Third, a bit-level asynchronous processing (BAP) strategy is employed to improve compute utilization during the on-demand bit-grained memory fetching. Finally, an elaborate architecture is designed to translate the theoretical complexity reduction into practical performance improvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer accelerators, BitStopper achieves 2.03x and 1.89x speedups over Sanger and SOFA, respectively, while delivering 2.4x and 2.1x improvements in energy efficiency.

Title: Switched Linear Ensemble Systems and Structural Controllability
Authors: Haoyu Yin, Yi Li, Ouyang Du, Bruno Sinopoli, Xudong Chen
Abstract: This paper introduces and solves a structural controllability problem for ensembles of switched linear systems. All individual subsystems in the ensemble are sparse, governed by the same sparsity pattern, and undergo switching at the same sequence of time instants. The controllability of an ensemble system describes the ability to use a common control input to simultaneously steer every individual system. A sparsity pattern is called structurally controllable for pair \((k,q)\) if it admits a controllable ensemble of \(q\) individual systems with at most \(k\) switches. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a sparsity pattern to be structurally controllable for a given \((k,q)\), and characterize when a sparsity pattern admits a finite \(k\) that guarantees structural controllability for \((k,q)\) for arbitrary $q$. Compared with the linear time-invariant ensemble case, this second condition is strictly weaker. We further show that these conditions have natural connections with maximum flow, and hence can be checked by polynomial algorithms. Specifically, the time complexity of deciding structural controllability is \(O(n^3)\) and the complexity of computing the smallest number of switches needed is \(O(n^3 \log n)\), with \(n\) the dimension of each individual subsystem.

Title: Lightweight Wasserstein Audio-Visual Model for Unified Speech Enhancement and Separation
Authors: Jisoo Park, Seonghak Lee, Guisik Kim, Taewoo Kim, Junseok Kwon
Abstract: Speech Enhancement (SE) and Speech Separation (SS) have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks in speech processing. However, real-world audio often involves both background noise and overlapping speakers, motivating the need for a unified solution. While recent approaches have attempted to integrate SE and SS within multi-stage architectures, these approaches typically involve complex, parameter-heavy models and rely on supervised training, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose UniVoiceLite, a lightweight and unsupervised audio-visual framework that unifies SE and SS within a single model. UniVoiceLite leverages lip motion and facial identity cues to guide speech extraction and employs Wasserstein distance regularization to stabilize the latent space without requiring paired noisy-clean data. Experimental results demonstrate that UniVoiceLite achieves strong performance in both noisy and multi-speaker scenarios, combining efficiency with robust generalization.

Title: Decoding Motor Behavior Using Deep Learning and Reservoir Computing
Authors: Tian Lan
Abstract: We present a novel approach to EEG decoding for non-invasive brain machine interfaces (BMIs), with a focus on motor-behavior classification. While conventional convolutional architectures such as EEGNet and DeepConvNet are effective in capturing local spatial patterns, they are markedly less suited for modeling long-range temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. To address this limitation, we integrate an Echo State Network (ESN), a prominent paradigm in reservoir computing into the decoding pipeline. ESNs construct a high-dimensional, sparsely connected recurrent reservoir that excels at tracking temporal dynamics, thereby complementing the spatial representational power of CNNs. Evaluated on a skateboard-trick EEG dataset preprocessed via the PREP pipeline and implemented in MNE-Python, our ESNNet achieves 83.2% within-subject and 51.3% LOSO accuracies, surpassing widely used CNN-based baselines.

Title: Model-Less Feedback Control of Space-based Continuum Manipulators using Backbone Tension Optimization
Authors: Shrreya Rajneesh, Nikita Pavle, Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Manoranjan Sinha
Abstract: Continuum manipulators offer intrinsic dexterity and safe geometric compliance for navigation within confined and obstacle-rich environments. However, their infinite-dimensional backbone deformation, unmodeled internal friction, and configuration-dependent stiffness fundamentally limit the reliability of model-based kinematic formulations, resulting in inaccurate Jacobian predictions, artificial singularities, and unstable actuation behavior. Motivated by these limitations, this work presents a complete model-less control framework that bypasses kinematic modeling by using an empirically initialized Jacobian refined online through differential convex updates. Tip motion is generated via a real-time quadratic program that computes actuator increments while enforcing tendon slack avoidance and geometric limits. A backbone tension optimization term is introduced in this paper to regulate axial loading and suppress co-activation compression. The framework is validated across circular, pentagonal, and square trajectories, demonstrating smooth convergence, stable tension evolution, and sub-millimeter steady-state accuracy without any model calibration or parameter identification. These results establish the proposed controller as a scalable alternative to model-dependent continuum manipulation in a constrained environment.

Title: Control of Powered Ankle-Foot Prostheses on Compliant Terrain: A Quantitative Approach to Stability Enhancement
Authors: Chrysostomos Karakasis, Camryn Scully, Robert Salati, Panagiotis Artemiadis
Abstract: Walking on compliant terrain presents a substantial challenge for individuals with lower-limb amputation, further elevating their already high risk of falling. While powered ankle-foot prostheses have demonstrated adaptability across speeds and rigid terrains, control strategies optimized for soft or compliant surfaces remain underexplored. This work experimentally validates an admittance-based control strategy that dynamically adjusts the quasi-stiffness of powered prostheses to enhance gait stability on compliant ground. Human subject experiments were conducted with three healthy individuals walking on two bilaterally compliant surfaces with ground stiffness values of 63 and 25 kN/m, representative of real-world soft environments. Controller performance was quantified using phase portraits and two walking stability metrics, offering a direct assessment of fall risk. Compared to a standard phase-variable controller developed for rigid terrain, the proposed admittance controller consistently improved gait stability across all compliant conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, stability-aware prosthesis control to reduce fall risk in real-world environments and advance the robustness of human-prosthesis interaction in rehabilitation robotics.

Title: Learning Conditional Independence Differential Graphs From Time-Dependent Data
Authors: Jitendra K Tugnait
Abstract: Estimation of differences in conditional independence graphs (CIGs) of two time series Gaussian graphical models (TSGGMs) is investigated where the two TSGGMs are known to have similar structure. The TSGGM structure is encoded in the inverse power spectral density (IPSD) of the time series. In several existing works, one is interested in estimating the difference in two precision matrices to characterize underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of data consisting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations. In this paper we consider estimation of the difference in two IPSDs to characterize the underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of time-dependent data. Our approach accounts for data time dependencies unlike past work. We analyze a penalized D-trace loss function approach in the frequency domain for differential graph learning, using Wirtinger calculus. We consider both convex (group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented to optimize the objective function. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm) and graph recovery. Both synthetic and real data examples are presented in support of the proposed approaches. In synthetic data examples, our log-sum-penalized differential time-series graph estimator significantly outperformed our lasso based differential time-series graph estimator which, in turn, significantly outperformed an existing lasso-penalized i.i.d. modeling approach, with $F_1$ score as the performance metric.

Title: LLM-Driven Composite Neural Architecture Search for Multi-Source RL State Encoding
Authors: Yu Yu, Qian Xie, Nairen Cao, Li Jin
Abstract: Designing state encoders for reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple information sources -- such as sensor measurements, time-series signals, image observations, and textual instructions -- remains underexplored and often requires manual design. We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline that leverages language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework.

Title: Utilizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Encoder-Decoder Architecture Agents to Identify Optimal Resection Location in Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients
Authors: Krishna Arun, Moinak Bhattachrya, Paras Goel
Abstract: Currently, there is a noticeable lack of AI in the medical field to support doctors in treating heterogenous brain tumors such as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the deadliest human cancer in the world with a five-year survival rate of just 5.1%. This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%. These results project to increase survival rates by 0.9%, potentially saving approximately 2,250 lives.

Title: Surrogate compliance modeling enables reinforcement learned locomotion gaits for soft robots
Authors: Jue Wang, Mingsong Jiang, Luis A.Ramirez, Bilige Yang, Mujun Zhang, Esteban Figueroa, Wenzhong Yan, Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio
Abstract: Adaptive morphogenetic robots adapt their morphology and control policies to meet changing tasks and environmental conditions. Many such systems leverage soft components, which enable shape morphing but also introduce simulation and control challenges. Soft-body simulators remain limited in accuracy and computational tractability, while rigid-body simulators cannot capture soft-material dynamics. Here, we present a surrogate compliance modeling approach: rather than explicitly modeling soft-body physics, we introduce indirect variables representing soft-material deformation within a rigid-body simulator. We validate this approach using our amphibious robotic turtle, a quadruped with soft morphing limbs designed for multi-environment locomotion. By capturing deformation effects as changes in effective limb length and limb center of mass, and by applying reinforcement learning with extensive randomization of these indirect variables, we achieve reliable policy learning entirely in a rigid-body simulation. The resulting gaits transfer directly to hardware, demonstrating high-fidelity sim-to-real performance on hard, flat substrates and robust, though lower-fidelity, transfer on rheologically complex terrains. The learned closed-loop gaits exhibit unprecedented terrestrial maneuverability and achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost of transport compared to open-loop baselines. Field experiments with the robot further demonstrate stable, multi-gait locomotion across diverse natural terrains, including gravel, grass, and mud.

Title: JEPA as a Neural Tokenizer: Learning Robust Speech Representations with Density Adaptive Attention
Authors: Georgios Ioannides, Christos Constantinou, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins, Linsey Pang, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Yann LeCun
Abstract: We introduce a two-stage self-supervised framework that combines the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with a Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) for learning robust speech representations. Stage~1 uses JEPA with DAAM to learn semantic audio features via masked prediction in latent space, fully decoupled from waveform reconstruction. Stage~2 leverages these representations for efficient tokenization using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a mixed-radix packing scheme, followed by high-fidelity waveform reconstruction with a HiFi-GAN decoder. By integrating Gaussian mixture-based density-adaptive gating into the JEPA encoder, the model performs adaptive temporal feature selection and discovers hierarchical speech structure at a low frame rate of 2.5~Hz. The resulting tokens (47.5 tokens/sec) provide a reversible, highly compressed, and language-model-friendly representation that is competitive with, and often more efficient than, existing neural audio codecs.

Title: Characterizing Lane-Changing Behavior in Mixed Traffic
Authors: Sungyong Chung, Alireza Talebpour, Samer H. Hamdar
Abstract: Characterizing and understanding lane-changing behavior in the presence of automated vehicles (AVs) is crucial to ensuring safety and efficiency in mixed traffic. Accordingly, this study aims to characterize the interactions between the lane-changing vehicle (active vehicle) and the vehicle directly impacted by the maneuver in the target lane (passive vehicle). Utilizing real-world trajectory data from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), this study explores patterns in lane-changing behavior and provides insight into how these behaviors evolve under different AV market penetration rates (MPRs). In particular, we propose a game-theoretic framework to analyze cooperative and defective behaviors in mixed traffic, applied to the 7,636 observed lane-changing events in the WOMD. First, we utilize k-means clustering to classify vehicles as cooperative or defective, revealing that the proportions of cooperative AVs are higher than those of HDVs in both active and passive roles. Next, we jointly estimate the utilities of active and passive vehicles to model their behaviors using the quantal response equilibrium framework. Empirical payoff tables are then constructed based on these utilities. Using these payoffs, we analyze the presence of social dilemmas and examine the evolution of cooperative behaviors using evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal the presence of social dilemmas in approximately 4% and 11% of lane-changing events for active and passive vehicles, respectively, with most classified as Stag Hunt or Prisoner's Dilemma (Chicken Game rarely observed). Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation results show that repeated lane-changing interactions consistently lead to increased cooperative behavior over time, regardless of the AV penetration rate.

Title: TeluguST-46: A Benchmark Corpus and Comprehensive Evaluation for Telugu-English Speech Translation
Authors: Bhavana Akkiraju, Srihari Bandarupalli, Swathi Sambangi, Vasavi Ravuri, R Vijaya Saraswathi, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Despite Telugu being spoken by over 80 million people, speech translation research for this morphologically rich language remains severely underexplored. We address this gap by developing a high-quality Telugu--English speech translation benchmark from 46 hours of manually verified CSTD corpus data (30h/8h/8h train/dev/test split). Our systematic comparison of cascaded versus end-to-end architectures shows that while IndicWhisper + IndicMT achieves the highest performance due to extensive Telugu-specific training data, finetuned SeamlessM4T models demonstrate remarkable competitiveness despite using significantly less Telugu-specific training data. This finding suggests that with careful hyperparameter tuning and sufficient parallel data (potentially less than 100 hours), end-to-end systems can achieve performance comparable to cascaded approaches in low-resource settings. Our metric reliability study evaluating BLEU, METEOR, ChrF++, ROUGE-L, TER, and BERTScore against human judgments reveals that traditional metrics provide better quality discrimination than BERTScore for Telugu--English translation. The work delivers three key contributions: a reproducible Telugu--English benchmark, empirical evidence of competitive end-to-end performance potential in low-resource scenarios, and practical guidance for automatic evaluation in morphologically complex language pairs.

Title: SINRL: Socially Integrated Navigation with Reinforcement Learning using Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Florian Tretter, Daniel Flögel, Alexandru Vasilache, Max Grobbel, Jürgen Becker, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: Integrating autonomous mobile robots into human environments requires human-like decision-making and energy-efficient, event-based computation. Despite progress, neuromorphic methods are rarely applied to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) navigation approaches due to unstable training. We address this gap with a hybrid socially integrated DRL actor-critic approach that combines Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in the actor with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the critic and a neuromorphic feature extractor to capture temporal crowd dynamics and human-robot interactions. Our approach enhances social navigation performance and reduces estimated energy consumption by approximately 1.69 orders of magnitude.

Title: Efficient ASR for Low-Resource Languages: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Unlabeled Data
Authors: Srihari Bandarupalli, Bhavana Akkiraju, Charan Devarakonda, Vamsiraghusimha Narsinga, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and computational resources required by state-of-the-art models. We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios. This work provides a practical pathway toward inclusive speech technology, enabling effective ASR for underrepresented languages without dependence on massive computational infrastructure or proprietary datasets.

Title: Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Docking Between Autonomous Surface Vehicles with Disturbance Rejection
Authors: Gianpietro Battocletti, Dimitris Boskos, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) are a popular and efficient type of marine craft that find application in a large number of water-based tasks. When multiple USVs operate in the same area, they may be required to dock to each other to perform a shared task. Existing approaches for the docking between autonomous USVs generally consider one USV as a stationary target, while the second one is tasked to reach the required docking pose. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach for USV-USV docking, where two USVs work together to dock at an agreed location. We use a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to solve the control problem, obtaining feasible trajectories that also guarantee constraint satisfaction. Owing to its model-based nature, this approach allows the rejection of disturbances, inclusive of exogenous inputs, by anticipating their effect on the USVs through the MPC prediction model. This is particularly effective in case of almost-stationary disturbances such as water currents. In simulations, we demonstrate how the proposed approach allows for a faster and more efficient docking with respect to existing approaches.

Title: Orbit recovery under the rigid motions group
Authors: Amnon Balanov, Tamir Bendory, Dan Edidin
Abstract: We study the orbit recovery problem under the rigid-motion group SE(n), where the objective is to reconstruct an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations subjected to unknown rotations and translations. This problem is fundamental in signal processing, computer vision, and structural biology. Our main theoretical contribution is bounding the sample complexity of this problem. We show that if the d-th order moment under the rotation group SO(n) uniquely determines the signal orbit, then orbit recovery under SE(n) is achievable with $N\gtrsim \sigma^{2d+4}$ samples as the noise variance $\sigma^2 \to \infty$. The key technical insight is that the d-th order SO(n) moments can be explicitly recovered from (d+2)-order SE(n) autocorrelations, enabling us to transfer known results from the rotation-only setting to the rigid-motion case. We further harness this result to derive a matching bound to the sample complexity of the multi-target detection model that serves as an abstract framework for electron-microscopy-based technologies in structural biology, such as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Beyond theory, we present a provable computational pipeline for rigid-motion orbit recovery in three dimensions. Starting from rigid-motion autocorrelations, we extract the SO(3) moments and demonstrate successful reconstruction of a 3-D macromolecular structure. Importantly, this algorithmic approach is valid at any noise level, suggesting that even very small macromolecules, long believed to be inaccessible using structural biology electron-microscopy-based technologies, may, in principle, be reconstructed given sufficient data.

Title: On Conditional Independence Graph Learning From Multi-Attribute Gaussian Dependent Time Series
Authors: Jitendra K. Tugnait
Abstract: Estimation of the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian time series from multi-attribute data is considered. Existing methods for graph estimation for such data are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar time series with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector or vector time series. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning for dependent time series using a penalized log-likelihood objective function formulated in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform of the time-domain data. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm), local convexity when using non-convex penalties, and graph recovery. We do not impose any incoherence or irrepresentability condition for our convergence results. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on the Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.

Title: Dual-Stream Cross-Modal Representation Learning via Residual Semantic Decorrelation
Authors: Xuecheng Li, Weikuan Jia, Alisher Kurbonaliev, Qurbonaliev Alisher, Khudzhamkulov Rustam, Ismoilov Shuhratjon, Eshmatov Javhariddin, Yuanjie Zheng
Abstract: Cross-modal learning has become a fundamental paradigm for integrating heterogeneous information sources such as images, text, and structured attributes. However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while naïve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.

Title: Bimorph Lithium Niobate Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers
Authors: Vakhtang Chulukhadze, Zihuan Liu, Ziqian Yao, Lezli Matto, Tzu-Hsuan Hsu, Nishanth Ravi, Xiaoyu Niu, Michael E. Liao, Mark S. Goorsky, Neal Hall, Ruochen Lu
Abstract: Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform.

Title: Wholesale Market Participation via Competitive DER Aggregation
Authors: Cong Chen, Ahmed S. Alahmed, Timothy D. Mount, Lang Tong
Abstract: We consider the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar PV, energy storage, and flexible loads, by a profit-seeking aggregator participating directly in the wholesale market under distribution network access constraints. We propose a competitive DER aggregator (DERA) model that directly controls local DERs to maximize its profits, while ensuring each aggregated customer gains a surplus higher than their surplus under the regulated retail tariff. The DERA participates in the wholesale electricity market as virtual storage with optimized generation offers and consumption bids derived from the propoed competitive aggregation model. Also derived are DERA's bid curves for the distribution network access and DERA's profitability when competing with the regulated retail tariff. We show that, with the same distribution network access, the proposed DERA's wholesale market participation achieves the same welfare-maximizing outcome as when its customers participate directly in the wholesale market. Extensive numerical studies compare the proposed DERA with existing methods in terms of customer surplus and DERA profit. We empirically evaluate how many DERAs can survive in the competition at long-run equilibrium, and assess the impacts of DER adoption levels and distribution network access on short-run operations.

Title: A New Framework for Bounding Reachability Probabilities of Continuous-time Stochastic Systems
Authors: Bai Xue
Abstract: This manuscript presents an innovative framework for constructing barrier functions to bound reachability probabilities for continuous-time stochastic systems described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The reachability probabilities considered in this paper encompass two aspects: the probability of reaching a set of specified states within a predefined finite time horizon, and the probability of reaching a set of specified states at a particular time instant. The barrier functions presented in this manuscript are developed either by relaxing a parabolic partial differential equation that characterizes the exact reachability probability or by applying the Grönwall's inequality. In comparison to the prevailing construction method, which relies on Doob's non-negative supermartingale inequality (or Ville's inequality), the proposed barrier functions provide stronger alternatives, complement existing methods, or fill gaps.

Title: Distributed Traffic Signal Control of Interconnected Intersections: A Two-Lane Traffic Network Model
Authors: Xinfeng Ru, Ting Bai, Weiguo Xia, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate traffic signal control in a network of interconnected intersections, aiming to balance lane-level vehicle densities through optimal green-time allocation. We develop a two-lane traffic flow model that explicitly captures lane-specific propagation dynamics, addressing key limitations of conventional road-level formulations. The proposed model offers a more granular and flexible representation of urban traffic, enabling controllers to react more accurately to lane-specific congestion patterns. Building on this model, we design a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework and integrate it with the efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to enhance scalability and real-time performance. To accommodate time-varying traffic conditions, we further introduce a data-driven method for forecasting dynamic split ratios. Comprehensive VISSIM simulations on a six-intersection network in Dalian, China, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing signal control strategies in both traffic efficiency and computational speed, showing its promise for real-time deployment.

Title: Deep Spatiotemporal Clutter Filtering of Transthoracic Echocardiographic Images: Leveraging Contextual Attention and Residual Learning
Authors: Mahdi Tabassian, Somayeh Akbari, Sandro Queirós, Jan D'hooge
Abstract: This study presents a deep convolutional autoencoder network for filtering reverberation clutter from transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) image sequences. Given the spatiotemporal nature of this type of clutter, the filtering network employs 3D convolutional layers to suppress it throughout the cardiac cycle. The design of the network incorporates two key features that contribute to the effectiveness of the filter: 1) an attention mechanism for focusing on cluttered regions and leveraging contextual information, and 2) residual learning for preserving fine image structures. To train the network, a diverse set of artifact patterns was simulated and superimposed onto ultra-realistic synthetic TTE sequences from six ultrasound vendors, generating input for the filtering network. The artifact-free sequences served as ground-truth. Performance of the filtering network was evaluated using unseen synthetic and in vivo artifactual sequences. Results from the in vivo dataset confirmed the network's strong generalization capabilities, despite being trained solely on synthetic data and simulated artifacts. The suitability of the filtered sequences for downstream processing was assessed by computing segmental strain curves. A significant reduction in the discrepancy between strain profiles computed from cluttered and clutter-free segments was observed after filtering the cluttered sequences with the proposed network. The trained network processes a TTE sequence in a fraction of a second, enabling real-time clutter filtering and potentially improving the precision of clinically relevant indices derived from TTE sequences. The source code of the proposed method and example video files of the filtering results are available at: this https URL.

Title: Tyche: Stochastic In-Context Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Marianne Rakic, Hallee E. Wong, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, Beth Cimini, John Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca
Abstract: Existing learning-based solutions to medical image segmentation have two important shortcomings. First, for most new segmentation task, a new model has to be trained or fine-tuned. This requires extensive resources and machine learning expertise, and is therefore often infeasible for medical researchers and clinicians. Second, most existing segmentation methods produce a single deterministic segmentation mask for a given image. In practice however, there is often considerable uncertainty about what constitutes the correct segmentation, and different expert annotators will often segment the same image differently. We tackle both of these problems with Tyche, a model that uses a context set to generate stochastic predictions for previously unseen tasks without the need to retrain. Tyche differs from other in-context segmentation methods in two important ways. (1) We introduce a novel convolution block architecture that enables interactions among predictions. (2) We introduce in-context test-time augmentation, a new mechanism to provide prediction stochasticity. When combined with appropriate model design and loss functions, Tyche can predict a set of plausible diverse segmentation candidates for new or unseen medical images and segmentation tasks without the need to retrain.

Title: Self-supervised Learning-based Reconstruction of High-resolution 4D Light Fields
Authors: Jianxin Lei, Dongze Wu, Chengcai Xu, Hongcheng Gu, Guangquan Zhou, Junhui Hou, Ping Zhou
Abstract: Hand-held light field (LF) cameras often exhibit low spatial resolution due to the inherent trade-off between spatial and angular dimensions. Existing supervised learning-based LF spatial super-resolution (SR) methods, which rely on pre-defined image degradation models, struggle to overcome the domain gap between the training phase -- where LFs with natural resolution are used as ground truth -- and the inference phase, which aims to reconstruct higher-resolution LFs, especially when applied to real-world this http URL address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning-based method for LF spatial SR, which can produce higher spatial resolution LF images than originally captured ones without pre-defined image degradation models. The self-supervised method incorporates a hybrid LF imaging prototype, a real-world hybrid LF dataset, and a self-supervised LF spatial SR framework. The prototype makes reference image pairs between low-resolution central-view sub-aperture images and high-resolution (HR) images. The self-supervised framework consists of a well-designed LF spatial SR network with hybrid input, a central-view synthesis network with an HR-aware loss that enables side-view sub-aperture images to learn high-frequency information from the only HR central view reference image, and a backward degradation network with an epipolar-plane image gradient loss to preserve LF parallax structures. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in reconstructing higher spatial resolution LF images without pre-defined degradation.

Title: CT Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion Models for Abdominal Lymph Node Segmentation
Authors: Yongrui Yu, Hanyu Chen, Zitian Zhang, Qiong Xiao, Wenhui Lei, Linrui Dai, Yu Fu, Hui Tan, Guan Wang, Peng Gao, Xiaofan Zhang
Abstract: Despite the significant success achieved by deep learning methods in medical image segmentation, researchers still struggle in the computer-aided diagnosis of abdominal lymph nodes due to the complex abdominal environment, small and indistinguishable lesions, and limited annotated data. To address these problems, we present a pipeline that integrates the conditional diffusion model for lymph node generation and the nnU-Net model for lymph node segmentation to improve the segmentation performance of abdominal lymph nodes through synthesizing a diversity of realistic abdominal lymph node data. We propose LN-DDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for lymph node (LN) generation. LN-DDPM utilizes lymph node masks and anatomical structure masks as model conditions. These conditions work in two conditioning mechanisms: global structure conditioning and local detail conditioning, to distinguish between lymph nodes and their surroundings and better capture lymph node characteristics. The obtained paired abdominal lymph node images and masks are used for the downstream segmentation task. Experimental results on the abdominal lymph node datasets demonstrate that LN-DDPM outperforms other generative methods in the abdominal lymph node image synthesis and better assists the downstream abdominal lymph node segmentation task.

Title: Precoding Design for Limited-Feedback MIMO Systems via Character-Polynomial Codes
Authors: Siva Aditya Gooty, Samin Riasat, Hessam Mahdavifar, Robert W. Heath Jr
Abstract: We consider the problem of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication with limited feedback, where the transmitter relies on a limited number of bits associated with the channel state information (CSI), available at the receiver (CSIR) but not at the transmitter (no CSIT), sent via the feedback link. We demonstrate how character-polynomial (CP) codes, a class of analog subspace codes (also, referred to as Grassmann codes) can be used for the corresponding quantization problem in the Grassmann space. The proposed CP codebook-based precoding design allows for a smooth trade-off between the number of feedback bits and the beamforming gain, by simply adjusting the rate of the underlying CP code. We present a theoretical upper bound on the \textit{mean squared quantization error} of the CP codebook for Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) communication system and utilize it to upper bound the resulting \textit{distortion} with perfect CSIT. We show that the distortion vanishes asymptotically. We compute the EGT baseline gain for MIMO systems with two receive antennas and observe that the CP gain approaches the EGT gain for MIMO system. The results are also confirmed via simulations for different types of fading models for both uncorrelated and correlated channels in the MISO and MIMO systems.

Title: DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation
Authors: Dongya Jia, Zhuo Chen, Jiawei Chen, Chenpeng Du, Jian Wu, Jian Cong, Xiaobin Zhuang, Chumin Li, Zhen Wei, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.

Title: On the $H$-property for Step-graphons: The Residual Case
Authors: Wanting Gao, Xudong Chen
Abstract: We investigate the $H$-property for step-graphons. Specifically, we sample graphs $G_n$ on $n$ nodes from a step-graphon and evaluate the probability that $G_n$ has a Hamiltonian decomposition in the asymptotic regime as $n\to\infty$. It has been shown that for almost all step-graphons, this probability converges to either zero or one. We focus in this paper on the residual case where the zero-one law does not apply. We show that the limit of the probability still exists and provide an explicit expression of it. We present a complete proof of the result and validate it through numerical studies.

Title: T1-PILOT: Optimized Trajectories for T1 Mapping Acceleration
Authors: Tamir Shor, Moti Freiman, Chaim Baskin, Alex Bronstein
Abstract: Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial tissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis, inflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times.

Title: Optimizing Parameter Estimation for Electrochemical Battery Model: A Comparative Analysis of Operating Profiles on Computational Efficiency and Accuracy
Authors: Feng Guo, Luis D. Couto, Khiem Trad, Grietus Mulder, Keivan Haghverdi, Guillaume Thenaisie
Abstract: Parameter estimation in electrochemical models remains a significant challenge in their application. This study investigates the impact of different operating profiles on electrochemical model parameter estimation to identify the optimal conditions. In particular, the present study is focused on Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(NMC) lithium-ion batteries. Based on five fundamental current profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST), 31 combinations of conditions were generated and used for parameter estimation and validation, resulting in 961 evaluation outcomes. The Particle Swarm Optimization is employed for parameter identification in electrochemical models, specifically using the Single Particle Model (SPM). The analysis considered three dimensions: model voltage output error, parameter estimation error, and time cost. Results show that using all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output error, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The shortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage output and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal. For minimizing model voltage output error and time cost, {C/2, 1C} is best, while {1C} is ideal for parameter error and time cost. The comprehensive optimal condition is {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST}. These findings provide guidance for selecting current conditions tailored to specific needs.

Title: Collaborative Drill Alignment in Surgical Robotics
Authors: Daniel Larby, Joshua Kershaw, Matthew Allen, Fulvio Forni
Abstract: Robotic assistance allows surgeries to be reliably and accurately executed while still under direct supervision of the surgeon, combining the strengths of robotic technology with the surgeon's expertise. This paper describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon's control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches -- which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers -- our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision, and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient specific guides (PSG). Discussion and future improvements follow.

Title: Echo-E$^3$Net: Efficient Endocardial Spatio-Temporal Network for Ejection Fraction Estimation
Authors: Moein Heidari, Afshin Bozorgpour, AmirHossein Zarif-Fakharnia, Wenjin Chen, Dorit Merhof, David J Foran, Jasmine Grewal, Ilker Hacihaliloglu
Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and is routinely used to diagnose heart failure and guide treatment decisions. Although deep learning has advanced automated LVEF estimation, many existing approaches are computationally demanding and underutilize the joint structure of spatial and temporal information in echocardiography videos, limiting their suitability for real-time clinical deployment. We propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient endocardial spatio-temporal network specifically designed for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Echo-E$^3$Net comprises two complementary modules: (1) a dual-phase Endocardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD), which uses phase-specific cross-attention to predict ED/ES endocardial landmarks (EBs) and learn phase-aware landmark embeddings (LEs), and (2) an Endocardial Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA), which fuses these embeddings with global statistical descriptors (mean, maximum, variance) of deep feature maps to refine EF regression. A multi-component loss function, inspired by Simpson's biplane method, jointly supervises EF, volumes, and landmark geometry, thereby aligning optimization with the clinical definition of LVEF and promoting robust spatio-temporal representation learning. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, Echo-E$^3$Net achieves an RMSE of 5.20 and an $R^2$ score of 0.82, while using only 1.54M parameters and 8.05 GFLOPs. The model operates without external pre-training, heavy data augmentation, or test-time ensembling, making it highly suitable for real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications.

Title: Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation
Authors: Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.

Title: Iterative VCG-based Mechanism Fosters Cooperation in Multi-Regional Network Design
Authors: Mingjia He, Yannik Werner, Andrea Censi, Emilio Frazzoli, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Transportation network design often involves multiple stakeholders with diverse priorities. We consider a system with a hierarchical multi-agent structure, featuring self-optimized subnetwork operators at the lower level and a central organization at the upper level. Independent regional planning can lead to inefficiencies due to the lack of coordination, hindering interregional travel and cross-border infrastructure development, while centralized methods may struggle to align local interests and can be impractical to implement. To support decision making for such a system, we introduce an iterative VCG-based mechanism for multi-regional network design that fosters cooperation among subnetwork operators. By leveraging the Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, the framework determines collective investment decisions and the necessary payments from both operators and the central organization to achieve efficient outcomes. A case study on the European Railway System validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in overall network performance through enhanced cross-region cooperation.

Title: Optimizing Age of Information in Networks with Large and Small Updates
Authors: Zhuoyi Zhao, Vishrant Tripathi, Igor Kadota
Abstract: Modern sensing and monitoring applications typically consist of sources transmitting updates of different sizes, ranging from a few bytes (position, temperature, etc.) to multiple megabytes (images, video frames, LIDAR point scans, etc.). Existing approaches to wireless scheduling for information freshness typically ignore this mix of large and small updates, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider a single-hop wireless broadcast network with sources transmitting updates of different sizes to a base station over unreliable links. Some sources send large updates spanning many time slots while others send small updates spanning only a few time slots. Due to medium access constraints, only one source can transmit to the base station at any given time, thus requiring careful design of scheduling policies that takes the sizes of updates into account. First, we derive a lower bound on the achievable Age of Information (AoI) by any transmission scheduling policy. Second, we develop optimal randomized policies that consider both switching and no-switching during the transmission of large updates. Third, we introduce a novel Lyapunov function and associated analysis to propose an AoI-based Max-Weight policy that has provable constant factor optimality guarantees. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed scheduling policies through simulations, which show that our Max-Weight policy achieves near-optimal AoI performance.

Title: MLICv2: Enhanced Multi-Reference Entropy Modeling for Learned Image Compression
Authors: Wei Jiang, Yongqi Zhai, Jiayu Yang, Feng Gao, Ronggang Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in learned image compression (LIC) have achieved remarkable performance improvements over traditional codecs. Notably, the MLIC series-LICs equipped with multi-reference entropy models-have substantially surpassed conventional image codecs such as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Intra. However, existing MLIC variants suffer from several limitations: performance degradation at high bitrates due to insufficient transform capacity, suboptimal entropy modeling that fails to capture global correlations in initial slices, and lack of adaptive channel importance modeling. In this paper, we propose MLICv2 and MLICv2+, enhanced successors that systematically address these limitations through improved transform design, dvanced entropy modeling, and exploration of the potential of instance-specific optimization. For transform enhancement, we introduce a lightweight token mixing block inspired by the MetaFormer architecture, which effectively mitigates high-bitrate performance degradation while maintaining computational efficiency. For entropy modeling improvements, we propose hyperprior-guided global correlation prediction to extract global context even in the initial slice of latent representation, complemented by a channel reweighting module that dynamically emphasizes informative channels. We further explore enhanced positional embedding and guided selective compression strategies for superior context modeling. Additionally, we apply the Stochastic Gumbel Annealing (SGA) to demonstrate the potential for further performance improvements through input-specific optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLICv2 and MLICv2+ achieve state-of-the-art results, reducing Bjøntegaard-Delta Rate by 16.54%, 21.61%, 16.05% and 20.46%, 24.35%, 19.14% on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC Pro Val datasets, respectively, compared to VTM-17.0 Intra.

Title: Near-Field Beamfocusing, Localization, and Channel Estimation with Modular Linear Arrays
Authors: Alva Kosasih, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson
Abstract: This paper investigates how near-field beamfocusing can be achieved using a modular linear array (MLA), composed of multiple widely spaced uniform linear arrays (ULAs). The MLA architecture extends the aperture length of a standard ULA without adding additional antennas, thereby enabling near-field beamfocusing without increasing processing complexity. Unlike conventional far-field beamforming, near-field beamfocusing enables simultaneous data transmission to multiple users at different distances in the same angular interval, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of the beamwidth and beamdepth achievable with the MLA and show that by appropriately selecting the number of antennas in each constituent ULA, ideal near-field beamfocusing can be realized. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient localization method that fuses estimates from each ULA, enabling efficient parametric channel estimation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expressions and that MLAs achieve near-field beamfocusing with a limited number of antennas, making them a promising solution for next-generation wireless systems.

Title: Stochastic Orthogonal Regularization for deep projective priors
Authors: Ali Joundi (UB), Yann Traonmilin (UB), Alasdair Newson (ISIR)
Abstract: Many crucial tasks of image processing and computer vision are formulated as inverse problems. Thus, it is of great importance to design fast and robust algorithms to solve these problems. In this paper, we focus on generalized projected gradient descent (GPGD) algorithms where generalized projections are realized with learned neural networks and provide state-of-the-art results for imaging inverse problems. Indeed, neural networks allow for projections onto unknown low-dimensional sets that model complex data, such as images. We call these projections deep projective priors. In generic settings, when the orthogonal projection onto a lowdimensional model set is used, it has been shown, under a restricted isometry assumption, that the corresponding orthogonal PGD converges with a linear rate, yielding near-optimal convergence (within the class of GPGD methods) in the classical case of sparse recovery. However, for deep projective priors trained with classical mean squared error losses, there is little guarantee that the hypotheses for linear convergence are satisfied. In this paper, we propose a stochastic orthogonal regularization of the training loss for deep projective priors. This regularization is motivated by our theoretical results: a sufficiently good approximation of the orthogonal projection guarantees linear stable recovery with performance close to orthogonal PGD. We show experimentally, using two different deep projective priors (based on autoencoders and on denoising networks), that our stochastic orthogonal regularization yields projections that improve convergence speed and robustness of GPGD in challenging inverse problem settings, in accordance with our theoretical findings.

Title: Application of Quaternions to Obtain Analytic Solutions to Systems of Polarization Components
Authors: Michael G. Taylor
Abstract: This paper describes the passage of light through a system of waveplates mathematically in terms of quaternions, an extension of the complex numbers, instead of the more usual Jones vectors and Jones matrices. Both the light beam and the waveplate are represented by a quaternion. It is possible to manipulate the quaternion expression more readily than the Jones matrix-vector expression; for example it can be inverted. The quaternion form of a waveplate is compactly related to its retardance and fast/slow axes, and the quaternion of a signal is closely related to its state of polarization (SOP), either expressed as a vector on the Poincaré sphere or as a polarization ellipse. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical signals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their quaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or change the SOP. Several mathematical tools are identified, such as partial conjugation, to rearrange a quaternion expression, a tricky operation because multiplication does not commute. Put together, these advances let us understand how waveplates can act on a light beam to produce desired behavior. Finally, the quaternion math is put to work on two problems. A new endless optical phase shift system is designed out of waveplates. A prior solution to the problem used five waveplates, and in this paper the same task is done with only three waveplates. Also, failures of a polarization controller are studied, and found to be caused by singularities, which can occur frequently.

Authors: Savannah P. Hays, Lianrui Zuo, Anqi Feng, Yihao Liu, Blake E. Dewey, Jiachen Zhuo, Ellen M. Mowry, Scott D. Newsome, Jerry L. Prince, Aaron Carass
Abstract: Purpose: Visualization of subcortical gray matter is essential in neuroscience and clinical practice, particularly for disease understanding and surgical this http URL multi-inversion time (multi-TI) T$_1$-weighted (T$_1$-w) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging improves visualization, it is rarely acquired in clinical settings. Approach: We present SyMTIC (Synthetic Multi-TI Contrasts), a deep learning method that generates synthetic multi-TI images using routinely acquired T$_1$-w, T$_2$-weighted (T$_2$-w), and FLAIR images. Our approach combines image translation via deep neural networks with imaging physics to estimate longitudinal relaxation time (T$_1$) and proton density (PD) maps. These maps are then used to compute multi-TI images with arbitrary inversion times. Results: SyMTIC was trained using paired MPRAGE and FGATIR images along with T$_2$-w and FLAIR images. It accurately synthesized multi-TI images from standard clinical inputs, achieving image quality comparable to that from explicitly acquired multi-TI this http URL synthetic images, especially for TI values between 400-800 ms, enhanced visualization of subcortical structures and improved segmentation of thalamic nuclei. Conclusion: SyMTIC enables robust generation of high-quality multi-TI images from routine MR contrasts. It generalizes well to varied clinical datasets, including those with missing FLAIR images or unknown parameters, offering a practical solution for improving brain MR image visualization and analysis.

Title: Robust brain age estimation from structural MRI with contrastive learning
Authors: Carlo Alberto Barbano, Benoit Dufumier, Edouard Duchesnay, Marco Grangetto, Pietro Gori
Abstract: Estimating brain age from structural MRI has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing normative and pathological aging. In this work, we explore contrastive learning as a scalable and robust alternative to L1-supervised approaches for brain age estimation. We introduce a novel contrastive loss function, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$, and evaluate it across multiple public neuroimaging datasets comprising over 20,000 scans. Our experiments reveal four key findings. First, scaling pre-training on diverse, multi-site data consistently improves generalization performance, cutting external mean absolute error (MAE) nearly in half. Second, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ is robust to site-related confounds, maintaining low scanner-predictability as training size increases. Third, contrastive models reliably capture accelerated aging in patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as shown through brain age gap analysis, ROC curves, and longitudinal trends. Lastly, unlike L1-supervised baselines, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ maintains a strong correlation between brain age accuracy and downstream diagnostic performance, supporting its potential as a foundation model for neuroimaging. These results position contrastive learning as a promising direction for building generalizable and clinically meaningful brain representations.

Title: Hybrid Precoding Revisited: Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective for MU-MIMO Systems
Authors: Mintaek Oh, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: This letter presents a low-complexity hybrid precoding framework for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging a low-dimensional subspace property. Under the low-dimensional subspace perspective, we first identify an unconstrained optimal radio-frequency (RF) precoder. We then optimize a hybrid precoder via a reduced-complexity precoding method. We further extend the proposed framework to (i) a dynamic-subarray antenna partitioning algorithm that adaptively allocates subsets of antennas associated with RF chains, and (ii) a channel covariance-based approach to exploit statistical channel state information at a transmitter (CSIT), ensuring robustness with partial CSIT. Simulations validate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance while significantly reducing complexity compared to existing methods.

Title: Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach
Authors: Negar Monir, Youssef Ait Si, Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap, Adnane Saoud, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. We first demonstrate correctness and monotone refinement of guarantees for two subsystems. Then, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-horizon reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples and a nonlinear DC microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework on verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.

Title: A Biophysically-Conditioned Generative Framework for 3D Brain Tumor MRI Synthesis
Authors: Valentin Biller, Lucas Zimmer, Ayhan Can Erdur, Sandeep Nagar, Daniel Rückert, Niklas Bubeck, Jonas Weidner
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5, and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at: this https URL

Title: Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics
Authors: Ilija Tanasković, Ljiljana B. Lazarević, Goran Knežević, Nikola Milosavljević, Olga Dubljević, Bojana Bjegojević, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. Proposed complementary analyses indicate that the individuality is primarily encoded in the QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.

Title: Observer Design for Networked Linear Systems with Fast and Slow Dynamics under Measurement Noise
Authors: Weixuan Wang, Alejandro I. Maass, Dragan Nešić, Ying Tan, Romain Postoyan, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for networked control systems (NCS) with linear plants that operate at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

Title: Evaluation of Large Language Models for Numeric Anomaly Detection in Power Systems
Authors: Yichen Liu, Hongyu Wu, Bo Liu
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in power grids for their general-purpose capabilities. Meanwhile, anomaly detection (AD) remains critical for grid resilience, requiring accurate and interpretable decisions based on multivariate telemetry. Yet the performance of LLMs on large-scale numeric data for AD remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for numeric AD in power systems. We use GPT-OSS-20B as a representative model and evaluate it on the IEEE 14-bus system. A standardized prompt framework is applied across zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning, and a hybrid LLM-traditional approach. We adopt a rule-aware design based on the three-sigma criterion, and report detection performance and rationale quality. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into the limitations and capabilities of LLM-based AD and its integration with classical detectors in cyber-physical power grid applications.

Title: Diffusion-Prior Split Gibbs Sampling for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging under Incomplete Measurements
Authors: Hefei Gao, Tianyao Huang, Letian Guo, Jie He, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios.

Abstract: This letter proposes an AC/DC frequency-dependent power flow Jacobian analysis to identify the system support capabilities. In addition, the analyses reveal that system support capabilities do not necessarily enhance the system stability margin, suggesting that technical requirements of narrow-frequency-band and AC-side focused specifications may not lead to the expected performance of GFM.

Title: An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits
Authors: Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Gabriel Gleizer
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results on their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the information theory of lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems. Rate measures abstraction size, while distortion describes accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum achievable abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and the abstraction size; and vice-versa a lower bound on the minimum size, for given distortion. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through trajectory entropy. We demonstrate its tightness on some dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how this new theory enables constructing minimal abstractions, optimizing the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.

Title: Stability-Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering for Electrochemical Battery State Estimation
Authors: Feng Guo, Guangdi Hu, Keyi Liao, Luis D. Couto, Khiem Trad, Ru Hong, Hamid Hamed, Mohammadhosein Safari
Abstract: Accurate and stable state estimation is critical for battery management. Although dual Kalman filtering can jointly estimate states and parameters, the strong coupling between filters may cause divergence under large initialization errors or model mismatch. This paper proposes a Stability Guaranteed Dual Kalman Filtering (SG-DKF) method. A Lyapunov-based analysis yields a sufficient stability condition, leading to an adaptive dead-zone rule that suspends parameter updates when the innovation exceeds a stability bound. Applied to an electrochemical battery model, SG-DKF achieves accuracy comparable to a dual EKF and reduces state of charge RMSE by over 45% under large initial state errors.

Title: General and Domain-Specific Zero-shot Detection of Generated Images via Conditional Likelihood
Authors: Roy Betser, Omer Hofman, Roman Vainshtein, Guy Gilboa
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, has significantly improved the realism of synthetic images. As new generative models continuously emerge, detecting generated images remains a critical challenge. While fully supervised, and few-shot methods have been proposed, maintaining an updated dataset is time-consuming and challenging. Consequently, zero-shot methods have gained increasing attention in recent years. We find that existing zero-shot methods often struggle to adapt to specific image domains, such as artistic images, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce CLIDE, a novel zero-shot detection method based on conditional likelihood approximation. Our approach computes likelihoods conditioned on real images, enabling adaptation across diverse image domains. We extensively evaluate CLIDE, demonstrating SOTA performance on a large-scale general dataset and significantly outperform existing methods in domain-specific cases. These results demonstrate the robustness of our method and underscore the need of broad, domain-aware generalization for the AI-generated image detection task. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Power Grid Control
Authors: Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tinko Sebastian Bartels
Abstract: The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.

Title: RIS-Assisted Generalized Receive Quadrature Spatial Modulation with Extension to Multicast Communications
Authors: Mohamad H. Dinan, Khatereh Nadali, Mark F. Flanagan
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted generalized receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-GRQSM) scheme to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of RIS-aided \textit{quadrature} spatial modulation (QSM) systems. By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.

Title: Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline
Authors: Hannah J. Smith, Blanca Rodriguez, Yuling Sang, Marcel Beetz, Robin P. Choudhury, Vicente Grau, Abhirup Banerjee
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification in myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomical features and their interdependence. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. We found that female hearts were positioned more posteriorly and superiorly than male, and in MI hearts were oriented more horizontally, especially for women. Post-MI women exhibited less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS duration was associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women was striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations were more strongly associated with posterior and horizontal cardiac positioning in women than in men. Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.

Title: Is Self-Supervised Learning Enough to Fill in the Gap? A Study on Speech Inpainting
Authors: Ihab Asaad, Maxime Jacquelin, Olivier Perrotin, Laurent Girin, Thomas Hueber
Abstract: Speech inpainting consists in reconstructing corrupted or missing speech segments using surrounding context, a process that closely resembles the pretext tasks in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for speech encoders. This study investigates using SSL-trained speech encoders for inpainting without any additional training beyond the initial pretext task, and simply adding a decoder to generate a waveform. We compare this approach to supervised fine-tuning of speech encoders for a downstream task -- here, inpainting. Practically, we integrate HuBERT as the SSL encoder and HiFi-GAN as the decoder in two configurations: (1) fine-tuning the decoder to align with the frozen pre-trained encoder's output and (2) fine-tuning the encoder for an inpainting task based on a frozen decoder's input. Evaluations are conducted under single- and multi-speaker conditions using in-domain datasets and out-of-domain datasets (including unseen speakers, diverse speaking styles, and noise). Both informed and blind inpainting scenarios are considered, where the position of the corrupted segment is either known or unknown. The proposed SSL-based methods are benchmarked against several baselines, including a text-informed method combining automatic speech recognition with zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Performance is assessed using objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. The results demonstrate that both approaches outperform baselines, successfully reconstructing speech segments up to 200 ms, and sometimes up to 400 ms. Notably, fine-tuning the SSL encoder achieves more accurate speech reconstruction in single-speaker settings, while a pre-trained encoder proves more effective for multi-speaker scenarios. This demonstrates that an SSL pretext task can transfer to speech inpainting, enabling successful speech reconstruction with a pre-trained encoder.

Title: An Open-Source Soft Robotic Platform for Autonomous Aerial Manipulation in the Wild
Authors: Erik Bauer, Marc Blöchlinger, Pascal Strauch, Arman Raayatsanati, Curdin Cavelti, Robert K. Katzschmann
Abstract: Aerial manipulation combines the versatility and speed of flying platforms with the functional capabilities of mobile manipulation, which presents significant challenges due to the need for precise localization and control. Traditionally, researchers have relied on offboard perception systems, which are limited to expensive and impractical specially equipped indoor environments. In this work, we introduce a novel platform for autonomous aerial manipulation that exclusively utilizes onboard perception systems. Our platform can perform aerial manipulation in various indoor and outdoor environments without depending on external perception systems. Our experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to autonomously grasp various objects in diverse settings. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and practicality of aerial manipulation applications by eliminating the need for costly tracking solutions. To accelerate future research, we open source our ROS 2 software stack and custom hardware design, making our contributions accessible to the broader research community.

Title: Tokenizing Motion: A Generative Approach for Scene Dynamics Compression
Authors: Shanzhi Yin, Zihan Zhang, Bolin Chen, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

Title: Near-Pilotless Single Carrier Communications Using Matrix Decomposition
Authors: K Sai Praneeth, P Aswathylakshmi, Radhakrishna Ganti
Abstract: Single Input-Multiple Output (SIMO) systems are key enablers of high data rates in the next generation wireless communications. However in SIMO systems, channel estimation and equalization are challenging particularly in the presence of rapidly changing channels. The high pilot overhead required for channel estimation can reduce the system throughput for large antenna configuration. In this paper, we provide an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm for near-pilotless or blind decoding of SIMO signals, in a single carrier system with frequency domain equalization. This novel approach replaces the standard equalization and estimates both the transmitted data and the channel without the knowledge of any prior distributions, by making use of only one pilot. Our simulations demonstrate improved performance, in terms of error rates, compared to the more widely used pilot-based Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) method.

Title: A Methodology for Process Design Kit Re-Centering Using TCAD and Experimental Data for Cryogenic Temperatures
Authors: Tapas Dutta, Fikru Adamu-Lema, Djamel Bensouiah, Asen Asenov
Abstract: In this work, we describe and demonstrate a novel Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) driven methodology to re-center room-temperature Process Design Kits (PDKs) for cryogenic operation using a limited set of experimental measurements. Unlike previous approaches that relied on direct fitting of sparse measurements, our technique accounts for process-induced deviations by calibrating TCAD models to both room-temperature and cryogenic data. Compact models for all process corners are extracted from TCAD-generated target characteristics, enabling accurate cryogenic modeling without dedicated foundry support. This scalable, technology-independent method provides a practical path for cryogenic circuit design.

Title: Target Speaker Extraction through Comparing Noisy Positive and Negative Audio Enrollments
Authors: Shitong Xu, Yiyuan Yang, Niki Trigoni, Andrew Markham
Abstract: Target speaker extraction focuses on isolating a specific speaker's voice from an audio mixture containing multiple speakers. To provide information about the target speaker's identity, prior works have utilized clean audio samples as conditioning inputs. However, such clean audio examples are not always readily available. For instance, obtaining a clean recording of a stranger's voice at a cocktail party without leaving the noisy environment is generally infeasible. Limited prior research has explored extracting the target speaker's characteristics from noisy enrollments, which may contain overlapping speech from interfering speakers. In this work, we explore a novel enrollment strategy that encodes target speaker information from the noisy enrollment by comparing segments where the target speaker is talking (Positive Enrollments) with segments where the target speaker is silent (Negative Enrollments). Experiments show the effectiveness of our model architecture, which achieves over 2.1 dB higher SI-SNRi compared to prior works in extracting the monaural speech from the mixture of two speakers. Additionally, the proposed two-stage training strategy accelerates convergence, reducing the number of optimization steps required to reach 3 dB SNR by 60%. Overall, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the monaural target speaker extraction conditioned on noisy enrollments. Our implementation is available at this https URL .

Title: MAVERIX: Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX
Authors: Liuyue Xie, Avik Kuthiala, George Z. Wei, Ce Zheng, Ananya Bal, Mosam Dabhi, Liting Wen, Taru Rustagi, Ethan Lai, Sushil Khyalia, Rohan Choudhury, Morteza Ziyadi, Xu Zhang, Hao Yang, László A. Jeni
Abstract: We introduce MAVERIX (Multimodal audiovisual Evaluation and Recognition IndeX), a unified benchmark to probe the video understanding in multimodal LLMs, encompassing video, audio, text inputs with human performance baselines. Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to thoroughly assess their cross-modality comprehension performance. MAVERIX curates 2,556 questions from 700 videos, in the form of both multiple-choice and open-ended formats, explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through questions that necessitate tight integration of video and audio information, spanning a broad spectrum of agentic scenarios. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual questions, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration in such granularity. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Qwen 2.5 Omni and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, show performance around 64% accuracy, while human experts reach near-ceiling performance of 92.8%, exposing a substantial gap to human-level comprehension. With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.

Title: SteerMusic: Enhanced Musical Consistency for Zero-shot Text-guided and Personalized Music Editing
Authors: Xinlei Niu, Kin Wai Cheuk, Jing Zhang, Naoki Murata, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Michele Mancusi, Woosung Choi, Giorgio Fabbro, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Charles Patrick Martin, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Music editing is an important step in music production, which has broad applications, including game development and film production. Most existing zero-shot text-guided editing methods rely on pretrained diffusion models by involving forward-backward diffusion processes. However, these methods often struggle to preserve the musical content. Additionally, text instructions alone usually fail to accurately describe the desired music. In this paper, we propose two music editing methods that improve the consistency between the original and edited music by leveraging score distillation. The first method, SteerMusic, is a coarse-grained zero-shot editing approach using delta denoising score. The second method, SteerMusic+, enables fine-grained personalized music editing by manipulating a concept token that represents a user-defined musical style. SteerMusic+ allows for the editing of music into user-defined musical styles that cannot be achieved by the text instructions alone. Experimental results show that our methods outperform existing approaches in preserving both music content consistency and editing fidelity. User studies further validate that our methods achieve superior music editing quality.

Title: Sensing-Then-Beamforming: Robust Transmission Design for RIS-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication
Authors: Xingyu Zhao, Min Li, Ming-Min Zhao, Shihao Yan, Min-Jian Zhao
Abstract: Traditional covert communication often relies on the knowledge of the warden's channel state information, which is inherently challenging to obtain due to the non-cooperative nature and potential mobility of the warden. The integration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising solution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden, thereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a framework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISACC) systems, where the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's channel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert information to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS, under the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation errors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly designs the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at Alice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs while satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing, transmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this complex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one constraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert transmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to enhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also illustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISACC systems.

Title: Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters
Authors: Eviatar Bach, Ricardo Baptista, Edoardo Calvello, Bohan Chen, Andrew Stuart
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture. To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.

Title: Constrained Parameter Update Law for Adaptive Control
Authors: Ashwin P. Dani
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.

Title: Enhancing Monocular Height Estimation via Sparse LiDAR-Guided Correction
Authors: Jian Song, Hongruixuan Chen, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) optical imagery remains challenging due to limited structural cues and the high cost and geographic constraints of conventional elevation data such as airborne LiDAR and multi-view stereo. Although recent MHE and monocular depth estimation (MDE) models show strong performance, their robustness under varied illumination and scene conditions is still limited. We introduce a fully automated correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global LiDAR measurements from ICESat-2 with deep learning predictions to enhance accuracy and stability. The workflow relies entirely on publicly available models and data and requires only a single georeferenced optical image to produce corrected height maps, enabling low-cost and globally scalable deployment. We also establish the first benchmark for this task, evaluating two random forest based approaches, four parameter efficient fine tuning methods, and full fine tuning. Experiments across six diverse regions at 0.5 m resolution (297 km2), covering the urban cores of Tokyo, Paris, and Sao Paulo as well as suburban and forested areas, show substantial gains. The best method reduces the MHE model's mean absolute error (MAE) by 30.9 percent and improves its F1HE score by 44.2 percent. For the MDE model, MAE improves by 24.1 percent and the F1HE score by 25.1 percent. These results validate the effectiveness of our correction pipeline and demonstrate how sparse global LiDAR can systematically strengthen both MHE and MDE models, enabling scalable and widely accessible 3D height mapping.

Title: Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.

Title: Nonlinear Power Amplifier-Resilient Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Joint Optimization Approach
Authors: Wei Jiang, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: This letter analyzes the effects of power amplifiers (PAs) on the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO systems. We model signal transmission incorporating nonlinear PA distortion and derive a unified spectral efficiency (SE) expression applicable to arbitrary precoding schemes. To combat PA-induced performance degradation, a joint optimization approach for user association and max-min power control is proposed. Furthermore, a low-complexity alternative is developed to approximate the joint optimization with reduced computational overhead. Simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed approaches over conventional techniques.

Title: Deep Feature-specific Imaging
Authors: Yizhou Lu, Andreas Velten
Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.

Title: Image2Net: Datasets, Benchmark and Hybrid Framework to Convert Analog Circuit Diagrams into Netlists
Authors: Haohang Xu, Chengjie Liu, Qihang Wang, Wenhao Huang, Yongjian Xu, Weiyu Chen, Anlan Peng, Zhijun Li, Bo Li, Lei Qi, Jun Yang, Yuan Du, Li Du
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED) is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77% successful rate, which is 34.62%-45.19% higher than previous works. Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is 62.1%-69.6% lower than state-of-the-arts. Our datasets and benchmark are available at this https URL.

Title: Jointly Computation- and Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning
Authors: Xiaoxing Ren, Nicola Bastianello, Karl H. Johansson, Thomas Parisini
Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks. Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i) the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a classification task.

Title: Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals
Authors: Milan Marocchi, Matthew Fynn, Kayapanda Mandana, Yue Rong
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.

Title: Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Hanjiang Hu, Changliu Liu, Na Li, Yebin Wang
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in a lower bound of the multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks.

Title: Physics-Informed Inductive Biases for Voltage Prediction in Distribution Grids
Authors: Ehimare Okoyomon, Arbel Yaniv, Christoph Goebel
Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Title: Audio Palette: A Diffusion Transformer with Multi-Signal Conditioning for Controllable Foley Synthesis
Authors: Junnuo Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled high-quality text-to-audio synthesis, but fine-grained acoustic control remains a significant challenge in open-source research. We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals, loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85% of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more artist-centric workflow in the broader context of music and sound information retrieval.

Title: K-DAREK: Distance Aware Error for Kurkova Kolmogorov Networks
Authors: Masoud Ataei, Vikas Dhiman, Mohammad Javad Khojasteh
Abstract: Neural networks are powerful parametric function approximators, while Gaussian processes (GPs) are nonparametric probabilistic models that place distributions over functions via kernel-defined correlations but become computationally expensive for large-scale problems. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), semi-parametric neural architectures, model complex functions efficiently using spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend KANs by replacing the early spline layers with multi-layer perceptrons that map inputs into higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations, which yield more stable training and provide robust architectures for system modeling. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks (K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to its nearest training points. In safe control case studies, we demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times more computationally efficient than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than GP as data size increases, and 7.2% safer than our previous work distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK). Moreover, on real data (e.g., Real Estate Valuation), K-DAREK's error bound achieves zero coverage violations.

Title: Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives
Authors: Ali Asadi, Krishnendu Chatterjee, David Lurie, Raimundo Saona
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.

Title: Deep-Learning Based Super-Resolution Functional Ultrasound Imaging of Transient Brain-Wide Neurovascular Activity on a Microscopic Scale
Authors: Yang Cai, Shaoyuan Yan, Long Xu, Yanfeng Zhu, Bo Li, Kailiang Xu
Abstract: Transient brain-wide neuroimaging on a microscopic scale is pivotal for brain research, yet current modalities face challenges in meeting such spatiotemporal requirements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) enables transient neurovascular imaging through red blood cell backscattering, but suffers from diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We hypothesize that deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction can break through this limitation, introducing super-resolution functional ultrasound (SR-fUS) which leverages ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) data to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of red blood cell dynamics. By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS enables mapping ultrasound Doppler frames to super-resolution blood flow images, achieving 25-{\mu}m spatial and 0.2-s temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy.

Title: AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions
Authors: Pedro Passos
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.

Title: Disturbance Compensation for Safe Kinematic Control of Robotic Systems with Closed Architecture
Authors: Fan Zhang, Jinfeng Chen, Joseph J. B. Mvogo Ahanda, Hanz Richter, Ge Lv, Bin Hu, Qin Lin
Abstract: In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art. Video: this https URL
