Title: The Voice of Equity: A Systematic Evaluation of Bias Mitigation Techniques for Speech-Based Cognitive Impairment Detection Across Architectures and Demographics
Authors: Yasaman Haghbin, Sina Rashidi, Ali Zolnour, Maryam Zolnoori
Abstract: Speech-based detection of cognitive impairment offers a scalable, non-invasive screening, yet algorithmic bias across demographic and linguistic subgroups remains critically underexplored. We present the first comprehensive fairness analysis framework for speech-based multi-class cognitive impairment detection, systematically evaluating bias mitigation across architectures, and demographic subgroups. We developed two transformer-based architectures, SpeechCARE-AGF and Whisper-LWF-LoRA, on the multilingual NIA PREPARE Challenge dataset. Unlike prior work that typically examines single mitigation techniques, we compared pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing approaches, assessing fairness via Equality of Opportunity and Equalized Odds across gender, age, education, and language. Both models achieved strong performance (F1: SpeechCARE-AGF 70.87, Whisper-LWF-LoRA 71.46) but exhibited substantial fairness disparities. Adults >=80 showed lower sensitivity versus younger groups; Spanish speakers demonstrated reduced TPR versus English speakers. Mitigation effectiveness varied by architecture: oversampling improved SpeechCARE-AGF for older adults (80+ TPR: 46.19%=>49.97%) but minimally affected Whisper-LWF-LoRA. This study addresses a critical healthcare AI gap by demonstrating that architectural design fundamentally shapes bias patterns and mitigation effectiveness. Adaptive fusion mechanisms enable flexible responses to data interventions, while frequency reweighting offers robust improvements across architectures. Our findings establish that fairness interventions must be tailored to both model architecture and demographic characteristics, providing a systematic framework for developing equitable speech-based screening tools essential for reducing diagnostic disparities in cognitive healthcare.

Title: BickGraphing: Web-Based Application for Visual Inspection of Audio Recordings
Authors: Kayley Seow, Alexander Arovas, Grace Steinmetz, Emily Bick
Abstract: BickGraphing is a browser based research tool that enables visual inspection of acoustic recordings. The tool was built in support of visualizing crop feeding pest sounds in support of the Insect Eavesdropper project; however, it is widely applicable to all audiovisualizations in research. It allows multiple uploads of large .wav files, computes waveforms and spectrograms locally, and supports interactive exploration of audio events in time and frequency. The application is implemented as a SvelteKit and TypeScript web app with a client side signal processing pipeline using WebAssembly compiled FFmpeg and custom FFT utilities. The software is released on an open Git repository (this https URL) and archived under a standard MIT license and can be reused for rapid visual quality checks of .wav recordings in insect bioacoustics and related fields. BickGraphing has the potential to be a local, easy to use coding free visualization platform for audio data in research.

Title: PC-MCL: Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning with multi-label bias correction for respiratory sound classification
Authors: Seung Gyu Jeong, Seong-Eun Kim
Abstract: Automated respiratory sound classification supports the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. However, many deep models still rely on cycle-level analysis and suffer from patient-specific overfitting. We propose PC-MCL (Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning) to address these limitations by utilizing three key components: multi-cycle concatenation, a 3-label formulation, and a patient-matching auxiliary task. Our work resolves a multi-label distributional bias in respiratory sound classification, a critical issue inherent to applying multi-cycle concatenation with the conventional 2-label formulation (crackle, wheeze). This bias manifests as a systematic loss of normal signal information when normal and abnormal cycles are combined. Our proposed 3-label formulation (normal, crackle, wheeze) corrects this by preserving information from all constituent cycles in mixed samples. Furthermore, the patient-matching auxiliary task acts as a multi-task regularizer, encouraging the model to learn more robust features and improving generalization. On the ICBHI 2017 benchmark, PC-MCL achieves an ICBHI Score of 65.37%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that all three components are essential, working synergistically to improve the detection of abnormal respiratory events.

Title: Recovering Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition from Discrete Tokens via Multi-Layer Fusion and Paralinguistic Feature Integration
Authors: Esther Sun, Abinay Reddy Naini, Carlos Busso
Abstract: Discrete speech tokens offer significant advantages for storage and language model integration, but their application in speech emotion recognition (SER) is limited by paralinguistic information loss during quantization. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of discrete tokens for SER. Using a fine-tuned WavLM-Large model, we systematically quantify performance degradation across different layer configurations and k-means quantization granularities. To recover the information loss, we propose two key strategies: (1) attention-based multi-layer fusion to recapture complementary information from different layers, and (2) integration of openSMILE features to explicitly reintroduce paralinguistic cues. We also compare mainstream neural codec tokenizers (SpeechTokenizer, DAC, EnCodec) and analyze their behaviors when fused with acoustic features. Our findings demonstrate that through multi-layer fusion and acoustic feature integration, discrete tokens can close the performance gap with continuous representations in SER tasks.

Title: Inverter-Based Differential Amplifiers With Back-Gate Feedback Linearization
Authors: Eric Danson, Jeffrey S. Walling
Abstract: Feeding the common-source amplifier output to the back-gate terminal in fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) technology exploits the linearizing effect of negative feedback. Analysis and simulation results in 22 nm FD-SOI show that back-gate feedback sets the overall gain approximately independent of the load, contributes no additional noise, and improves linearity by the back-gate voltage gain. Third-order intercept point (IP3) enhancement is at least $60\times$ compared to without feedback in inverter-based, or complementary common-source, differential amplifiers.

Title: Fully 3D Unrolled Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting Reconstruction via Staged Pretraining and Implicit Gridding
Authors: Yonatan Urman, Mark Nishimura, Daniel Abraham, Xiaozhi Cao, Kawin Setsompop
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging, yet reconstructing high-resolution 3D data remains computationally demanding. Non-Cartesian reconstructions require repeated non-uniform FFTs, and the commonly used Locally Low Rank (LLR) prior adds computational overhead and becomes insufficient at high accelerations. Learned 3D priors could address these limitations, but training them at scale is challenging due to memory and runtime demands. We propose SPUR-iG, a fully 3D deep unrolled subspace reconstruction framework that integrates efficient data consistency with a progressive training strategy. Data consistency leverages implicit GROG, which grids non-Cartesian data onto a Cartesian grid with an implicitly learned kernel, enabling FFT-based updates with minimal artifacts. Training proceeds in three stages: (1) pretraining a denoiser with extensive data augmentation, (2) greedy per-iteration unrolled training, and (3) final fine-tuning with gradient checkpointing. Together, these stages make large-scale 3D unrolled learning feasible within a reasonable compute budget. On a large in vivo dataset with retrospective undersampling, SPUR-iG improves subspace coefficient maps quality and quantitative accuracy at 1-mm isotropic resolution compared with LLR and a hybrid 2D/3D unrolled baseline. Whole-brain reconstructions complete in under 15-seconds, with up to $\times$111 speedup for 2-minute acquisitions. Notably, $T_1$ maps with our method from 30-second scans achieve accuracy on par with or exceeding LLR reconstructions from 2-minute scans. Overall, the framework improves both accuracy and speed in large-scale 3D MRF reconstruction, enabling efficient and reliable accelerated quantitative imaging.

Title: Data-Efficient Physics-Informed Learning to Model Synchro-Waveform Dynamics of Grid-Integrated Inverter-Based Resources
Authors: Shivanshu Tripathi, Hossein Mohsenzadeh Yazdi, Maziar Raissi, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad
Abstract: Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.

Title: Set-Based Reachability for Low-Thrust Spacecraft in Two-Body and Cislunar Dynamical Systems
Authors: Jinaykumar Patel, Kamesh Subbarao
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of zonotope-based reachability analysis to low-thrust spacecraft in both two-body and cislunar environments. Reachable sets are generated under two-body and circular restricted three-body (CR3BP) dynamics using set-based methods that approximate nonlinear systems via Taylor expansions. A state-dependent coefficient (SDC) parameterization is also explored to represent nonlinear dynamics in a pseudo-linear form, enabling efficient matrix based propagation of reachable sets. Applications include Earth-Mars transfer and cislunar scenarios such as L1 and L2 Halo orbits and Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). The resulting reachable sets are used for safe trajectory generation and tracking, with comparisons drawn between model predictive control (MPC) and LQR-based station-keeping. The proposed approach provides a scalable framework for analyzing spacecraft behavior under complex dynamics and control constraints.

Title: Autonomous Mars Rover Module for Soil Sampling and Life Component Analysis
Authors: Bibek Adhikari, Rishab Rijal, Rakesh Yadav, Nikchey Khatri, Sandesh Dhakal
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a primary focus of scientific exploration, driven by rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe. The discovery of water on Mars has sparked significant interest, raising the question of whether life could exist on the planet. This study proposes a novel approach to simulate and illustrate the detection of life using a proof-of-life module integrated into a Mars rover. The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles. This proof-of-life module serves as a proof-of-concept for autonomous life detection in extraterrestrial environments and lays the foundation for future exploration missions.

Title: Robust and learning-augmented algorithms for degradation-aware battery optimization
Authors: Jack Umenberger, Anna Osguthorpe Rasmussen
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of maximizing revenue from a grid-scale battery energy storage system, accounting for uncertain future electricity prices and the effect of degradation on battery lifetime. We formulate this task as an online resource allocation problem. We propose an algorithm, based on online mirror descent, that is no-regret in the stochastic i.i.d. setting and attains finite asymptotic competitive ratio in the adversarial setting (robustness). When untrusted advice about the opportunity cost of degradation is available, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm that performs well when the advice is accurate (consistency) while still retaining robustness properties when the advice is poor.

Title: AstroTimer: Rethinking Non-Access Stratum Timers in LEO Constellations
Authors: Arshiya Rezaie Hezaveh, Peng Hu
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations expand 5G coverage to remote regions but differ fundamentally from terrestrial networks due to rapidly changing topologies, fluctuating delays, and constrained onboard resources. Existing 3GPP Non-Access Stratum (NAS) timers, inherited from terrestrial and geostationary (GEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems, fail to accommodate these dynamics, leading to signaling storms and inefficiency. This paper introduces AstroTimer, a lightweight, adaptive framework for sizing NAS timers based on LEO-specific parameters such as link variability, processing delays, and network-function placement. AstroTimer derives a closed-form timer model with low computational cost and optimizes both watchdog and backoff timers for the 5G registration procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that AstroTimer significantly reduces registration time, retry frequency, and user equipment (UE) energy consumption compared to 3GPP defaults, while preventing signaling overloads. The proposed approach provides an operator-ready foundation for reliable, efficient, and scalable non-terrestrial 5G/6G deployments.

Title: Polynomial Chaos-based Input Shaper Design under Time-Varying Uncertainty
Authors: Johannes Güttler, Karan Baker, Premjit Saha, James Warner, Adrian Stein
Abstract: The work presented here investigates the application of polynomial chaos expansion toward input shaper design in order to maintain robustness in dynamical systems subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, this work intends to specifically address time-varying uncertainty by employing intrusive polynomial chaos expansion. The methodology presented is validated through numerical simulation of intrusive polynomial chaos expansion formulation applied to spring mass system experiencing time-varying uncertainty in the spring stiffness. The system also evaluates non-robust and robust input shapers through the framework in order to identify designs that minimize residual energy. Results indicate that vibration mitigation is achieved at a similar accuracy, yet at higher efficiency compared to a Monte Carlo framework.

Title: Adaptive Input Shaper Design for Unknown Second-Order Systems with Real-Time Parameter Estimation
Authors: Nyi Nyi Aung, Bradley Wight, Adrian Stein
Abstract: We propose a feedforward input-shaping framework with online parameter estimation for unknown second-order systems. The proposed approach eliminates the need for prior knowledge of system parameters when designing input shaping for precise switching times by incorporating online estimation for a black-box system. The adaptive input shaping scheme accounts for the system's periodic switching behavior and enables reference shaping even when initial switching instants are missed. The proposed framework is evaluated in simulation and is intended for vibration suppression in motion control applications such as gantry cranes and 3D printer headers.

Title: RIS-Enabled Spoofing Against Adversary Sensing: CRB-Maximizing Design and Decoying Analysis
Authors: Ioannis Gavras, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This paper studies the capability of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), when transparently covering a User Equipment (UE), to deceive an adversary monostatic radar system. A compact RIS kernel model that explicitly links the radar's angular response to the RIS phase profile is introduced, enabling an analytical investigation of the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy with respect to the kernel's power. This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed. Selected numerical results confirm deep nulls at the true reflection AoA together with a pronounced decoy peak, rendering maximum-likelihood sensing at the adversary radar unreliable.

Title: Semantic-Aware Task Clustering for Federated Cooperative Multi-Task Semantic Communication
Authors: Ahmad Halimi Razlighi, Pallavi Dhingra, Edgar Beck, Bho Matthiesen, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) prioritizes task execution over accurate symbol reconstruction and is well-suited to emerging intelligent applications. Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom.

Title: A new approach for combined model class selection and parameters learning for auto-regressive neural models
Authors: Corrado Sgadari, Alessio La Bella, Marcello Farina
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach for the joint selection of model structure and parameter learning for nonlinear dynamical systems identification. Focusing on a specific Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) family, i.e., Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs Echo State Networks (NARXESNs), the method allows to simultaneously select the optimal model class and learn model parameters from data through a new set-membership (SM) based procedure. The results show the effectiveness of the approach in identifying parsimonious yet accurate models suitable for control applications. Moreover, the proposed framework enables a robust training strategy that explicitly accounts for bounded measurement noise and enhances model robustness by allowing data-consistent evaluation of simulation performance during parameter learning, a process generally NP-hard for models with autoregressive components.

Title: Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity: A Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Fetal Head Segmentation in Ultrasound
Authors: Fangyijie Wang, Siteng Ma, Guénolé Silvestre, Kathleen M. Curran
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound (US) data is often limited due to privacy and regulatory restrictions, posing challenges for training deep learning (DL) models. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) is commonly used for fetal US image analysis, existing SSL methods typically rely on random limited selection, which can lead to suboptimal model performance by overfitting to homogeneous labeled data. To address this, we propose a two-stage Active Learning (AL) sampler, Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity (EGAD), for fetal head segmentation. Our method first selects the most uncertain samples using predictive entropy, and then refines the final selection using the agreement-diversity score combining cosine similarity and mutual information. Additionally, our SSL framework employs a consistency learning strategy with feature downsampling to further enhance segmentation performance. In experiments, SSL-EGAD achieves an average Dice score of 94.57\% and 96.32\% on two public datasets for fetal head segmentation, using 5\% and 10\% labeled data for training, respectively. Our method outperforms current SSL models and showcases consistent robustness across diverse pregnancy stage data. The code is available on \href{this https URL}{GitHub}.

Title: Robust Output Regulation of Uncertain Linear Time-Varying Systems
Authors: Jinmeng Zha, Zhen Zhang
Abstract: Robust output regulation for linear time-varying systems has remained an open problem for decades. To address this, we propose intrinsic system immersion by reformulating the regulator equation in a more insightful form, indicating that finding an internal model is equivalent to reproducing the output trajectory of a forced system by constructing an unforced system. This perspective reveals the influence of parametric uncertainties, demonstrating that an infinite-dimensional controller is generally unavoidable for robustness against plant uncertainty. Consequently, a general robust design is proposed without explicitly solving the regulator equation. It ensures robustness against uncertainties in the exosystem interaction, and achieves approximate output regulation when an infinite-dimensional controller is necessary for regulation. Additionally, we study the regulator equation in a coordinate-free framework, extend the time-varying non-resonance condition, and provide a method to minimize the dimension of an internal model. Overall, these results provide a general systematic framework for constructing robust internal model-based controllers, and simplify the control implementation process.

Title: In-situ On-demand Digital Image Correlation: A New Data-rich Characterization Paradigm for Deformation and Damage Development in Solids
Authors: Ravi Venkata Surya Sai Mogilisetti, Partha Pratim Das, Rassel Raihan, Shiyao Lin
Abstract: Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms

Title: Spoofing-Aware Speaker Verification via Wavelet Prompt Tuning and Multi-Model Ensembles
Authors: Aref Farhadipour, Ming Jin, Valeriia Vyshnevetska, Xiyang Li, Elisa Pellegrino, Srikanth Madikeri
Abstract: This paper describes the UZH-CL system submitted to the SASV section of the WildSpoof 2026 challenge. The challenge focuses on the integrated defense against generative spoofing attacks by requiring the simultaneous verification of speaker identity and audio authenticity. We proposed a cascaded Spoofing-Aware Speaker Verification framework that integrates a Wavelet Prompt-Tuned XLSR-AASIST countermeasure with a multi-model ensemble. The ASV component utilizes the ResNet34, ResNet293, and WavLM-ECAPA-TDNN architectures, with Z-score normalization followed by score averaging. Trained on VoxCeleb2 and SpoofCeleb, the system obtained a Macro a-DCF of 0.2017 and a SASV EER of 2.08%. While the system achieved a 0.16% EER in spoof detection on the in-domain data, results on unseen datasets, such as the ASVspoof5, highlight the critical challenge of cross-domain generalization.

Title: Fast Multirate Encoding for 360° Video in OMAF Streaming Workflows
Authors: Amritha Premkumar, Christian Herglotz
Abstract: Preparing high-quality 360-degree video for HTTP Adaptive Streaming requires encoding each sequence into multiple representations spanning different resolutions and quantization parameters (QPs). For ultra-high-resolution immersive content such as 8K 360-degree video, this process is computationally intensive due to the large number of representations and the high complexity of modern codecs. This paper investigates fast multirate encoding strategies that reduce encoding time by reusing encoder analysis information across QPs and resolutions. We evaluate two cross-resolution information-reuse pipelines that differ in how reference encodes propagate across resolutions: (i) a strict HD -> 4K -> 8K cascade with scaled analysis reuse, and (ii) a resolution-anchored scheme that initializes each resolution with its own highest-bitrate reference before guiding dependent encodes. In addition to evaluating these pipelines on standard equirectangular projection content, we also apply the same two pipelines to cubemap-projection (CMP) tiling, where each 360-degree frame is partitioned into independently encoded tiles. CMP introduces substantial parallelism, while still benefiting from the proposed multirate analysis-reuse strategies. Experimental results using the SJTU 8K 360-degree dataset show that hierarchical analysis reuse significantly accelerates HEVC encoding with minimal rate-distortion impact across both equirectangular and CMP-tiled content, yielding encoding-time reductions of roughly 33%-59% for ERP and about 51% on average for CMP, with Bjontegaard Delta Encoding Time (BDET) gains approaching -50% and wall-clock speedups of up to 4.2x.

Title: ME-WARD: A multimodal ergonomic analysis tool for musculoskeletal risk assessment from inertial and video data in working plac
Authors: Javier González-Alonso, Paula Martín-Tapia, David González-Ortega, Míriam Antón-Rodríguez, Francisco Javier Díaz-Pernas, Mario Martínez-Zarzuela
Abstract: This study presents ME-WARD (Multimodal Ergonomic Workplace Assessment and Risk from Data), a novel system for ergonomic assessment and musculoskeletal risk evaluation that implements the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method. ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.

Title: Development of an end-to-end hardware and software pipeline for affordable and feasible ergonomics assessment in the automotive industry
Authors: Javier González-Alonso, Cristina Simón-Martínez, Míriam Antón-Rodríguez, David González-Ortega, Francisco Javier Díaz-Pernas, Mario Martínez-Zarzuela
Abstract: An end-to-end hardware-software pipeline is introduced to automatize ergonomics assessment in industrial workplaces. The proposed modular solution can interoperate with commercial systems throughout the ergonomics assessment phases involved in the process. The pipeline includes custom-designed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, two real-time worker movement acquisition tools, inverse kinematics processing and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) report generation. It is based on free tools such as Unity3D and OpenSim to avoid the problems derived from using proprietary technologies, such as security decisions being made under "black box" conditions. Experiments were conducted in an automotive factory in a workplace with WMSDs risk among workers. The proposed solution obtained comparable results to a gold standard solution, reaching measured joint angles a 0.95 cross-correlation and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 10 for elbows and 12 for shoulders between both systems. In addition, the global RULA score difference is lower than 5% between both systems. This work provides a low-cost solution for WMSDs risk assessment in the workplace to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and associated sick leave in industry, impacting the health of workers in the long term. Our study can ease further research and popularize the use of wearable systems for ergonomics analysis allowing these workplace prevention systems to reach different industrial environments.

Title: ToS: A Team of Specialists ensemble framework for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with distance estimation in Video
Authors: Davide Berghi, Philip J. B. Jackson
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection with distance estimation (3D SELD) in video involves identifying active sound events at each time frame while estimating their spatial coordinates. This multimodal task requires joint reasoning across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions, a challenge that single models often struggle to address effectively. To tackle this, we introduce the Team of Specialists (ToS) ensemble framework, which integrates three complementary sub-networks: a spatio-linguistic model, a spatio-temporal model, and a tempo-linguistic model. Each sub-network specializes in a unique pair of dimensions, contributing distinct insights to the final prediction, akin to a collaborative team with diverse expertise. ToS has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art audio-visual models for 3D SELD on the DCASE2025 Task 3 Stereo SELD development set, consistently outperforming existing methods across key metrics. Future work will extend this proof of concept by strengthening the specialists with appropriate tasks, training, and pre-training curricula.

Title: End-to-End Joint ASR and Speaker Role Diarization with Child-Adult Interactions
Authors: Anfeng Xu, Tiantian Feng, Somer Bishop, Catherine Lord, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: Accurate transcription and speaker diarization of child-adult spoken interactions are crucial for developmental and clinical research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and challenging to scale. Existing automated systems typically rely on cascaded speaker diarization and speech recognition pipelines, which can lead to error propagation. This paper presents a unified end-to-end framework that extends the Whisper encoder-decoder architecture to jointly model ASR and child-adult speaker role diarization. The proposed approach integrates: (i) a serialized output training scheme that emits speaker tags and start/end timestamps, (ii) a lightweight frame-level diarization head that enhances speaker-discriminative encoder representations, (iii) diarization-guided silence suppression for improved temporal precision, and (iv) a state-machine-based forced decoding procedure that guarantees structurally valid outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on two datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over two cascaded baselines, achieving lower multi-talker word error rates and demonstrating competitive diarization accuracy across both Whisper-small and Whisper-large models. These findings highlight the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed joint modeling framework for generating reliable, speaker-attributed transcripts of child-adult interactions at scale. The code and model weights are publicly available

Title: Battery-Free and Gateway-Free Cellular IoT Water Leak Detection System
Authors: Roshan Nepal, Brandon Brown, Shishangbo Yu, Roozbeh Abbasi, Norman Zhou, George Shaker
Abstract: This paper presents a battery-free and gateway-free water leak detection system capable of direct communication over LTE-M (Cat-M1). The system operates solely on energy harvested through a hydroelectric mechanism driven by an electrochemical sensor, thereby removing the need for conventional batteries. To address the stringent startup and operational power demands of LTE-M transceivers, the architecture incorporates a compartmentalized sensing module and a dedicated power management subsystem, comprising a boost converter, supercapacitor based energy storage, and a hysteresis controlled load isolation circuit. This design enables autonomous, direct to cloud data transmission without reliance on local networking infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate consistent LTE-M beacon transmissions triggered by water induced energy generation, underscoring the system's potential for sustainable, maintenance free, and globally scalable IoT leak detection applications in smart infrastructure.

Title: Battery-less Long-Range LTE-M Water Leak Detector
Authors: Roshan Nepal, Brandon Brown, Shishangbo Yu, Roozbeh Abbasi, Norman Zhou, George Shaker
Abstract: This work presents a self powered water leak sensor that eliminates both batteries and local gateways. The design integrates a dual compartment electrochemical harvester, a low input boost converter with supercapacitor storage, and a comparator gated LTE-M radio built on the Nordic Thingy:91 platform. Laboratory tests confirm that the system can be awakened from a dormant state in the presence of water, harvest sufficient energy, and issue repeated cloud beacons using the water exposure as the power source. Beyond conventional LTE-M deployments, the system's compatibility with 3GPP standard cellular protocols paves the way for future connectivity via non terrestrial 5G networks, enabling coverage in infrastructure scarce regions.

Title: Composite Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Systems with Parametric Uncertainty
Authors: Mohammadreza Kamaldar
Abstract: Control barrier functions guarantee safety but typically require accurate system models. Parametric uncertainty invalidates these guarantees. Existing robust methods maintain safety via worst-case bounds, limiting performance, while modular learning schemes decouple estimation from safety, permitting state violations during training. This paper presents the composite adaptive control barrier function (CaCBF) algorithm for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to linear parametric uncertainty. We derive adaptation laws from a composite energy function comprising a logarithmic safety barrier, a control Lyapunov function, and a parameter error term. We prove that CaCBF guarantees the forward invariance of the safe set and the uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system. This safety guarantee holds without requiring parameter convergence. Simulations of adaptive cruise control, an omnidirectional robot, and a planar drone demonstrate the efficacy of the CaCBF algorithm.

Title: Reliable Quasi-Static Post-Fall Floor-Occupancy Detection Using Low-Cost Millimetre-Wave Radar
Authors: Huy Trinh, Phuong Thai, Elliot Creager, George Shaker
Abstract: As the population ages rapidly, long-term care (LTC) facilities across North America face growing pressure to monitor residents safely while keeping staff workload manageable. Falls are among the most critical events to monitor due to their timely response requirement, yet frequent false alarms or uncertain detections can overwhelm caregivers and contribute to alarm fatigue. This motivates the design of reliable, whole end-to-end ambient monitoring systems from occupancy and activity awareness to fall and post-fall detection. In this paper, we focus on robust post-fall floor-occupancy detection using an off-the-shelf 60 GHz FMCW radar and evaluate its deployment in a realistic, furnished indoor environment representative of LTC facilities. Post-fall detection is challenging since motion is minimal, and reflections from the floor and surrounding objects can dominate the radar signal return. We compare a vendor-provided digital beamforming (DBF) pipeline against a proposed preprocessing approach based on Capon or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector is applied and evaluated on the resulting range-azimuth maps across 7 participants. The proposed method improves the mean frame-positive rate from 0.823 (DBF) to 0.916 (Proposed).

Title: Doppler-Domain Respiratory Amplification for Semi-Static Human Occupancy Detection Using Low-Resolution SIMO FMCW Radar
Authors: Huy Trinh, Elliot Creager, George Shaker
Abstract: Radar-based sensing is a promising privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and wearables in settings such as long-term care. Yet detecting quasi-static presence (lying, sitting, or standing with only subtle micro-motions) is difficult for low-resolution SIMO FMCW radar because near-zero Doppler energy is often buried under static clutter. We present Respiratory-Amplification Semi-Static Occupancy (RASSO), an invertible Doppler-domain non-linear remapping that densifies the slow-time FFT (Doppler) grid around 0 m/s before adaptive Capon beamforming. The resulting range-azimuth (RA) maps exhibit higher effective SNR, sharper target peaks, and lower background variance, making thresholding and learning more reliable. On a real nursing-home dataset collected with a short-range 1Tx-3Rx radar, RASSO-RA improves classical detection performance, achieving AUC = 0.981 and recall = 0.920/0.947 at FAR = 1%/5%, outperforming conventional Capon processing and a recent baseline. RASSO-RA also benefits data-driven models: a frame-based CNN reaches 95-99% accuracy and a sequence-based CNN-LSTM reaches 99.4-99.6% accuracy across subjects. A paired session-level bootstrap test confirms statistically significant macro-F1 gains of 2.6-3.6 points (95% confidence intervals above zero) over the non-warped pipeline. These results show that simple Doppler-domain warping before spatial processing can materially improve semi-static occupancy detection with low-resolution radar in real clinical environments.

Title: S-MDMA: Sensitivity-Aware Model Division Multiple Access for Satellite-Ground Semantic Communication
Authors: Hui Cao, Rui Meng, Shujun Han, Song Gao, Xiaodong Xu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to play a pivotal role in convergence of communication and AI (ComAI), particularly in enabling intelligent and efficient multi-user data transmission. However, the inherent bandwidth constraints and user interference in satellite-ground systems pose significant challenges to semantic fidelity and transmission robustness. To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-aware model division multiple access (S-MDMA) framework tailored for bandwidth-limited multi-user scenarios. The proposed framework first performs semantic extraction and merging based on the MDMA architecture to consolidate redundant information. To further improve transmission efficiency, a semantic sensitivity sorting algorithm is presented, which can selectively retain key semantic features. In addition, to mitigate inter-user interference, the framework incorporates orthogonal embedding of semantic features and introduces a multi-user reconstruction loss function to guide joint optimization. Experimental results on open-source datasets demonstrate that S-MDMA consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving robust and high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and user configurations.

Title: Over-The-Air Extreme Learning Machines with XL Reception via Nonlinear Cascaded Metasurfaces
Authors: Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, Mattia Fabiani, Giulia Torcolacci, Davide Dardari, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: The recently envisioned goal-oriented communications paradigm calls for the application of inference on wirelessly transferred data via Machine Learning (ML) tools. An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.

Title: Ampli-Flection for 6G: Active-RIS-Aided Aerial Backhaul with Full 3D Coverage
Authors: Hong-Bae Jeon, Chan-Byoung Chae
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel aerial backhaul architecture that employs an aerial active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve energy-efficient, {full 3D coverage including UAV-BSs and ground users in 6G wireless networks}. Unlike prior aerial-RIS approaches limited to {2D coverage with only servicing ground users} or passive operation, the proposed design integrates an active-RIS onto a high-altitude aerial platform, enabling reliable line-of-sight links and overcoming multiplicative fading through amplification. In a scenario with UAV-BSs deployed to handle sudden traffic surges in urban areas, the aerial-active-RIS both reflects and amplifies backhaul signals to overcome blockage. We jointly optimize the aerial platform placement, array partitioning, and RIS phase configuration to maximize UAV-BS energy-efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential to deliver resilient backhaul connectivity with comprehensive 3D coverage in 6G networks.

Title: A Capsule-Sized Multi-Wavelength Wireless Optical System for Edge-AI-Based Classification of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Flow Rate
Authors: Yunhao Bian, Dawei Wang, Mingyang Shen, Xinze Li, Jiayi Shi, Ziyao Zhou, Tiancheng Cao, Hen-Wei Huang
Abstract: Post-endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) rebleeding frequently occurs within the first 72 hours after therapeutic hemostasis and remains a major cause of early morbidity and mortality. Existing non-invasive monitoring approaches primarily provide binary blood detection and lack quantitative assessment of bleeding severity or flow dynamic, limiting their ability to support timely clinical decision-making during this high-risk period. In this work, we developed a capsule-sized, multi-wavelength optical sensing wireless platform for order-of-magnitude-level classification of GI bleeding flow rate, leveraging transmission spectroscopy and low-power edge artificial intelligence. The system performs time-resolved, multi-spectral measurements and employs a lightweight two-dimensional convolutional neural network for on-device flow-rate classification, with physics-based validation confirming consistency with wavelength-dependent hemoglobin absorption behavior. In controlled in vitro experiments under simulated gastric conditions, the proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.75% across multiple bleeding flow-rate levels while robustly distinguishing diverse non-blood gastrointestinal interference. By performing embedded inference directly on the capsule electronics, the system reduced overall energy consumption by approximately 88% compared with continuous wireless transmission of raw data, making prolonged, battery-powered operation feasible. Extending capsule-based diagnostics beyond binary blood detection toward continuous, site-specific assessment of bleeding severity, this platform has the potential to support earlier identification of clinically significant rebleeding and inform timely re-intervention during post-endoscopic surveillance.

Title: Context-Aware Iterative Token Detection and Masked Transmission for Wireless Token Communication
Authors: Junyong Shin, Joohyuk Park, Jihong Park, Jinho Choi, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: The success of large-scale language models has established tokens as compact and meaningful units for natural-language representation, which motivates token communication over wireless channels, where tokens are considered fundamental units for wireless transmission. We propose a context-aware token communication framework that uses a pretrained masked language model (MLM) as a shared contextual probability model between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). At Rx, we develop an iterative token detection method that jointly exploits MLM-guided contextual priors and channel observations based on a Bayesian perspective. At Tx, we additionally introduce a context-aware masking strategy which skips highly predictable token transmission to reduce transmission rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves reconstructed sentence quality and supports effective rate adaptation under various channel conditions.

Title: Movable Antenna-Enhanced Near-Field Flexible Beamforming: Performance Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Shun Yang, Xin Wei, Nianbing Su, Weidong Mei, Zhi Chen, Boyu Ning
Abstract: As an emerging wireless communication technology, movable antennas (MAs) offer the ability to adjust the spatial correlation of steering vectors, enabling more flexible beamforming compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs for two typical near-field beamforming scenarios: beam nulling and multi-beam forming. In the first scenario, we aim to jointly optimize the positions of multiple MAs and the beamforming vector to maximize the beam gain toward a desired direction while nulling interference toward multiple undesired directions. In the second scenario, the objective is to maximize the minimum beam gain among all the above directions. However, both problems are non-convex and challenging to solve optimally. To gain insights, we first analyze several special cases and show that, with proper positioning of the MAs, directing the beam toward a specific direction can lead to nulls or full gains in other directions in the two scenarios, respectively. For the general cases, we propose a discrete sampling method and an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions to the two formulated problems. Furthermore, considering the practical limitations in antenna positioning accuracy, we analyze the impact of position errors on the performance of the optimized beamforming and MA positions, by introducing a Taylor series approximation for the near-field beam gain at each target. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Title: Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Networks: The BER vs. Residual Delay and Doppler Analysis
Authors: Chao Zhang, Kunlun Li, Chao Xu, Lie-Liang Yang, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Perfect Doppler compensation and synchronization is nontrivial due to multi-path Doppler effects and Einstein's theory of relativity in the space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGINs). Hence, by considering the residual Doppler and the synchronization delay, this paper investigates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance attained under time-varying correlated Shadowed-Rician SAGIN channels. First, a practical SAGIN model is harnessed, encompassing correlated Shadowed-Rician channels, the Snell's law-based path loss, atmospheric absorption, the line-of-sight Doppler compensation, elliptical satellite orbits, and Einstein's theory of relativity. Then, a specific correlation coefficient between the pilot and data symbols is derived in the context of correlated Shadowed-Rician Channels. By exploiting this correlation coefficient, the channel distribution is mimicked by a bi-variate Gamma distribution. Then, a closed-form BER formula is derived under employing least-square channel estimation and equalization for 16-QAM. Our analytical results indicate for a 300-km-altitude LEO that 1) the period of realistic elliptical orbits is around 0.8 seconds longer than that of the idealized circular orbits; and 2) the relativistic delay is lower than 1 $\mu s$ over a full LEO pass (from rise to set). Our numerical results for the L bands quantify the effects of: 1) the residual Doppler; 2) atmospheric shadowing; 3) synchronization errors; and 4) pilot overhead.

Title: A Physics-Informed Digital Twin Framework for Calibrated Sim-to-Real FMCW Radar Occupancy Estimation
Authors: Huy Trinh, Sebastian Ratto V, Elliot Creager, George Shaker
Abstract: Learning robust radar perception models directly from real measurements is costly due to the need for controlled experiments, repeated calibration, and extensive annotation. This paper proposes a lightweight simulation-to-real (sim2real) framework that enables reliable Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar occupancy detection and people counting using only a physics-informed geometric simulator and a small unlabeled real calibration set. We introduce calibrated domain randomization (CDR) to align the global noise-floor statistics of simulated range-Doppler (RD) maps with those observed in real environments while preserving discriminative micro-Doppler structure. Across real-world evaluations, ResNet18 models trained purely on CDR-adjusted simulation achieve 97 percent accuracy for occupancy detection and 72 percent accuracy for people counting, outperforming ray-tracing baseline simulation and conventional random domain randomization baselines.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays a pivotal role in understanding human communication, enabling emotionally intelligent systems, and serving as a fundamental component in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, deploying SER in real-world, spontaneous, and low-resource scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of emotional expression and the limitations of current speech and language technologies. This thesis investigates the integration of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into SER, with the goal of enhancing the robustness, scalability, and practical applicability of emotion recognition from spoken language.

Title: Photovoltaic energy sharing: Implementation and tests on a real collective self-consumption system
Authors: Camblong H., Curea O., Ugartemendia J.J., Boussaada Z., Lizarralde I., Etxegarai G
Abstract: This research study analyses different types of photovoltaic (PV) energy sharing in a collective self-consumption (CSC) real-case in the Izarbel technological park in France. The analysis is carried out above all from the point of view of the self-consumption rate (SCR) and the savings. After explaining the emergence of the self-consumption concept for the integration of renewable energies, the study case is described. The PV energy is produced in ESTIA1 building and consumed in ESTIA1, 2 and 4 buildings. The main IoT components used to implement the CSC are smart meters and the Tecsol TICs; devices based on the LoRa protocol to retrieve production and consumption data. Then, the characteristics of PV energy sharing in France are explained, in particular the three possible types of energy sharing/allocation (static, dynamic by default and customised dynamic) and the structure of the electricity bill. Finally, the three types of sharing are compared in four scenarios (without and with a data centre, for low and high solar radiation). The results show that the dynamic allocations lead to increases of the SCR and that the customised dynamic sharing increases savings.

Title: Data-driven nonparametric Li-ion battery ageing model aiming at learning from real operation data -- Part A: Storage operation
Authors: Lucu M., Martinez-Laserna E., Gandiaga I., Liu K., Camblong H., Widanage W.D., Marco J
Abstract: Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing. In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model. This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.

Title: AmbER$^2$: Dual Ambiguity-Aware Emotion Recognition Applied to Speech and Text
Authors: Jingyao Wu, Grace Lin, Yinuo Song, Rosalind Picard
Abstract: Emotion recognition is inherently ambiguous, with uncertainty arising both from rater disagreement and from discrepancies across modalities such as speech and text. There is growing interest in modeling rater ambiguity using label distributions. However, modality ambiguity remains underexplored, and multimodal approaches often rely on simple feature fusion without explicitly addressing conflicts between modalities. In this work, we propose AmbER$^2$, a dual ambiguity-aware framework that simultaneously models rater-level and modality-level ambiguity through a teacher-student architecture with a distribution-wise training objective. Evaluations on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that AmbER$^2$ consistently improves distributional fidelity over conventional cross-entropy baselines and achieves performance competitive with, or superior to, recent state-of-the-art systems. For example, on IEMOCAP, AmbER$^2$ achieves relative improvements of 20.3% on Bhattacharyya coefficient (0.83 vs. 0.69), 13.6% on R$^2$ (0.67 vs. 0.59), 3.8% on accuracy (0.683 vs. 0.658), and 4.5% on F1 (0.675 vs. 0.646). Further analysis across ambiguity levels shows that explicitly modeling ambiguity is particularly beneficial for highly uncertain samples. These findings highlight the importance of jointly addressing rater and modality ambiguity when building robust emotion recognition systems.

Title: Dominant Sets Based Band Selection in Hyperspectral Imagery
Authors: Onur Haliloğlu, Ufuk Sakarya, B. Uğur Töreyin, Orhan Gazi
Abstract: Hyperspectral imagery is composed of huge amount of data which creates significant transmission latencies for communication systems. It is vital to decrease the huge data size before transmitting the Hyperspectral imagery. Besides, large data size leads to processing problems, especially in practical applications. Moreover, due to the lack of sufficient training samples, Hughes phenomena occur with huge amount of data. Feature selection can be used in order to get rid of huge data problems. In this paper, a band selection framework is introduced to reduce the data size and to find out the most proper spectral bands for a specific application. The method is based on finding "dominant sets" in hyperspectral data, so that spectral bands are clustered. From each cluster, the band that reflects the cluster behavior the most is selected to form the most valuable band set in the spectra for a specific application. The proposed feature selection method has low computational complexity since it performs on a small size of data when realizing the feature selection. The aim of the study is to find out a general framework that can define required bands for classification without requiring to perform on the whole data set. Results on Pavia and Salinas datasets show that the proposed framework performs better than the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of classification accuracy.

Title: SpatialEmb: Extract and Encode Spatial Information for 1-Stage Multi-channel Multi-speaker ASR on Arbitrary Microphone Arrays
Authors: Yiwen Shao, Yong Xu, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Dong Yu
Abstract: Spatial information is a critical clue for multi-channel multi-speaker target speech recognition. Most state-of-the-art multi-channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems extract spatial features only during the speech separation stage, followed by standard single-channel ASR on the separated speech. This approach results in an inefficient, lengthy pipeline and sub-optimal ASR performance due to the accumulated errors from preprocessing modules. Furthermore, most spatial feature extraction methods depend on the knowledge of speaker positions and microphone topology, making the systems reliant on specific settings and challenging to adapt to new equipment. In this work, we propose a solution to these issues with a lightweight embedding module named SpatialEmb, which extracts and encodes spatial information directly for the ASR model, supporting both fixed and arbitrary microphone topology. We conduct comprehensive experiments on AliMeeting, a real meeting corpus, to determine the optimal model design for SpatialEmb in terms of both performance and efficiency. Our best model trained with 105 hours Train-Ali-far achieves 17.04% and 20.32% character error rates (CER) on the Eval and Test sets, establishing a new state-of-the-art result with the same training data.

Title: OneVoice: One Model, Triple Scenarios-Towards Unified Zero-shot Voice Conversion
Authors: Zhichao Wang, Tao Li, Wenshuo Ge, Zihao Cui, Shilei Zhang, Junlan Feng
Abstract: Recent progress of voice conversion~(VC) has achieved a new milestone in speaker cloning and linguistic preservation. But the field remains fragmented, relying on specialized models for linguistic-preserving, expressive, and singing scenarios. We propose OneVoice, a unified zero-shot framework capable of handling all three scenarios within a single model. OneVoice is built upon a continuous language model trained with VAE-free next-patch diffusion, ensuring high fidelity and efficient sequence modeling. Its core design for unification lies in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designed to explicitly model shared conversion knowledge and scenario-specific expressivity. Expert selection is coordinated by a dual-path routing mechanism, including shared expert isolation and scenario-aware domain expert assignment with global-local cues. For precise conditioning, scenario-specific prosodic features are fused into each layer via a gated mechanism, allowing adaptive usage of prosody information. Furthermore, to enable the core idea and alleviate the imbalanced issue (abundant speech vs. scarce singing), we adopt a two-stage progressive training that includes foundational pre-training and scenario enhancement with LoRA-based domain experts. Experiments show that OneVoice matches or surpasses specialized models across all three scenarios, while verifying flexible control over scenarios and offering a fast decoding version as few as 2 steps. Code and model will be released soon.

Title: Efficient Rehearsal for Continual Learning in ASR via Singular Value Tuning
Authors: Steven Vander Eeckt, Hugo Van hamme
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) suffers from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks, domains, or speakers. A common strategy to mitigate this is to store a subset of past data in memory for rehearsal. However, rehearsal-based methods face key limitations: storing data is often costly, infeasible with pre-trained models, or restricted by privacy regulations. Running existing rehearsal-based methods with smaller memory sizes to alleviate these issues usually leads to degraded performance. We propose a rehearsal-based CL method that remains effective even with minimal memory. It operates in two stages: first, fine-tuning on the new task; second, applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the changes in linear layers and, in a parameter-efficient manner, retraining only gating vectors on the singular values, which control to extent to which updates from the first stage are accepted, using rehearsal. We extensively test and analyze our method on two monolingual and two multilingual benchmarks. Our method reduces forgetting and outperforms state-of-the-art CL approaches for ASR, even when limited to a single utterance per previous task.

Title: Validation of a Software-Defined 100-Gb/s RDMA Streaming Architecture for Ultrafast Optoacoustic and Ultrasound Imaging
Authors: Federico Villani, Christian Vogt, Luca Specht, Jero Schmid, Xiang Liu, Andrea Cossettini, Daniel Razansky, Luca Benini
Abstract: Optoacoustic (OA) imaging has emerged as a powerful investigation tool, with demonstrated applicability in oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular biology. However, its clinical translation is limited with the existing OA systems, which often rely on bulky and expensive acquisition hardware mainly optimized for pulse-echo ultrasound (US) imaging. Despite the fact that OA imaging has different requirements for receive bandwidths and timing synchronization with external laser sources, there is a strong need for unified OA-US imaging platforms, as pulse-echo US remains the standard tool for visualizing soft tissues. To address these challenges, we propose a new data acquisition architecture for ultrafast OA and US imaging that fully covers the requirements for large channel counts, wide bandwidth, and software-defined operation. LtL combines state-of-the-art wideband analog front-ends, a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC integrating FPGA fabric with an Application Processing Unit, and a 100 GbE Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) backend enabling raw-data streaming at up to 95.6 Gb/s. The architecture avoids local buffers followed by burst transfers, which commonly constrain sustainable frame rate and recording intervals, thus achieving true continuous and sustained streaming of raw data. We validate the core elements of the LtL architecture using a 16-channel demonstration system built from commercial evaluation boards. We further verify the signal chain for up to 256-channel scalability, confirming the wide bandwidth capabilities to support state-of-the-art data transmission speeds.

Title: Reinforcement Learning with Distributed MPC for Fuel-Efficient Platoon Control with Discrete Gear Transitions
Authors: Samuel Mallick, Gianpietro Battocletti, Dimitris Boskos, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: Cooperative control of groups of autonomous vehicles (AVs), i.e., platoons, is a promising direction to improving the efficiency of autonomous transportation systems. In this context, distributed co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position can offer benefits for fuel-efficient driving. To this end, model predictive control (MPC) is a popular approach, optimizing the speed and gear-shift schedule while explicitly considering the vehicles' dynamics over a prediction window. However, optimization over both the vehicles' continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions is computationally intensive, and may require overly long sample times or high-end hardware for real-time implementation. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distributed MPC approach to address this issue. For each vehicle in the platoon, a policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction window of a local MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved as part of a distributed MPC scheme. In order to reduce the computational cost of training and facilitate the scalability of the proposed approach to large platoons, the policies are parameterized such that the emergent multi-agent RL problem can be decoupled into single-agent learning tasks. In addition, a recurrent neural-network (RNN) architecture is proposed for the gear selection policy, such that the learning is scalable even as the number of possible gear-shift schedules grows exponentially with the MPC prediction horizon. In highway-driving simulations, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance in terms of fuel-efficient platoon control, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.

Title: Noise-Robust Contrastive Learning with an MFCC-Conformer For Coronary Artery Disease Detection
Authors: Milan Marocchi, Matthew Fynn, Yue Rong
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide, with coronary artery disease (CAD) comprising the largest subcategory of CVDs. Recently, there has been increased focus on detecting CAD using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, with high success in clinical environments with low noise and optimal sensor placement. Multichannel techniques have been found to be more robust to noise; however, achieving robust performance on real-world data remains a challenge. This work utilises a novel multichannel energy-based noisy-segment rejection algorithm, using heart and noise-reference microphones, to discard audio segments with large amounts of nonstationary noise before training a deep learning classifier. This conformer-based classifier takes mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from multiple channels, further helping improve the model's noise robustness. The proposed method achieved 78.4% accuracy and 78.2% balanced accuracy on 297 subjects, representing improvements of 4.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to training without noisy-segment rejection.

Title: Convex Chance-Constrained Stochastic Control under Uncertain Specifications with Application to Learning-Based Hybrid Powertrain Control
Authors: Teruki Kato, Ryotaro Shima, Kenji Kashima
Abstract: This paper presents a strictly convex chance-constrained stochastic control framework that accounts for uncertainty in control specifications such as reference trajectories and operational constraints. By jointly optimizing control inputs and risk allocation under general (possibly non-Gaussian) uncertainties, the proposed method guarantees probabilistic constraint satisfaction while ensuring strict convexity, leading to uniqueness and continuity of the optimal solution. The formulation is further extended to nonlinear model-based control using exactly linearizable models identified through machine learning. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through model predictive control applied to a hybrid powertrain system.

Title: Residual Learning for Neural Ambisonics Encoders
Authors: Thomas Deppisch, Yang Gao, Manan Mittal, Benjamin Stahl, Christoph Hold, David Alon, Zamir Ben-Hur
Abstract: Emerging wearable devices such as smartglasses and extended reality headsets demand high-quality spatial audio capture from compact, head-worn microphone arrays. Ambisonics provides a device-agnostic spatial audio representation by mapping array signals to spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. In practice, however, accurate encoding remains challenging. While traditional linear encoders are signal-independent and robust, they amplify low-frequency noise and suffer from high-frequency spatial aliasing. On the other hand, neural network approaches can outperform linear encoders but they often assume idealized microphones and may perform inconsistently in real-world scenarios. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce a residual-learning framework that refines a linear encoder with corrections from a neural network. Using measured array transfer functions from smartglasses, we compare a UNet-based encoder from the literature with a new recurrent attention model. Our analysis reveals that both neural encoders only consistently outperform the linear baseline when integrated within the residual learning framework. In the residual configuration, both neural models achieve consistent and significant improvements across all tested metrics for in-domain data and moderate gains for out-of-domain data. Yet, coherence analysis indicates that all neural encoder configurations continue to struggle with directionally accurate high-frequency encoding.

Title: Integrated Channel Estimation and Sensing for Near-Field ELAA Systems
Authors: Jionghui Wang, Jun Fang, Hongbin Li, Boyu Ning
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of uplink channel estimation for near-filed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where a base station (BS), equipped with an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA), serves multiple users over the same time-frequency resource block. A non-orthogonal pilot transmission scheme is considered to accommodate a larger number of users that can be supported by ELAA systems without incurring an excessive amount of training overhead. To facilitate efficient multi-user channel estimation, we express the received signal as a third-order low-rank tensor, which admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios and a block term decomposition (BTD) model for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. An alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-linear least squares (NLS) algorithm are employed to perform CPD and BTD, respectively. Channel parameters are then efficiently extracted from the recovered factor matrices. By exploiting the geometry of the propagation paths in the estimated channel, users' positions can be precisely determined in LoS scenarios. Moreover, our uniqueness analysis shows that the proposed tensor-based joint multi-user channel estimation framework is effective even when the number of pilot symbols is much smaller than the number of users, revealing its potential in training overhead reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves markedly higher channel estimation accuracy than compressed sensing (CS)-based approaches.

Abstract: In audiovisual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) systems, information fusion of visual features in a pre-trained ASR has been proven as a promising method to improve noise robustness. In this work, based on the prominent Whisper ASR, first, we propose a simple and effective visual fusion method -- use of visual features both in encoder and decoder (dual-use) -- to learn the audiovisual interactions in the encoder and to weigh modalities in the decoder. Second, we compare visual fusion methods in Whisper models of various sizes. Our proposed dual-use method shows consistent noise robustness improvement, e.g., a 35% relative improvement (WER: 4.41% vs. 6.83%) based on Whisper small, and a 57% relative improvement (WER: 4.07% vs. 9.53%) based on Whisper medium, compared to typical reference middle fusion in babble noise with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0dB. Third, we conduct ablation studies examining the impact of various module designs and fusion options. Fine-tuned on 1929 hours of audiovisual data, our dual-use method using Whisper medium achieves 4.08% (MUSAN babble noise) and 4.43% (NoiseX babble noise) average WER across various SNRs, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art in noisy conditions on the LRS3 AV-ASR benchmark.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hybrid RIS Assisted MIMO Communications
Authors: Phuong Nam Tran, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Markku Juntti
Abstract: Hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRIS) enhance wireless systems by combining passive reflection with active signal amplification. However, jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming with the HRIS reflection and amplification coefficients to maximize spectral efficiency (SE) is a non-convex problem, and conventional iterative solutions are computationally intensive. To address this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns a direct mapping from channel state information to the near-optimal transmit beamforming and HRIS configurations. The DRL model is trained offline, after which it can compute the beamforming and HRIS configurations with low complexity and latency. Simulation results demonstrate that our DRL-based method achieves 95% of the SE obtained by the alternating optimization benchmark, while significantly lowering the computational complexity.

Title: Dynamic Channel Charting: An LSTM-AE-based Approach
Authors: Yuan Gao, Xinyu Guo, Wenjing Xie, Zifan Wang, Hongwen Yu, Gongyang Li, Shugong Xu
Abstract: With the development of the sixth-generation (6G) communication system, Channel State Information (CSI) plays a crucial role in improving network performance. Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability.

Title: Dualband OFDM Delay Estimation for Multi-Target Localization
Authors: Jialun Kou, Achiel Colpaert, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: Integrated localization and communication systems aim to reuse communication waveforms for simultaneous data transmission and localization, but delay resolution is fundamentally limited by the available bandwidth. In practice, large contiguous bandwidths are difficult to obtain due to hardware constraints and spectrum fragmentation. Aggregating non-contiguous narrow bands can increase the effective frequency span, but a non-contiguous frequency layout introduces challenges such as elevated sidelobes and ambiguity in delay estimation. This paper introduces a point-spread-function (PSF)-centric framework for dual-band OFDM delay estimation. We model the observed delay profile as the convolution of the true target response with a PSF determined by the dual-band subcarrier selection pattern, explicitly linking band configuration to resolution and ambiguity. To suppress PSF-induced artifacts, we adapt the RELAX algorithm for dual-band multi-target delay estimation. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy in dual-band scenarios, supporting ILC under fragmented spectrum.

Title: Real-Time Prediction of Lower Limb Joint Kinematics, Kinetics, and Ground Reaction Force using Wearable Sensors and Machine Learning
Authors: Josée Mallah, Yu Zhu, Kailang Xu, Gurvinder S. Virk, Shaoping Bai, Luigi G. Occhipinti
Abstract: Walking is a key movement of interest in biomechanics, yet gold-standard data collection methods are time- and cost-expensive. This paper presents a real-time, multimodal, high sample rate lower-limb motion capture framework, based on wireless wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. Random Forests are used to estimate joint angles from IMU data, and ground reaction force (GRF) is predicted from instrumented insoles, while joint moments are predicted from angles and GRF using deep learning based on the ResNet-16 architecture. All three models achieve good accuracy compared to literature, and the predictions are logged at 1 kHz with a minimal delay of 23 ms for 20s worth of input data. The present work fully relies on wearable sensors, covers all five major lower limb joints, and provides multimodal comprehensive estimations of GRF, joint angles, and moments with minimal delay suitable for biofeedback applications.

Title: Audio Inpainting in Time-Frequency Domain with Phase-Aware Prior
Authors: Peter Balušík, Pavel Rajmic
Abstract: The so-called audio inpainting problem in the time domain refers to estimating missing segments of samples within a signal. Over the years, several methods have been developed for such type of audio inpainting. In contrast to this case, a time-frequency variant of inpainting appeared in the literature, where the challenge is to reconstruct missing spectrogram columns with reliable information. We propose a method to address this time-frequency audio inpainting problem. Our approach is based on the recently introduced phase-aware signal prior that exploits an estimate of the instantaneous frequency. An optimization problem is formulated and solved using the generalized Chambolle-Pock algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated both objectively and subjectively against other time-frequency inpainting methods, specifically a deep-prior neural network and the autoregression-based approach known as Janssen-TF. Our proposed approach surpassed these methods in the objective evaluation as well as in the conducted listening test. Moreover, this outcome is achieved with a substantially reduced computational requirement compared to alternative methods.

Title: Hybrid Radar Fusion with Quantization: CRB-Rate Trade-offs and ADC Dynamic Range
Authors: Akhileswar Chowdary, Ahmad Bazzi, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: Recent advancements have underscored the relevance of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Nevertheless, their specific impact on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains largely unexplored. In HRF systems, where uplink (UL) paths carry direct and reflected signals in the same frequency band, the reflected signal is often significantly weaker, making HRF performance particularly sensitive to ADC resolution. To study this effect, we use the quantized Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) to measure sensing accuracy. This work derives an upper bound on the quantized CRB for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and explores CRB-rate trade-offs through two formulated optimization problems. Simulation results indicate that HRF becomes infeasible when the dynamic range of the received signal exceeds the dynamic range supported by the ADC, which is inherently limited by its resolution. Furthermore, the UL communication rate does not increase significantly when the ADC resolution is raised beyond a certain threshold. These observations highlight a fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication performance: while HRF performance benefits from higher ADC resolutions, the corresponding gains in communication rate plateau. This trade-off is effectively characterized using CRB-rate boundaries derived through simulation.

Title: Experimental Characterization of ISAC Channel Mapping and Environment Awareness
Authors: Zhuangzhuang Cui, Rizqi Hersyandika, Haoqiu Xiong, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: In the context of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), this paper presents an experimental investigation of the relationship between monostatic sensing and naturally bistatic communication channels in an indoor millimeter-wave environment. We characterize the propagation channel in the joint delay--angle domain, extract dominant multipath components (MPCs) and associate them with physical scatterers in the environment, and demonstrate how communication MPCs can be explicitly recovered from sensing channels. Finally, the radar cross-sections (RCSs) of two key scatterers, namely the wall and metal plate, are obtained based on calibrated channel power and reconstructed propagation distances.

Title: Synchronization and Localization in Ad-Hoc ICAS Networks Using a Two-Stage Kuramoto Method
Authors: Dominik Neudert-Schulz, Thomas Dallmann
Abstract: To enable Integrated Communications and Sensing (ICAS) in a peer-to-peer vehicular network, precise synchronization in frequency and phase among the communicating entities is required. In addition, self-driving cars need accurate position estimates of the surrounding vehicles. In this work, we propose a joint, distributed synchronization and localization scheme for a network of communicating entities. Our proposed scheme is mostly signal-agnostic and therefore can be applied to a wide range of possible ICAS signals. We also mitigate the effect of finite sampling frequencies, which otherwise would degrade the synchronization and localization performance severely.

Title: AI-Driven Fuzzing for Vulnerability Assessment of 5G Traffic Steering Algorithms
Authors: Seyed Bagher Hashemi Natanzi, Hossein Mohammadi, Bo Tang, Vuk Marojevic
Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.

Title: Learning to Discover: A Generalized Framework for Raga Identification without Forgetting
Authors: Parampreet Singh, Somya Kumar, Chaitanya Shailendra Nitawe, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Raga identification in Indian Art Music (IAM) remains challenging due to the presence of numerous rarely performed Ragas that are not represented in available training datasets. Traditional classification models struggle in this setting, as they assume a closed set of known categories and therefore fail to recognise or meaningfully group previously unseen Ragas. Recent works have tried categorizing unseen Ragas, but they run into a problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the knowledge of previously seen Ragas is diminished. To address this problem, we adopt a unified learning framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled audio, enabling the model to discover coherent categories corresponding to the unseen Ragas, while retaining the knowledge of previously known ones. We test our model on benchmark Raga Identification datasets and demonstrate its performance in categorizing previously seen, unseen, and all Raga classes. The proposed approach surpasses the previous NCD-based pipeline even in discovering the unseen Raga categories, offering new insights into representation learning for IAM tasks.

Title: Low-Bit Quantization of Bandlimited Graph Signals via Iterative Methods
Authors: Felix Krahmer, He Lyu, Rayan Saab, Jinna Qian, Anna Veselovska, Rongrong Wang
Abstract: We study the quantization of real-valued bandlimited signals on graphs, focusing on low-bit representations. We propose iterative noise-shaping algorithms for quantization, including sampling approaches with and without vertex replacement. The methods leverage the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian and exploit graph incoherence to achieve high-fidelity approximations. Theoretical guarantees are provided for the random sampling method, and extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed schemes.

Title: Online parameter estimation for the Crazyflie quadcopter through an EM algorithm
Authors: Yanhua Zhao
Abstract: Drones are becoming more and more popular nowadays. They are small in size, low in cost, and reliable in operation. They contain a variety of sensors and can perform a variety of flight tasks, reaching places that are difficult or inaccessible for humans. Earthquakes damage a lot of infrastructure, making it impossible for rescuers to reach some areas. But drones can help. Many amateur and professional photographers like to use drones for aerial photography. Drones play a non-negligible role in agriculture and transportation too. Drones can be used to spray pesticides, and they can also transport supplies. A quadcopter is a four-rotor drone and has been studied in this paper. In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented. The expectation maximization algorithm has been applied for parameter estimation of the quadcopter. The results of offline parameter estimation and online parameter estimation are presented. The results show that the online parameter estimation has a slightly larger range of convergence values than the offline parameter estimation.

Title: A Contrastive Pre-trained Foundation Model for Deciphering Imaging Noisomics across Modalities
Authors: Yuanjie Gu, Yiqun Wang, Chaohui Yu, Ang Xuan, Fan Wang, Zhi Lu, Biqin Dong
Abstract: Characterizing imaging noise is notoriously data-intensive and device-dependent, as modern sensors entangle physical signals with complex algorithmic artifacts. Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce "Noisomics", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy. By decoding noise as a multi-parametric footprint, our work redefines stochastic degradation as a vital information resource, empowering precise imaging diagnostics without prior device calibration.

Title: SonoEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Pronunciation Correction in LLM-Based TTS
Authors: Ayush Pratap Singh, Harshit Singh, Nityanand Mathur, Akshat Mandloi, Sudarshan Kamath
Abstract: Neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems systematically mispronounce low-resource proper nouns, particularly non-English names, brands, and geographic locations, due to their underrepresentation in predominantly English training corpora. Existing solutions typically rely on expensive multilingual data collection, supervised finetuning, or manual phonetic annotation, which limits the deployment of TTS systems in linguistically diverse settings. We introduce SonoEdit, a model editing technique that surgically corrects pronunciation errors in pre-trained TTS models without retraining. Instead of costly finetuning or explicit phoneme injection, we propose a parsimonious alternative based on Null-Space Pronunciation Editing, which performs a single-shot parameter update to modify the pronunciation of specific words while provably preserving all other model behavior. We first adapt Acoustic Causal Tracing to identify the Transformer layers responsible for text-to-pronunciation mapping. We then apply Null-Space Constrained Editing to compute a closed-form weight update that corrects the target pronunciation while remaining mathematically orthogonal to the subspace governing general speech generation. This constrained update steers the model's acoustic output toward a desired pronunciation exemplar while guaranteeing zero first-order change on a preserved speech corpus.

Title: Sink or SWIM: Tackling Real-Time ASR at Scale
Authors: Federico Bruzzone, Walter Cazzola, Matteo Brancaleoni, Dario Pellegrino
Abstract: Real-time automatic speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into interactive applications, from voice assistants to live transcription services. However, scaling these systems to support multiple concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and high accuracy remains a major challenge. In this work, we present SWIM, a novel real-time ASR system built on top of OpenAI's Whisper model that enables true model-level parallelization for scalable, multilingual transcription. SWIM supports multiple concurrent audio streams without modifying the underlying model. It introduces a buffer merging strategy that maintains transcription fidelity while ensuring efficient resource usage. We evaluate SWIM in multi-client settings -- scaling up to 20 concurrent users -- and show that it delivers accurate real-time transcriptions in English, Italian, and Spanish, while maintaining low latency and high throughput. While Whisper-Streaming achieves a word error rate of approximately 8.2% with an average delay of approximately 3.4 s in a single-client, English-only setting, SWIM extends this capability to multilingual, multi-client environments. It maintains comparable accuracy with significantly lower delay -- around 2.4 s with 5 clients -- and continues to scale effectively up to 20 concurrent clients without degrading transcription quality and increasing overall throughput. Our approach advances scalable ASR by improving robustness and efficiency in dynamic, multi-user environments.

Title: MambaNet: Mamba-assisted Channel Estimation Neural Network With Attention Mechanism
Authors: Dianxin Luan, Chengsi Liang, Jie Huang, Zheng Lin, Kaitao Meng, John Thompson, Cheng-Xiang Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes a Mamba-assisted neural network framework incorporating self-attention mechanism to achieve improved channel estimation with low complexity for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, particularly for configurations with a large number of subcarriers. With the integration of customized Mamba architecture, the proposed framework handles large-scale subcarrier channel estimation efficiently while capturing long-distance dependencies among these subcarriers effectively. Unlike conventional Mamba structure, this paper implements a bidirectional selective scan to improve channel estimation performance, because channel gains at different subcarriers are non-causal. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits relatively lower space complexity than transformer-based neural networks. Simulation results tested on the 3GPP TS 36.101 channel demonstrate that compared to other baseline neural network solutions, the proposed method achieves improved channel estimation performance with a reduced number of tunable parameters.

Title: Spatiotemporal Semantic V2X Framework for Cooperative Collision Prediction
Authors: Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Aisha Syed, Matthew Andrews, Sean Kennedy
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.

Title: Unsupervised clustering algorithm for efficient processing of 4D-STEM and 5D-STEM data
Authors: Serin Lee, Stephanie M. Ribet, Arthur R. C. McCray, Andrew Barnum, Jennifer A. Dionne, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) enables mapping of diffraction information with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, offering detailed insight into local structure, orientation, and strain. However, as data dimensionality and sampling density increase, particularly for in situ scanning diffraction experiments (5D-STEM), robust segmentation of spatially coherent regions becomes essential for efficient and physically meaningful analysis. Here, we introduce a clustering framework that identifies crystallographically distinct domains from 4D-STEM datasets. By using local diffraction-pattern similarity as a metric, the method extracts closed contours delineating regions of coherent structural behavior. This approach produces cluster-averaged diffraction patterns that improve signal-to-noise and reduce data volume by orders of magnitude, enabling rapid and accurate orientation, phase, and strain mapping. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to in situ liquid-cell 4D-STEM data of gold nanoparticle growth. Our method provides a scalable and generalizable route for spatially coherent segmentation, data compression, and quantitative structure-strain mapping across diverse 4D-STEM modalities. The full analysis code and example workflows are publicly available to support reproducibility and reuse.

Authors: Max McKinnon, Samir Khaki, Chandan KA Reddy, William Huang
Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) plays a vital role in enabling applications such as speech recognition. We analyze the impact of window size on the accuracy of three VAD algorithms: Silero, WebRTC, and Root Mean Square (RMS) across a set of diverse real-world digital audio streams. We additionally explore the use of hysteresis on top of each VAD output. Our results offer practical references for optimizing VAD systems. Silero significantly outperforms WebRTC and RMS, and hysteresis provides a benefit for WebRTC.

Title: SPADE: A SIMD Posit-enabled compute engine for Accelerating DNN Efficiency
Authors: Sonu Kumar, Lavanya Vinnakota, Mukul Lokhande, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma, Adam Teman
Abstract: The growing demand for edge-AI systems requires arithmetic units that balance numerical precision, energy efficiency, and compact hardware while supporting diverse formats. Posit arithmetic offers advantages over floating- and fixed-point representations through its tapered precision, wide dynamic range, and improved numerical robustness. This work presents SPADE, a unified multi-precision SIMD Posit-based multiplyaccumulate (MAC) architecture supporting Posit (8,0), Posit (16,1), and Posit (32,2) within a single framework. Unlike prior single-precision or floating/fixed-point SIMD MACs, SPADE introduces a regime-aware, lane-fused SIMD Posit datapath that hierarchically reuses Posit-specific submodules (LOD, complementor, shifter, and multiplier) across 8/16/32-bit precisions without datapath replication. FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-7 shows 45.13% LUT and 80% slice reduction for Posit (8,0), and up to 28.44% and 17.47% improvement for Posit (16,1) and Posit (32,2) over prior work, with only 6.9% LUT and 14.9% register overhead for multi-precision support. ASIC results across TSMC nodes achieve 1.38 GHz at 6.1 mW (28 nm). Evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and alphabet datasets confirms competitive inference accuracy.

Title: Joint Uplink-Downlink Fronthaul Bit Allocation in Fronthaul-Limited Massive MU-MIMO Systems
Authors: Yasaman Khorsandmanesh, Emil Bjornson, Joakim Jalden
Abstract: This paper optimizes the fronthaul bit allocation in massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems operating with limited-capacity fronthaul links. We consider an advanced antenna system (AAS) controlled by a centralized baseband unit (BBU). In the AAS, multiple antenna elements together with their radio units are integrated into a single unit. In this setup, a key challenge is allocating fronthaul bits between uplink channel state information (CSI) quantization and downlink precoding matrix quantization. We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it. Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.

Title: Building a Bridge between the Two Schools: Realizing a Practical Path to Include Literacy-based Skills within the STEM Curricula
Authors: Jorge Torres Gómez, Erika Gericke, Anton Rassõlkin, Mikołaj Leszczuk, Alexandru Iosup, Marcin Niemiec, Carmen Peláez-Moreno
Abstract: Developing students as well-rounded professionals is increasingly important for our modern society. Although there is a great consensus that technical and professional ("soft") skills should be developed and intertwined in the core of computer science subjects, there are still few examples of alike teaching methodologies at technical schools. This contribution investigates the integration of technical and professional skills while teaching specialized curricula in computer science. We propose a broadly applicable, step-by-step methodology that connects core technical concepts (e.g., information entropy, network security) with fine arts practices such as music, video production, gaming, and performing arts (e.g., Oxford-style debates). The methodology was applied in several computer science courses at technical universities, where quantitative and qualitative assessments, including student questionnaires and exam scores, showed improved learning outcomes and increased student engagement compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that this art-based integration can effectively bridge the historical divide between the two schools of thought, offering a practical direction for educators. Within this context, we also identify open issues that will guide future research on topics such as instructor engagement, female motivation in technical subjects, and scalability of these approaches.

Title: Bayesian quantum sensing using graybox machine learning
Authors: Akram Youssry, Stefan Todd, Patrick Murton, Muhammad Junaid Arshad, Alberto Peruzzo, Cristian Bonato
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer significant advantages over classical devices in spatial resolution and sensitivity, enabling transformative applications across materials science, healthcare, and beyond. Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields. In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance.

Title: Curvelet-Regularized SPDE Inversion on Piecewise-Planar Fractures with Trace-Graph Coupling
Authors: J.J. Segura
Abstract: We formulate a sparse-to-dense reconstruction layer for fractured media in which sparse point measurements are mapped onto piecewise-planar fracture supports inferred from 3D trace polylines. Each plane is discretized in local coordinates and estimated via a convex objective that combines a grid SPDE/GMRF quadratic prior with an $\ell_1$ penalty on undecimated discrete curvelet coefficients, targeting anisotropic, fracture-aligned structure that is poorly represented by isotropic smoothness alone. We further define an along-fracture distance through trace-network geodesics and express connectivity-driven regularization as a quadratic form $z^\top P^\top L_G P z$, where $L_G$ is a graph Laplacian on the trace network and $P$ maps plane grids to graph nodes; plane intersections are handled by linear consistency constraints sampled along intersection lines. The resulting optimization admits efficient splitting: sparse linear solves for the quadratic block and coefficient-wise shrinkage for the curvelet block, with standard ADMM convergence under convexity. We specify reproducible synthetic benchmarks, baselines, ablations, and sensitivity studies that isolate directional sparsity and connectivity effects, and provide reference code to generate the figures and quantitative tables.

Title: EuleroDec: A Complex-Valued RVQ-VAE for Efficient and Robust Audio Coding
Authors: Luca Cerovaz, Michele Mancusi, Emanuele Rodolà
Abstract: Audio codecs power discrete music generative modelling, music streaming, and immersive media by shrinking PCM audio to bandwidth-friendly bitrates. Recent works have gravitated towards processing in the spectral domain; however, spectrogram domains typically struggle with phase modeling, which is naturally complex-valued. Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion, we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance on phase coherence and waveform fidelity. Compared to standard baselines that train for hundreds of thousands of steps, our model, which reduces the training budget by an order of magnitude, is markedly more compute-efficient while preserving high perceptual quality.

Title: GenAI-Net: A Generative AI Framework for Automated Biomolecular Network Design
Authors: Maurice Filo, Nicolò Rossi, Zhou Fang, Mustafa Khammash
Abstract: Biomolecular networks underpin emerging technologies in synthetic biology-from robust biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering to smart therapeutics and cell-based diagnostics-and also provide a mechanistic language for understanding complex dynamics in natural and ecological systems. Yet designing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement a desired dynamical function remains largely manual: while a proposed network can be checked by simulation, the reverse problem of discovering a network from a behavioral specification is difficult, requiring substantial human insight to navigate a vast space of topologies and kinetic parameters with nonlinear and possibly stochastic dynamics. Here we introduce GenAI-Net, a generative AI framework that automates CRN design by coupling an agent that proposes reactions to simulation-based evaluation defined by a user-specified objective. GenAI-Net efficiently produces novel, topologically diverse solutions across multiple design tasks, including dose responses, complex logic gates, classifiers, oscillators, and robust perfect adaptation in deterministic and stochastic settings (including noise reduction). By turning specifications into families of circuit candidates and reusable motifs, GenAI-Net provides a general route to programmable biomolecular circuit design and accelerates the translation from desired function to implementable mechanisms.

Title: Stylizing ViT: Anatomy-Preserving Instance Style Transfer for Domain Generalization
Authors: Sebastian Doerrich, Francesco Di Salvo, Jonas Alle, Christian Ledig
Abstract: Deep learning models in medical image analysis often struggle with generalizability across domains and demographic groups due to data heterogeneity and scarcity. Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts. Additionally, we show that Stylizing ViT is effective beyond training, achieving a 17% performance improvement during inference when used for test-time augmentation.

This short paper presents insights from three iterations of deployment experience for remote monitoring system and the iterative improvement in hardware, modeling, and user interface guided by the Geriatric 4Ms framework (matters most, mentation, mobility, and medication). An LLM-assisted solution is developed to balance user experience (privacy-preserving, plug-and-play) and system performance.

Title: Higher-Order Gravitational Models: A Tutorial on Spherical Harmonics and the Newtonian Model
Authors: Felipe Arenas-Uribe
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational interactions is fundamental to the analysis, prediction, and control of space systems. While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation.

Title: RPNT: Robust Pre-trained Neural Transformer -- A Pathway for Generalized Motor Decoding
Authors: Hao Fang, Ryan A. Canfield, Tomohiro Ouchi, Beatrice Macagno, Eli Shlizerman, Amy L. Orsborn
Abstract: Brain decoding aims to interpret and translate neural activity into behaviors. As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks. Our results show that RPNT consistently achieves and surpasses the decoding performance of existing decoding models in all tasks.

Title: AVMeme Exam: A Multimodal Multilingual Multicultural Benchmark for LLMs' Contextual and Cultural Knowledge and Thinking

Abstract: Internet audio-visual clips convey meaning through time-varying sound and motion, which extend beyond what text alone can represent. To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content. These findings highlight a key gap in human-aligned multimodal intelligence and call for models that can perceive contextually and culturally beyond the surface of what they hear and see.

Title: BanglaRobustNet: A Hybrid Denoising-Attention Architecture for Robust Bangla Speech Recognition
Authors: Md Sazzadul Islam Ridoy, Mubaswira Ibnat Zidney, Sumi Akter, Md. Aminur Rahman
Abstract: Bangla, one of the most widely spoken languages, remains underrepresented in state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, particularly under noisy and speaker-diverse conditions. This paper presents BanglaRobustNet, a hybrid denoising-attention framework built on Wav2Vec-BERT, designed to address these challenges. The architecture integrates a diffusion-based denoising module to suppress environmental noise while preserving Bangla-specific phonetic cues, and a contextual cross-attention module that conditions recognition on speaker embeddings for robustness across gender, age, and dialects. Trained end-to-end with a composite objective combining CTC loss, phonetic consistency, and speaker alignment, BanglaRobustNet achieves substantial reductions in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) compared to Wav2Vec-BERT and Whisper baselines. Evaluations on Mozilla Common Voice Bangla and augmented noisy speech confirm the effectiveness of our approach, establishing BanglaRobustNet as a robust ASR system tailored to low-resource, noise-prone linguistic settings.

Title: Segment Length Matters: A Study of Segment Lengths on Audio Fingerprinting Performance
Authors: Ziling Gong, Yunyan Ouyang, Iram Kamdar, Melody Ma, Hongjie Chen, Franck Dernoncourt, Ryan A. Rossi, Nesreen K. Ahmed
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting provides an identifiable representation of acoustic signals, which can be later used for identification and retrieval systems. To obtain a discriminative representation, the input audio is usually segmented into shorter time intervals, allowing local acoustic features to be extracted and analyzed. Modern neural approaches typically operate on short, fixed-duration audio segments, yet the choice of segment duration is often made heuristically and rarely examined in depth. In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations. Our results show that short segment lengths (0.5-second) generally achieve better performance. Moreover, we evaluate LLM capacity in recommending the best segment length, which shows that GPT-5-mini consistently gives the best suggestions across five considerations among three studied LLMs. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting segment duration in large-scale neural audio retrieval systems.

Title: CaSNet: Compress-and-Send Network Based Multi-Device Speech Enhancement Model for Distributed Microphone Arrays
Authors: Chengqian Jiang, Jie Zhang, Haoyin Yan
Abstract: Distributed microphone array (DMA) is a promising next-generation platform for speech interaction, where speech enhancement (SE) is still required to improve the speech quality in noisy cases. Existing SE methods usually first gather raw waveforms at a fusion center (FC) from all devices and then design a multi-microphone model, causing high bandwidth and energy costs. In this work, we propose a \emph{Compress-and-Send Network (CaSNet)} for resource-constrained DMAs, where one microphone serves as the FC and reference. Each of other devices encodes the measured raw data into a feature matrix, which is then compressed by singular value decomposition (SVD) to produce a more compact representation. The received features at the FC are aligned via cross window query with respect to the reference, followed by neural decoding to yield spatially coherent enhanced speech. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed CaSNet can save the data amount with a negligible impact on the performance compared to the uncompressed case. The reproducible code is available at this https URL.

Title: Delay-Compensated Stiffness Estimation for Robot-Mediated Dyadic Interaction
Authors: Mingtian Du, Suhas Raghavendra Kulkarni, Bernardo Noronha, Domenico Campolo
Abstract: Robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interactions enable therapists to provide physical therapy remotely, yet an accurate perception of patient stiffness remains challenging due to network-induced haptic delays. Conventional stiffness estimation methods, which neglect delay, suffer from temporal misalignment between force and position signals, leading to significant estimation errors as delays increase. To address this, we propose a robust, delay-compensated stiffness estimation framework by deriving an algebraic estimator based on quasi-static equilibrium that explicitly accounts for temporally aligning the expert's input with the novice's response. A Normalised Weighted Least Squares (NWLS) implementation is then introduced to robustly filter dynamic bias resulting from the algebraic derivation. Experiments using commercial rehabilitation robots (H-MAN) as the platform demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the standard estimator, maintaining consistent tracking accuracy under multiple introduced delays. These findings offer a promising solution for achieving high-fidelity haptic perception in remote dyadic interaction, potentially facilitating reliable stiffness assessment in therapeutic settings across networks.

Title: Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading for Scalable Rydberg Atomic-MIMO Detection
Authors: Jiuyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers face significant scalability challenges in signal detection due to their nonlinear signal models. This letter proposes phase-rotated symbol spreading (PRSS), which transmits each symbol across two consecutive time slots with an optimal {\pi}/2 phase offset. PRSS enables reconstruction of an effective linear signal model while maintaining spectral efficiency and facilitating the use of conventional RF-MIMO detection algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that PRSS achieves greater than 2.5 dB and 10 dB bit error rate improvements compared to current single-transmission methods when employing optimal exhaustive search and low-complexity sub-optimal detection methods, respectively.

Title: dLLM-ASR: A Faster Diffusion LLM-based Framework for Speech Recognition
Authors: Wenjie Tian, Bingshen Mu, Guobin Ma, Xuelong Geng, Zhixian Zhao, Lei Xie
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) achieve superior performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs as decoders, but their token-by-token generation mechanism leads to inference latency that grows linearly with sequence length. Meanwhile, discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling high-quality parallel sequence generation with pretrained decoders. However, directly applying native text-oriented dLLMs to ASR leads to a fundamental mismatch between open-ended text generation and the acoustically conditioned transcription paradigm required by ASR. As a result, it introduces unnecessary difficulty and computational redundancy, such as denoising from pure noise, inflexible generation lengths, and fixed denoising steps. We propose dLLM-ASR, an efficient dLLM-based ASR framework that formulates dLLM's decoding as a prior-guided and adaptive denoising process. It leverages an ASR prior to initialize the denoising process and provide an anchor for sequence length. Building upon this prior, length-adaptive pruning dynamically removes redundant tokens, while confidence-based denoising allows converged tokens to exit the denoising loop early, enabling token-level adaptive computation. Experiments demonstrate that dLLM-ASR achieves recognition accuracy comparable to autoregressive LLM-based ASR systems and delivers a 4.44$\times$ inference speedup, establishing a practical and efficient paradigm for ASR.

Title: Interpreting Moment Matrix Blocks Spectra using Mutual Shadow Area
Authors: Yaniv Brick, Francesco P. Andriulli, Mats Gustafsson
Abstract: The mutual shadow area of pairs of surface regions is used for guiding the study of the spectral components and rank of their wave interaction, as captured by the corresponding moment matrix blocks. It is demonstrated that the mutual shadow area provides an asymptotically accurate predictor of the location of the singular value curve knee. This predicted knee index is shown to partition the interacting parts of the range and domain of blocks into two subspaces that can be associated with different wave phenomena: an "aperture" subspace of dimension that scales with the subdomains area (or length in 2-D) and a remainder "diffraction" subspace of dimension that scales much slower with the electrical length, depending on the geometric configuration. For interactions between open surface domains typical for the common hierarchical partitioning in most fast solvers, the latter can be attributed to the domain edges visible by its interacting counterpart. For interactions in 3-D with a small aspect angles between the source and observers, the diffraction subspace dimension is dominant in determining the rank until fairly large electrical lengths are reached. This explains the delayed asymptotic scaling of ranks and impressive fast solver performance observed in recent literature for seemingly arbitrary scatterers with no special geometric characteristics. In the extreme cases of "endfire" reduced dimensionality interactions, where the shadow area vanishes, the diffraction governs also the asymptotic rank, which translates to superior asymptotic solver performance.

Title: On maximum hands-off restricted hybrid control for discrete-time switched linear systems
Authors: Darsana U, Atreyee Kundu
Abstract: This paper deals with design of maximum hands-off hybrid control sequences for discrete-time switched linear systems. It is a sparsest combination of a discrete control sequence (i.e. the switching sequence) and a continuous control sequence, both satisfying pre-specified restrictions on the admissible actions, that steers a given initial state of the switched system to the origin of the state-space in a pre-specified duration of time. Given the subsystems dynamics, the sets of admissible continuous and discrete control, the initial state and the time horizon, we present a new algorithm that, under certain conditions on the subsystems dynamics and the admissible control, designs maximum hands-off hybrid control sequences for the resulting switched system. The key apparatuses for our analysis are graph theory and linear algebra. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate our results.

Title: A Cherry-Picking Approach to Large Load Shaping for More Effective Carbon Reduction
Authors: Bokan Chen, Raiden Hasegawa, Adriaan Hilbers, Ross Koningstein, Ana Radovanović, Utkarsh Shah, Gabriela Volpato, Mohamed Ahmed, Tim Cary, Rod Frowd
Abstract: Shaping multi-megawatt loads, such as data centers, impacts generator dispatch on the electric grid, which in turn affects system CO2 emissions and energy cost. Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that "cherry-picks" a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data. The cherry-picking approach to power load shaping is applicable to any large flexible consumer on the electricity grid, such as data centers, distributed energy resources and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).

Title: Neural-Inspired Multi-Agent Molecular Communication Networks for Collective Intelligence
Authors: Boran A. Kilic, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is a pivotal enabler for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). However, current research often relies on super-capable individual agents with complex transceiver architectures that defy the energy and processing constraints of realistic nanomachines. This paper proposes a paradigm shift towards collective intelligence, inspired by the cortical networks of the biological brain. We introduce a decentralized network architecture where simple nanomachines interact via a diffusive medium using a threshold-based firing mechanism modeled by Greenberg-Hastings (GH) cellular automata. We derive fixed-point equations for steady-state populations via mean-field analysis and validate them against stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that the network undergoes a second-order phase transition at a specific activation threshold. Crucially, we show that both pairwise and collective mutual information peak exactly at this critical transition point, confirming that the system maximizes information propagation and processing capacity at the edge of chaos.

Title: Physics-Integrated Inference for Signal Recovery in Non-Gaussian Regimes
Authors: Mohamed A. Mousa, Leif Bauer, Ziyi Yang, Utkarsh Singh, Angshuman Deka, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: High-performance room-temperature sensing is often limited by non-stationary $1/f$ fluctuations and non-Gaussian stochasticity. In spintronic devices, thermally activated Néel switching creates heavy-tailed noise that masks weak signals, defeating linear filters optimized for Gaussian statistics. Here, we introduce a physics-integrated inference framework that decouples signal morphology from stochastic transients using a hierarchical 1D CNN-GRU topology. By learning the temporal signatures of Néel relaxation, this architecture reduces the Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of spintronic Poisson bolometers by a factor of six (233.78 mK to 40.44 mK), effectively elevating room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. We demonstrate the framework's universality across the electromagnetic and biological spectrum, achieving a 9-fold error suppression in Radar tracking, a 40\% uncertainty reduction in LiDAR, and a 15.56 dB SNR enhancement in ECG. This hardware-inference coupling recovers deterministic signals from fluctuation-dominated regimes, enabling near-ideal detection limits in noisy edge environments.

Title: From Human Speech to Ocean Signals: Transferring Speech Large Models for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition
Authors: Mengcheng Huang, Xue Zhou, Chen Xu, Dapeng Man
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) plays a vital role in marine applications but remains challenging due to limited labeled data and the complexity of ocean environments. This paper explores a central question: can speech large models (SLMs), trained on massive human speech corpora, be effectively transferred to underwater acoustics? To investigate this, we propose UATR-SLM, a simple framework that reuses the speech feature pipeline, adapts the SLM as an acoustic encoder, and adds a lightweight this http URL on the DeepShip and ShipsEar benchmarks show that UATR-SLM achieves over 99% in-domain accuracy, maintains strong robustness across variable signal lengths, and reaches up to 96.67% accuracy in cross-domain evaluation. These results highlight the strong transferability of SLMs to UATR, establishing a promising paradigm for leveraging speech foundation models in underwater acoustics.

Title: Success Conditioning as Policy Improvement: The Optimization Problem Solved by Imitating Success
Authors: Daniel Russo
Abstract: A widely used technique for improving policies is success conditioning, in which one collects trajectories, identifies those that achieve a desired outcome, and updates the policy to imitate the actions taken along successful trajectories. This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $\chi^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice-ASR, a general-purpose speech understanding framework built upon VibeVoice, designed to address the persistent challenges of context fragmentation and multi-speaker complexity in long-form audio (e.g., meetings, podcasts) that remain despite recent advancements in short-form speech recognition. Unlike traditional pipelined approaches that rely on audio chunking, VibeVoice-ASRsupports single-pass processing for up to 60 minutes of audio. It unifies Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, and Timestamping into a single end-to-end generation task. In addition, VibeVoice-ASR supports over 50 languages, requires no explicit language setting, and natively handles code-switching within and across utterances. Furthermore, we introduce a prompt-based context injection mechanism that allows users to supply customized conetxt, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific terminology and polyphonic character disambiguation.

Title: LLM-ForcedAligner: A Non-Autoregressive and Accurate LLM-Based Forced Aligner for Multilingual and Long-Form Speech
Authors: Bingshen Mu, Xian Shi, Xiong Wang, Hexin Liu, Jin Xu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) predicts start and end timestamps for words or characters in speech, but existing methods are language-specific and prone to cumulative temporal shifts. The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods. The checkpoint and inference code will be released later.

Title: A Heterogeneous Massive MIMO Technique for Uniform Service in Cellular Networks
Authors: Wei Jiang, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: Traditional cellular networks struggle with poor quality of service (QoS) for cell-edge users, while cell-free (CF) systems offer uniform QoS but incur high roll-out costs due to acquiring numerous access point (AP) sites and deploying a large-scale optical fiber network to connect them. This paper proposes a cost-effective heterogeneous massive MIMO architecture that integrates centralized co-located antennas at a cell-center base station with distributed edge APs. By strategically splitting massive antennas between centralized and distributed nodes, the system maintains high user fairness comparable to CF systems but reduces infrastructure costs substantially, by minimizing the required number of AP sites and fronthaul connections. Numerical results demonstrate its superiority in balancing performance and costs compared to cellular and CF systems.

Title: A Generative AI-Driven Reliability Layer for Action-Oriented Disaster Resilience
Authors: Geunsik Lim
Abstract: As climate-related hazards intensify, conventional early warning systems (EWS) disseminate alerts rapidly but often fail to trigger timely protective actions, leading to preventable losses and inequities. We introduce Climate RADAR (Risk-Aware, Dynamic, and Action Recommendation system), a generative AI-based reliability layer that reframes disaster communication from alerts delivered to actions executed. It integrates meteorological, hydrological, vulnerability, and social data into a composite risk index and employs guardrail-embedded large language models (LLMs) to deliver personalized recommendations across citizen, volunteer, and municipal interfaces. Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot shows improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust. By combining predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI, Climate RADAR advances people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.

Title: OCR-Enhanced Multimodal ASR Can Read While Listening
Authors: Junli Chen, Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Guangzhi Sun, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Visual information, such as subtitles in a movie, often helps automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we propose Donut-Whisper, an audio-visual ASR model with dual encoder to leverage visual information to improve speech recognition performance in both English and Chinese. Donut-Whisper combines the advantage of the linear and the Q-Former-based modality alignment structures via a cross-attention module, generating more powerful audio-visual features. Meanwhile, we propose a lightweight knowledge distillation scheme showcasing the potential of using audio-visual models to teach audio-only models to achieve better performance. Moreover, we propose a new multilingual audio-visual speech recognition dataset based on movie clips containing both Chinese and English partitions. As a result, Donut-Whisper achieved significantly better performance on both English and Chinese partition of the dataset compared to both Donut and Whisper large V3 baselines. In particular, an absolute 5.75% WER reduction and a 16.5% absolute CER reduction were achieved on the English and Chinese sets respectively compared to the Whisper ASR baseline.

Authors: Ivan Bondarenko, Daniil Grebenkin, Oleg Sedukhin, Mikhail Klementev, Roman Derunets, Lyudmila Budneva
Abstract: This work presents a speech-to-text system "Pisets" for scientists and journalists which is based on a three-component architecture aimed at improving speech recognition accuracy while minimizing errors and hallucinations associated with the Whisper model. The architecture comprises primary recognition using Wav2Vec2, false positive filtering via the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and final speech recognition through Whisper. The implementation of curriculum learning methods and the utilization of diverse Russian-language speech corpora significantly enhanced the system's effectiveness. Additionally, advanced uncertainty modeling techniques were introduced, contributing to further improvements in transcription quality. The proposed approaches ensure robust transcribing of long audio data across various acoustic conditions compared to WhisperX and the usual Whisper model. The source code of "Pisets" system is publicly available at GitHub: this https URL.

Title: Geneses: Unified Generative Speech Enhancement and Separation
Authors: Kohei Asai, Wataru Nakata, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Real-world audio recordings often contain multiple speakers and various degradations, which limit both the quantity and quality of speech data available for building state-of-the-art speech processing models. Although end-to-end approaches that concatenate speech enhancement (SE) and speech separation (SS) to obtain a clean speech signal for each speaker are promising, conventional SE-SS methods suffer from complex degradations beyond additive noise. To this end, we propose \textbf{Geneses}, a generative framework to achieve unified, high-quality SE--SS. Our Geneses leverages latent flow matching to estimate each speaker's clean speech features using multi-modal diffusion Transformer conditioned on self-supervised learning representation from noisy mixture. We conduct experimental evaluation using two-speaker mixtures from LibriTTS-R under two conditions: additive-noise-only and complex degradations. The results demonstrate that Geneses significantly outperforms a conventional mask-based SE--SS method across various objective metrics with high robustness against complex degradations. Audio samples are available in our demo page.

Title: An Unsupervised Tensor-Based Domain Alignment
Authors: Chong Hyun Lee, Kibae Lee, Hyun Hee Yim
Abstract: We propose a tensor-based domain alignment (DA) algorithm designed to align source and target tensors within an invariant subspace through the use of alignment matrices. These matrices along with the subspace undergo iterative optimization of which constraint is on oblique manifold, which offers greater flexibility and adaptability compared to the traditional Stiefel manifold. Moreover, regularization terms defined to preserve the variance of both source and target tensors, ensures robust performance. Our framework is versatile, effectively generalizing existing tensor-based DA methods as special cases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances DA conversion speed but also significantly boosts classification accuracy. This positions our method as superior to current state-of-the-art techniques, making it a preferable choice for complex domain adaptation tasks.

Title: Uncooled Poisson Bolometer for High-Speed Event-Based Long-wave Thermal Imaging
Authors: Mohamed A. Mousa, Leif Bauer, Utkarsh Singh, Ziyi Yang, Angshuman Deka, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: Event-based vision provides high-speed, energy-efficient sensing for applications such as autonomous navigation and motion tracking. However, implementing this technology in the long-wave infrared remains a significant challenge. Traditional infrared sensors are hindered by slow thermal response times or the heavy power requirements of cryogenic cooling. Here, we introduce the first event-based infrared detector operating in a Poisson-counting regime. This is realized with a spintronic Poisson bolometer capable of broadband detection from 0.8-14$\mu\text{m}$. In this regime, infrared signals are detected through statistically resolvable changes in stochastic switching events. This approach enables room-temperature operation with high timing resolution. Our device achieves a maximum event rate of 1,250 Hz, surpassing the temporal resolution of conventional uncooled microbolometers by a factor of 4. Power consumption is kept low at 0.2$\mu$W per pixel. This work establishes an operating principle for infrared sensing and demonstrates a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient, event-driven thermal imaging.

Title: COMETS: Coordinated Multi-Destination Video Transmission with In-Network Rate Adaptation
Authors: Yulong Zhang, Ying Cui, Zili Meng, Abhishek Kumar, Dirk Kutscher
Abstract: Large-scale video streaming events attract millions of simultaneous viewers, stressing existing delivery infrastructures. Client-driven adaptation reacts slowly to shared congestion, while server-based coordination introduces scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. We present COMETS, a coordinated multi-destination video transmission framework that leverages information-centric networking principles such as request aggregation and in-network state awareness to enable scalable, fair, and adaptive rate control. COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency. The results highlight COMETS as a practical, deployable approach for next-generation scalable video delivery.

Title: ART for Diffusion Sampling: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Timestep Schedule
Authors: Yilie Huang, Wenpin Tang, Xunyu Zhou
Abstract: We consider time discretization for score-based diffusion models to generate samples from a learned reverse-time dynamic on a finite grid. Uniform and hand-crafted grids can be suboptimal given a budget on the number of time steps. We introduce Adaptive Reparameterized Time (ART) that controls the clock speed of a reparameterized time variable, leading to a time change and uneven timesteps along the sampling trajectory while preserving the terminal time. The objective is to minimize the aggregate error arising from the discretized Euler scheme. We derive a randomized control companion, ART-RL, and formulate time change as a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) problem with Gaussian policies. We then prove that solving ART-RL recovers the optimal ART schedule, which in turn enables practical actor--critic updates to learn the latter in a data-driven way. Empirically, based on the official EDM pipeline, ART-RL improves Fréchet Inception Distance on CIFAR-10 over a wide range of budgets and transfers to AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet without the need of retraining.

Title: Multi-Stage Structured Estimators for Information Freshness
Authors: Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus, Nail Akar
Abstract: Most of the contemporary literature on information freshness solely focuses on the analysis of freshness for martingale estimators, which simply use the most recently received update as the current estimate. While martingale estimators are easier to analyze, they are far from optimal, especially in pull-based update systems, where maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are known to be optimal, but are analytically challenging. In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness.

Title: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Tactical Decision Making for Trucks in Highway Traffic
Authors: Deepthi Pathare, Leo Laine, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani
Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and operational costs in highway driving poses a challenging decision-making problem for heavy-duty vehicles. A central difficulty is that conventional scalar reward formulations, obtained by aggregating these competing objectives, often obscure the structure of their trade-offs. We present a Proximal Policy Optimization based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that learns a continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs and evaluates it on a scalable simulation platform for tactical decision making in trucks. The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively. The resulting Pareto frontier is smooth and interpretable, enabling flexibility in choosing driving behavior along different conflicting objectives. This framework allows seamless transitions between different driving policies without retraining, yielding a robust and adaptive decision-making strategy for autonomous trucking applications.

Title: Target Detection in Sea Clutter with Application to Spaceborne SAR Imaging
Authors: Shahrokh Hamidi
Abstract: In this paper, the challenging task of target detection in sea clutter is addressed. We analyze the statistical properties of the signals which have been received from the scene and based on that, we model the amplitude of the signals that have been reflected from the background sea clutter according to several well-known probability distribution functions. Next, by exploiting the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric as a goodness-of-fit test, we will demonstrate that among the proposed probability distributions, the Weibull distribution can model the statistical properties of the background sea clutter with higher accuracy. Subsequently, we utilize the aforementioned information to design an adaptive threshold based on the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm to detect the energy of the targets which have been buried in the sea clutter. Thorough analysis of the experimental data gathered from the Canadian RADARSAT-1 satellite demonstrates the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This article investigates the influential role of flexible antenna array curvature on the performance of 6G communication systems with carrier frequencies above 100 GHz. It is demonstrated that the curvature of flexible antenna arrays can be leveraged for 2-dimensional beam alignment in phased arrays with relatively small insertion loss. The effect of antenna array bending on the radiation properties such as gain and antenna impedance are analytically studied and simulated for a 4x4 microstrip patch antenna array operating between 97.5-102.5 GHz. Moreover, the deployment of this flexible antenna array in conjunction with state-of-the-art flexible board packaging techniques is examined for 6G wireless transceivers based on 65nm CMOS technology and simulated for three variants of quadrature amplitude modulation (4QAM, 16 QAM, and 64 QAM). The communication performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) is evaluated using analytical derivations and simulation results which exhibit a relatively close match.

Authors: Sampada Deglurkar, Haotian Shen, Anish Muthali, Marco Pavone, Dragos Margineantu, Peter Karkus, Boris Ivanovic, Claire J. Tomlin
Abstract: Modern autonomous systems with machine learning components often use uncertainty quantification to help produce assurances about system operation. However, there is a lack of consensus in the community on what uncertainty is and how to perform uncertainty quantification. In this work, we propose that uncertainty measures should be understood within the context of overall system design and operation. To this end, we present two novel analysis techniques. First, we produce a probabilistic specification on a module's uncertainty measure given a system specification. Second, we propose a method to measure a system's input-output robustness in order to compare system designs and quantify the impact of making a system uncertainty-aware. In addition to this theoretical work, we present the application of these analyses on two real-world autonomous systems: an autonomous driving system and an aircraft runway incursion detection system. We show that our analyses can determine desired relationships between module uncertainty and error, provide visualizations of how well an uncertainty measure is being used by a system, produce principled comparisons between different uncertainty measures and decision-making algorithm designs, and provide insights into system vulnerabilities and tradeoffs.

Title: MorphiNet: A Graph Subdivision Network for Adaptive Bi-ventricle Surface Reconstruction
Authors: Yu Deng, Yiyang Xu, Linglong Qian, Charlène Mauger, Anastasia Nasopoulou, Steven Williams, Michelle Williams, Steven Niederer, David Newby, Andrew McCulloch, Jeff Omens, Kuberan Pushprajah, Alistair Young
Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used for heart model reconstruction and digital twin computational analysis because of its ability to visualize soft tissues and capture dynamic functions. However, CMR images have an anisotropic nature, characterized by large inter-slice distances and misalignments from cardiac motion. These limitations result in data loss and measurement inaccuracies, hindering the capture of detailed anatomical structures. In this work, we introduce MorphiNet, a novel network that reproduces heart anatomy learned from high-resolution Computed Tomography (CT) images, unpaired with CMR images. MorphiNet encodes the anatomical structure as gradient fields, deforming template meshes into patient-specific geometries. A multilayer graph subdivision network refines these geometries while maintaining a dense point correspondence, suitable for computational analysis. MorphiNet achieved state-of-the-art bi-ventricular myocardium reconstruction on CMR patients with tetralogy of Fallot with 0.3 higher Dice score and 2.6 lower Hausdorff distance compared to the best existing template-based methods. While matching the anatomical fidelity of comparable neural implicit function methods, MorphiNet delivered 50$\times$ faster inference. Cross-dataset validation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge confirmed robust generalization, achieving a 0.7 Dice score with 30\% improvement over previous template-based approaches. We validate our anatomical learning approach through the successful restoration of missing cardiac structures and demonstrate significant improvement over standard Loop subdivision. Motion tracking experiments further confirm MorphiNet's capability for cardiac function analysis, including accurate ejection fraction calculation that correctly identifies myocardial dysfunction in tetralogy of Fallot patients.

Title: Cooperative Optimal Output Tracking for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems: Stabilizing Policy Iteration Frameworks
Authors: Dongdong Li, Jiuxiang Dong
Abstract: This paper proposes two cooperative optimal output tracking (COOT) algorithms based on policy iteration (PI) for discrete-time multi-agent systems with unknown model parameters. First, we establish a stabilizing PI framework that can start from any initial control policy, relaxing the dependence of traditional PI on the initial stabilizing control policy. Then, another efficient and equivalent Q-learning framework is developed, which is shown to require only less system data to get the same results as the stabilizing PI. In the two frameworks, the stabilizing control policy is obtained by gradually iterating the stabilizing virtual system to the actual feedback closed-loop system. Two explicit schemes for adjusting the iteration step-size/coefficient are designed and their stability is analyzed. Finally, the COOT is realized by a distributed feedforward-feedback controller with learned optimal gains. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.

Title: Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?
Authors: Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Transformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 20% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.

Title: Efficient UAV Coverage in Large Convex Quadrilateral Areas with Elliptical Footprints
Authors: Alexander Vavoulas, Konstantinos K. Delibasis, Harilaos G. Sandalidis, George Nousias, Nicholas Vaiopoulos
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention for improving wireless communication, especially in emergencies or as a complement to existing cellular infrastructure. This letter addresses the problem of efficiently covering a large convex quadrilateral using multiple UAVs, where each UAV generates elliptical coverage footprints based on its altitude and antenna tilt. The challenge is approached using circle-packing techniques within a unit square to arrange UAVs in an optimal configuration. Subsequently, a homography transformation is applied to map the unit square onto the quadrilateral area, ensuring that the UAVs' elliptical footprints cover the entire region. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing insight into coverage density and optimal altitude configurations for different placement scenarios. The results highlight the scalability and potential for improving UAV-based communication systems, focusing on maximizing coverage efficiency in large areas with irregular shapes.

Title: Real-Time Load Estimation for Load-lifting Exoskeletons Using Insole Pressure Sensors and Machine Learning
Authors: Kaida Wu, Peihao Xiang, Chaohao Lin, Ou Bai
Abstract: To enhance lifting-load estimation accuracy in industrial upper-limb assistive exoskeletons, this study proposes a machine learning-based approach using insole pressure sensors. Unlike traditional methods that rely on electromyography (EMG), force sensors, or posture data, insole pressure sensors provide a non-invasive, posture-independent, and stable solution suitable for long-term use. Lifting load data ranging from 2 to 10 kg (0.5 kg intervals) were collected from five subjects. Two data representations were investigated: channel-based vectors and map-based images. For the channel-based approach, conventional regression models (SVR, MLP, and Elastic Net) were trained on pooled data from all subjects to assess inter-subject generalization, specifically testing the ability to infer load levels unseen during training. In parallel, a preliminary feasibility study was conducted for the map-based deep learning model (MobileNetV2) using inner-subject data. Results indicate that the channel-based SVR achieved the most balanced accuracy and generalization performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.547 kg. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using insole pressure data for variable load estimation, supporting control strategies in industrial exoskeleton applications.

Title: Physics-Guided Multi-View Graph Neural Network for Schizophrenia Classification via Structural-Functional Coupling
Authors: Badhan Mazumder, Ayush Kanyal, Lei Wu, Vince D. Calhoun, Dong Hye Ye
Abstract: Clinical studies reveal disruptions in brain structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ). Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach.

Title: Backpressure-based Mean-field Type Game for Scheduling in Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks
Authors: Salah Eddine Choutri, Boualem Djehiche, Prajwal Chauhan, Saif Eddin Jabari
Abstract: We propose a Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) framework for effective scheduling in multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using backpressure as a performance criterion. Traditional backpressure algorithms leverage queue differentials to regulate data flow and maintain network stability. In this work, we extend the backpressure framework by incorporating a mean-field term into the cost functional, capturing the global behavior of the system alongside local dynamics. The resulting model utilizes the strengths of non-cooperative mean-field type games, enabling nodes to make decentralized decisions based on both individual queue states and system mean-field effects while accounting for stochastic network interactions. By leveraging the interplay between backpressure dynamics and mean-field coupling, the approach balances local optimization with global efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling congestion and scheduling in large-scale WSNs.

Title: Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Tasking over Rate-Limited Wireless Channels with Implicit Optimal Prior
Authors: Ahmad Halimi Razlighi, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: In this work, we expand the cooperative multi-task semantic communication framework (CMT-SemCom) introduced in [1], which divides the semantic encoder on the transmitter side into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs), to a more applicable design. Our proposed system model addresses real-world constraints by introducing a general design that operates over rate-limited wireless channels. Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint, represented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the density ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By applying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid learning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric machine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our framework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs variational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system's effectiveness in rate-constrained multi-task SemCom scenarios, highlighting its potential for enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Whole Slide Concepts: A Supervised Foundation Model For Pathological Images
Authors: Till Nicke, Daniela Schacherer, Jan Raphael Schäfer, Natalia Artysh, Antje Prasse, André Homeyer, Andrea Schenk, Henning Höfener, Johannes Lotz
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming computational pathology by offering new ways to analyze histopathology images. However, FMs typically require weeks of training on large databases, making their creation a resource-intensive process. In this paper, we present a training for foundation models from whole slide images using supervised, end-to-end, multitask learning on slide-level labels. Notably, it is the first model to incorporate cancer subtyping, risk estimation, and genetic mutation prediction into one model. The presented model outperforms self-supervised models on seven benchmark tasks while the training only required 5% of the computational resources. The results not only show that supervised training can outperform self-supervision with less data, but also offer a solution to annotation problems, as patient-based labels are widely available through routine clinical processes. Furthermore, an attention module provides a layer of explainability across different tasks and serves as a tumor detector for unseen cancer types. To address the issue of closed-source datasets, the model was fully trained on openly available data. The code and model weights are made available under this https URL.

Title: Harmonization in Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Survey of Acquisition, Image-level, and Feature-level Methods
Authors: Qinqin Yang, Firoozeh Shomal-Zadeh, Ali Gholipour
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly advanced neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit substantial heterogeneity, known as batch effects or site effects. These non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals, reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization is grounded in the central hypothesis that site-related biases can be eliminated or mitigated while preserving meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, methodological advances, publicly available datasets, and evaluation metrics in the field of MRI harmonization. We systematically cover the full imaging pipeline and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition and reconstruction, retrospective image-level and feature-level methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. By synthesizing existing methods and evidence, we revisit the central hypothesis of image harmonization and show that, although site invariance can be achieved with current techniques, further evaluation is required to verify the preservation of biological information. To this end, we summarize the remaining challenges and highlight key directions for future research, including the need for standardized validation benchmarks, improved evaluation strategies, and tighter integration of harmonization methods across the imaging pipeline.

Title: Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in Electricity Markets
Authors: Wenqian Jiang, Aditya Rangarajan, Line Roald
Abstract: An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper analyzes a method to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing by introducing consumer-based carbon costs and a carbon allocation mechanism. Specifically, consumers submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. The carbon allocation mechanism then assigns emissions from generation to consumers to minimize overall carbon costs. Our analysis starts from a previously proposed centralized market clearing formulation that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility, and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation that incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and demand reductions.

Title: Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): A Tutorial
Authors: Yuanwei Liu, Hao Jiang, Xiaoxia Xu, Zhaolin Wang, Jia Guo, Chongjun Ouyang, Xidong Mu, Zhiguo Ding, Arumugam Nallanathan, George K. Karagiannidis, Robert Schober
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.

Title: Predictive Communications for Low-Altitude Networks
Authors: Junting Chen, Bowen Li, Hao Sun, Shuguang Cui, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.

Title: MELA-TTS: Joint transformer-diffusion model with representation alignment for speech synthesis
Authors: Keyu An, Zhiyu Zhang, Changfeng Gao, Yabin Li, Zhendong Peng, Haoxu Wang, Zhihao Du, Han Zhao, Zhifu Gao, Xiangang Li
Abstract: This work introduces MELA-TTS, a novel joint transformer-diffusion framework for end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. By autoregressively generating continuous mel-spectrogram frames from linguistic and speaker conditions, our architecture eliminates the need for speech tokenization and multi-stage processing pipelines. To address the inherent difficulties of modeling continuous features, we propose a representation alignment module that aligns output representations of the transformer decoder with semantic embeddings from a pretrained ASR encoder during training. This mechanism not only speeds up training convergence, but also enhances cross-modal coherence between the textual and acoustic domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MELA-TTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining robust zero-shot voice cloning capabilities, in both offline and streaming synthesis modes. Our results establish a new benchmark for continuous feature generation approaches in TTS, offering a compelling alternative to discrete-token-based paradigms.

Title: VoXtream: Full-Stream Text-to-Speech with Extremely Low Latency
Authors: Nikita Torgashov, Gustav Eje Henter, Gabriel Skantze
Abstract: We present VoXtream, a fully autoregressive, zero-shot streaming text-to-speech (TTS) system for real-time use that begins speaking from the first word. VoXtream directly maps incoming phonemes to audio tokens using a monotonic alignment scheme and a limited look-ahead that does not delay onset. Built around an incremental phoneme transformer, a temporal transformer predicting semantic and duration tokens, and a depth transformer producing acoustic tokens, VoXtream achieves, to our knowledge, the lowest initial delay among publicly available streaming TTS: 102 ms on GPU. Despite being trained on a mid-scale 9k-hour corpus, it matches or surpasses larger baselines on several metrics, while delivering competitive quality in both output- and full-streaming settings. Demo and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Investigation of ArUco Marker Placement for Planar Indoor Localization
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Martina Scheffler, Bin Yang
Abstract: Indoor localization of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can be realized with fiducial markers. Such systems require only a simple, monocular camera as sensor and fiducial markers as passive, identifiable position references that can be printed on a piece of paper and distributed in the area of interest. Thus, fiducial marker systems can be scaled to large areas with a minor increase in system complexity and cost. We investigate the localization behavior of the fiducial marker framework ArUco w.r.t. the placement of the markers including the number of markers, their orientation w.r.t. the camera, and the camera-marker distance. In addition, we propose a simple Kalman filter with adaptive measurement noise variances for real-time AMR tracking.

Title: Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet
Authors: Mohammad Ali Vahedifar, Qi Zhang
Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%, while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy, SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.

Title: ARTI-6: Towards Six-dimensional Articulatory Speech Encoding
Authors: Jihwan Lee, Sean Foley, Thanathai Lertpetchpun, Kevin Huang, Yoonjeong Lee, Tiantian Feng, Louis Goldstein, Dani Byrd, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable, computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.

Title: TASU: Text-Only Alignment for Speech Understanding
Authors: Jing Peng, Yi Yang, Xu Li, Yu Xi, Quanwei Tang, Yangui Fang, Junjie Li, Kai Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have paved the way for unified architectures across diverse speech understanding tasks. However, prevailing alignment paradigms rely heavily on large-scale audio-text paired data and computationally intensive training, yet often exhibit limited generalization to unseen domains or tasks. To address these limitations, we propose TASU (Text-only Alignment for Speech Understanding), a novel alignment paradigm that can leverage only unpaired text data to guide cross-modal alignment. Experiments show that TASU achieves competitive zero-shot speech recognition. Leveraging this property, it can further function as a pre-training stage in curriculum learning, enhancing domain generalization in speech recognition. Ultimately, TASU can extend its zero-shot generalization to a wide range of speech understanding tasks and notably outperforms prominent Speech LLMs including GLM-4-Voice and Step-Audio on the MMSU benchmark, establishing TASU as an efficient and scalable alignment paradigm for Speech LLMs.

Title: How Far Do SSL Speech Models Listen for Tone? Temporal Focus of Tone Representation under Low-resource Transfer
Authors: Minu Kim, Ji Sub Um, Hoirin Kim
Abstract: Lexical tone is central to many languages but remains underexplored in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, especially beyond Mandarin. We study four languages with complex and diverse tone systems (Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese) to ask how far such models "listen" for tone and how transfer operates in low-resource conditions. As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues: approximately 100ms (Burmese/Thai) and 180ms (Lao/Vietnamese). Probes and gradient analysis on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias toward overly long spans. These findings indicate that tone transfer is shaped by downstream task, highlighting task effects on temporal focus in tone modeling.

Title: Laboratory and field testing of a residential heat pump retrofit for a DC solar nanogrid
Authors: Aaron H.P. Farha, Jonathan P. Ore, Elias N. Pergantis, Davide Ziviani, Eckhard A. Groll, Kevin J. Kircher
Abstract: Residential buildings are increasingly integrating large devices that run natively on direct current (DC), such as solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and DC motors that drive heat pumps and other major appliances. Today, these natively-DC devices typically connect within buildings through alternating current (AC) distribution systems, entailing significant energy losses due to conversions between AC and DC. This paper investigates the alternative of connecting DC devices through DC distribution. Specifically, this paper shows through laboratory and field experiments that an off-the-shelf residential heat pump designed for conventional AC systems can be powered directly on DC with few hardware modifications and little change in performance. Supporting simulations of a DC nanogrid including {historical heat pump and rest-of-house load measurements,} a solar photovoltaic array, and a stationary battery suggest that connecting these devices through DC distribution could decrease annual electricity bills by 12.5% with an after-market AC-to-DC heat pump retrofit and by 16.7% with a heat pump designed to run on DC.

Title: Random Access for LEO Satellite Communication Systems via Deep Learning
Authors: Hyunwoo Lee, Ian P. Roberts, Jinkyo Jeong, Daesik Hong
Abstract: Integrating contention-based random access procedures into low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems poses new challenges, including long propagation delays, large Doppler shifts, and a large number of simultaneous access attempts. These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes.

Title: XLSR-MamBo: Scaling the Hybrid Mamba-Attention Backbone for Audio Deepfake Detection
Authors: Kwok-Ho Ng, Tingting Song, Yongdong WU, Zhihua Xia
Abstract: Advanced speech synthesis technologies have enabled highly realistic speech generation, posing security risks that motivate research into audio deepfake detection (ADD). While state space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, pure causal SSMs architectures often struggle with the content-based retrieval required to capture global frequency-domain artifacts. To address this, we explore the scaling properties of hybrid architectures by proposing XLSR-MamBo, a modular framework integrating an XLSR front-end with synergistic Mamba-Attention backbones. We systematically evaluate four topological designs using advanced SSM variants, Mamba, Mamba2, Hydra, and Gated DeltaNet. Experimental results demonstrate that the MamBo-3-Hydra-N3 configuration achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art systems on the ASVspoof 2021 LA, DF, and In-the-Wild benchmarks. This performance benefits from Hydra's native bidirectional modeling, which captures holistic temporal dependencies more efficiently than the heuristic dual-branch strategies employed in prior works. Furthermore, evaluations on the DFADD dataset demonstrate robust generalization to unseen diffusion- and flow-matching-based synthesis methods. Crucially, our analysis reveals that scaling backbone depth effectively mitigates the performance variance and instability observed in shallower models. These results demonstrate the hybrid framework's ability to capture artifacts in spoofed speech signals, providing an effective method for ADD.

Title: Cyberattack Detection in Virtualized Microgrids Using LightGBM and Knowledge-Distilled Classifiers
Authors: Osasumwen Cedric Ogiesoba-Eguakun, Suman Rath
Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.

Title: Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning
Authors: Shadeeb Hossain
Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.

Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and high reliability to ensure stability and transparency in touch-enabled teleoperation. However, variable delays and packet loss present significant challenges to maintaining immersive haptic communication. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that integrates Discrete Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Shapley Mode Value (SMV) for accurate and timely haptic signal prediction. DMD decomposes haptic signals into interpretable intrinsic modes, while SMV evaluates each mode's contribution to prediction accuracy, which is well-aligned with the goal-oriented semantic communication. Integrating SMV with DMD further accelerates inference, enabling efficient communication and smooth teleoperation even under adverse network conditions. Extensive experiments show that DMD+SMV, combined with a Transformer architecture, outperforms baseline methods significantly. It achieves 98.9% accuracy for 1-sample prediction and 92.5% for 100-sample prediction, as well as extremely low inference latency: 0.056 ms and 2 ms, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework has strong potential to ease the stringent latency and reliability requirements of TI without compromising performance, highlighting its feasibility for real-world deployment in TI systems.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Phuong Nam Tran, Nhan Thanh Nguyen, Hien Quoc Ngo, Markku Juntti
Abstract: In this paper, we consider power allocation and antenna activation of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method.

Title: Electrical Design of a Clean Offshore Heat and Power (CleanOFF) Hub
Authors: Maiken Borud Omtveit, Qian Long, Valentin Chabaud, Marte Ruud-Olsen, Steinar Halsne, Tor-Christian Ystgaard
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil & gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.

Title: Sequential Operating Simulation of Solid State Transformer-Driven Next-Generation 800 VDC Data Center
Authors: Jian Xu, Xinxiong Jiang, Yi Bao, Yuchen Zheng, Xuhui Chen, Qiang Xu, Siyang Liao, Deping Ke, Xiaoqi Gao
Abstract: Artificial-intelligence (AI) workloads are driving rapid growth in data-center electricity use and rack power density, increasing demand for power-delivery systems that are efficient and robust to fast load transients. Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design. Overall, the work provides a reproducible evaluation workflow and actionable guidance for next-generation AI data centers.

Title: Sound event localization and classification using WASN in Outdoor Environment
Authors: Dongzhe Zhang, Jianfeng Chen, Jisheng Bai, Mou Wang, Dongyuan Shi, Qixiang Niu, Alberto Bernardini
Abstract: Deep learning-based sound event localization and classification is an emerging research area within wireless acoustic sensor networks. However, current methods for sound event localization and classification typically rely on a single microphone array, making them susceptible to signal attenuation and environmental noise, which limits their monitoring range. Moreover, methods using multiple microphone arrays often focus solely on source localization, neglecting the aspect of sound event classification. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method that employs multiple features and attention mechanisms to estimate the location and class of sound source. We introduce a Soundmap feature to capture spatial information across multiple frequency bands. We also use the Gammatone filter to generate acoustic features more suitable for outdoor environments. Furthermore, we integrate attention mechanisms to learn channel-wise relationships and temporal dependencies within the acoustic features. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments using simulated datasets with different levels of noise and size of monitoring areas, as well as different arrays and source positions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in both sound event classification and sound source localization tasks. And we provide further analysis to explain the reasons for the observed errors.

Title: A Multimodal Feature Distillation with Mamba-Transformer Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Incomplete Modalities
Authors: Ming Kang, Fung Fung Ting, Shier Nee Saw, Raphaël C.-W. Phan, Zongyuan Ge, Chee-Ming Ting
Abstract: Existing brain tumor segmentation methods usually utilize multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities in brain tumor images for segmentation, which can achieve better segmentation performance. However, in clinical applications, some modalities are often missing due to resource constraints, resulting in significant performance degradation for methods that rely on complete modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal feature distillation with Mamba-Transformer hybrid network (MMTSeg) for accurate brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. We first employ a Multimodal Feature Distillation (MFD) module to distill feature-level multimodal knowledge into different unimodalities to extract complete modality information. We further develop an Unimodal Feature Enhancement (UFE) module to model the semantic relationship between global and local information. Finally, we built a Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module to explicitly align the global correlations across modalities, even when some modalities are missing. Complementary features within and across modalities are refined by the Mamba-Transformer hybrid architectures in both the UFE and CMF modules, dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and global semantic information for complex spatial contexts. A boundary-wise loss function is employed as the segmentation loss of the proposed MMTSeg to minimize boundary discrepancies for a distance-based metric. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed feature enhancement and fusion modules in the proposed network and the Transformer with Mamba block for improving the performance of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMTSeg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods when modalities are missing.

Title: Radiance Fields from Photons
Authors: Sacha Jungerman, Aryan Garg, Mohit Gupta
Abstract: Neural radiance fields, or NeRFs, have become the de facto approach for high-quality view synthesis from a collection of images captured from multiple viewpoints. However, many issues remain when capturing images in-the-wild under challenging conditions, such as low light, high dynamic range, or rapid motion leading to smeared reconstructions with noticeable artifacts. In this work, we introduce quanta radiance fields, a novel class of neural radiance fields that are trained at the granularity of individual photons using single-photon cameras (SPCs). We develop theory and practical computational techniques for building radiance fields and estimating dense camera poses from unconventional, stochastic, and high-speed binary frame sequences captured by SPCs. We demonstrate, both via simulations and a SPC hardware prototype, high-fidelity reconstructions under high-speed motion, in low light, and for extreme dynamic range settings.

Title: From Darkness to Detail: Frequency-Aware SSMs for Low-Light Vision
Authors: Eashan Adhikarla, Kai Zhang, Gong Chen, John Nicholson, Brian D. Davison
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a persistent challenge in computer vision, where state-of-the-art models are often hampered by hardware constraints and computational inefficiency, particularly at high resolutions. While foundational architectures like transformers and diffusion models have advanced the field, their computational complexity limits their deployment on edge devices. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates a frequency-aware state-space model within a modified U-Net. ExpoMamba is designed to address mixed-exposure challenges by decoupling the modeling of amplitude (intensity) and phase (structure) in the frequency domain. This allows for targeted enhancement, making it highly effective for real-time applications, including downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ExpoMamba is up to 2-3x faster than competing models and achieves a 6.8\% PSNR improvement, establishing a new state-of-the-art in efficient, high-quality low-light enhancement.

Title: Joint Bayesian Parameter and Model Order Estimation for Low-Rank Probability Mass Tensors
Authors: Joseph K. Chege, Arie Yeredor, Martin Haardt
Abstract: Obtaining a reliable estimate of the joint probability mass function (PMF) of a set of random variables from observed data is a significant objective in statistical signal processing and machine learning. Modelling the joint PMF as a tensor that admits a low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has enabled the development of efficient PMF estimation algorithms. However, these algorithms require the rank (model order) of the tensor to be specified beforehand. In real-world applications, the true rank is unknown. Therefore, an appropriate rank is usually selected from a candidate set either by observing validation errors or by computing various likelihood-based information criteria, a procedure which is computationally expensive for large datasets. This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework for estimating the joint PMF and automatically inferring its rank from observed data. We specify a Bayesian PMF estimation model and employ appropriate prior distributions for the model parameters, allowing for tuning-free rank inference via a single training run. We then derive a deterministic solution based on variational inference (VI) to approximate the posterior distributions of various model parameters. Additionally, we develop a scalable version of the VI-based approach by leveraging stochastic variational inference (SVI) to arrive at an efficient algorithm whose complexity scales sublinearly with the size of the dataset. Numerical experiments involving both synthetic data and real movie recommendation data illustrate the advantages of our VI and SVI-based methods in terms of estimation accuracy, automatic rank detection, and computational efficiency.

Title: Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models
Authors: Xinkai Liu, Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, Li Qiao, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Mehdi Bennis
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.

Title: Goal-oriented Semantic Communication for Robot Arm Reconstruction in Digital Twin: Feature and Temporal Selections
Authors: Shutong Chen, Emmanouil Spyrakos-Papastavridis, Yichao Jin, Yansha Deng
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies in industry, the Digital Twin (DT) facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analysis for real-world systems by precisely reconstructing virtual replicas of physical entities. However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the everincreasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case. The demo is available at: this https URL.

Title: Data-Driven Distributed Optimization via Aggregative Tracking and Deep-Learning
Authors: Riccardo Brumali, Guido Carnevale, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In detail, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, a scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup where each objective function is unknown and can be sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from users or sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm combining three components: (i) a learning part leveraging neural networks to learn the local costs descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine steering the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism locally reconstructing the unavailable global quantities. Using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that in strongly convex setups, the distributed scheme linearly converges to a neighborhood of the optimum, whose radius depends on the accuracy of the neural networks. Finally, numerical simulations validate the theoretical results.

Title: An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function
Authors: Nicolas Gillis, Margherita Porcelli, Giovanni Seraghiti
Abstract: ReLU matrix decomposition (RMD) is the following problem: given a sparse, nonnegative matrix $X$ and a factorization rank $r$, identify a rank-$r$ matrix $\Theta$ such that $X\approx \max(0,\Theta)$. RMD is a particular instance of nonlinear matrix decomposition (NMD) that finds application in data compression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold learning. The standard RMD model minimizes the least squares error, that is, $\|X - \max(0,\Theta)\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem, Least-Squares RMD (LS-RMD), is nondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an alternative model, \revise{dubbed Latent-RMD}, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced and satisfies $\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\|Z - \Theta\|_F^2$ (``A nonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J.\ Math.\ Data Sci., 2022). Our first contribution is to show that the two formulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\Theta$. We then consider a reparametrization of the Latent-RMD, called 3B-RMD, in which $\Theta$ is substituted by a low-rank product $WH$, where $W$ has $r$ columns and $H$ has $r$ rows. Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block coordinate descent (BCD) approach applied to 3B-RMD. Our third contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD, dubbed eBCD, which we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions. We illustrate the significant acceleration effect of eBCD compared to eBCD, and also show that eBCD performs well against the state of the art on synthetic and real-world data sets.

Title: Constrained Parameter Update Law for Adaptive Control
Authors: Ashwin P. Dani
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.

Title: Large-Scale Bayesian Tensor Reconstruction: An Approximate Message Passing Solution
Authors: Bingyang Cheng, Zhongtao Chen, Yichen Jin, Hao Zhang, Chen Zhang, Edmund Y. Lam, Yik-Chung Wu
Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.

Title: uPVC-Net: A Universal Premature Ventricular Contraction Detection Deep Learning Algorithm
Authors: Hagai Hamami, Yosef Solewicz, Daniel Zur, Yonatan Kleerekoper, Joachim A. Behar
Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

Title: Adaptable Symbolic Music Infilling with MIDI-RWKV
Authors: Christian Zhou-Zheng, Philippe Pasquier
Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has mostly focused on end-to-end systems that generate either entire compositions or continuations of pieces, which are difficult for composers to iterate on. The area of computer-assisted composition, where generative models integrate into existing creative workflows, remains comparatively underexplored. In this study, we address the tasks of model style adaptation and multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a small foundation model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for style adaptation in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics with respect to existing models, and release model weights and code at this https URL.

Title: Derandomizing Simultaneous Confidence Regions for Band-Limited Functions by Improved Norm Bounds and Majority-Voting Schemes
Authors: Balázs Csanád Csáji, Bálint Horváth
Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through numerical experiments.

Title: Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment for Generative Semantic Communications of AIGC Images
Authors: Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated images, its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional image data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the image generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and condition-aware low-rank adaptation (CALA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while CALA enables efficient adaptation to diverse rate requirements and channel conditions. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the consistency between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44% and enahnces the average transmission quality in terms of PSNR by 6.5 dB over the baselines without knowledge alignment.

Title: From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Yuhang Jia, Xu Zhang, Yujie Guo, Yang Chen, Shiwan Zhao
Abstract: Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.

Title: How Does a Deep Neural Network Look at Lexical Stress in English Words?
Authors: Itai Allouche, Itay Asael, Rotem Rousso, Vered Dassa, Ann Bradlow, Seung-Eun Kim, Matthew Goldrick, Joseph Keshet
Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

Title: NeuroKoop: Neural Koopman Fusion of Structural-Functional Connectomes for Identifying Prenatal Drug Exposure in Adolescents
Authors: Badhan Mazumder, Aline Kotoski, Vince D. Calhoun, Dong Hye Ye
Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge, complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

Title: Vision-Proprioception Fusion with Mamba2 in End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Motion Control
Authors: Xiaowen Tao, Yinuo Wang, Jinzhao Zhou
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for motion control trains policies directly from sensor inputs to motor commands, enabling unified controllers for different robots and tasks. However, most existing methods are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context. We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations (e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for resource-constrained robotic and autonomous systems in engineering informatics applications.

Title: DISPATCH: Distilling Selective Patches for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Dohwan Kim, Jung-Woo Choi
Abstract: In speech enhancement, knowledge distillation (KD) compresses models by transferring a high-capacity teacher's knowledge to a compact student. However, conventional KD methods train the student to mimic the teacher's output entirely, which forces the student to imitate the regions where the teacher performs poorly and to apply distillation to the regions where the student already performs well, which yields only marginal gains. We propose Distilling Selective Patches (DISPatch), a KD framework for speech enhancement that applies the distillation loss to spectrogram patches where the teacher outperforms the student, as determined by a Knowledge Gap Score. This approach guides optimization toward areas with the most significant potential for student improvement while minimizing the influence of regions where the teacher may provide unreliable instruction. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Scale Selective Patches (MSSP), a frequency-dependent method that uses different patch sizes across low- and high-frequency bands to account for spectral heterogeneity. We incorporate DISPatch into conventional KD methods and observe consistent gains in compact students. Moreover, integrating DISPatch and MSSP into a state-of-the-art frequency-dependent KD method considerably improves performance across all metrics.

Title: Sidon: Fast and Robust Open-Source Multilingual Speech Restoration for Large-scale Dataset Cleansing
Authors: Wataru Nakata, Yuki Saito, Yota Ueda, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.

Title: Networks of Causal Abstractions: A Sheaf-theoretic Framework
Authors: Gabriele D'Acunto, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Sergio Barbarossa
Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to improve explainability, robustness, and trustworthiness by leveraging causal models. Recent work has shown that sheaf-theoretic approaches offer a principled framework for representing and aligning causal knowledge across collections of subjective and imperfect causal models connected by relational structures. In this work, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a general sheaf-theoretic framework for representing, learning, and reasoning across collections of mixture causal models (MCMs). CAN formalizes causal abstraction relations among subjective MCMs operating at different levels of granularity, while remaining agnostic to explicit causal graphs, functional mechanisms, interventional data, or jointly sampled observations. At the theoretical level, we provide a categorical formulation of MCMs and characterize key properties of CANs, including consistency, smoothness, and the existence of global sections, which are related to spectral properties of an associated combinatorial Laplacian. At the methodological level, we address the problem of learning consistent CANs from data by exploiting the compositionality of causal abstractions and necessary conditions for their existence. The learning task decomposes into local problems on the network edges, for which we propose efficient solutions in Gaussian and Gaussian mixture settings. We validate the proposed learning methods on synthetic data and illustrate the practical relevance of the CAN framework through a financial application, demonstrating both recovery and counterfactual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research.

Title: Probing the Hidden Talent of ASR Foundation Models for L2 English Oral Assessment
Authors: Fu-An Chao, Bi-Cheng Yan, Berlin Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

Title: Data-Augmented Deep Learning for Downhole Depth Sensing and Validation
Authors: Si-Yu Xiao, Xin-Di Zhao, Tian-Hao Mao, Yi-Wei Wang, Yu-Qiao Chen, Hong-Yun Zhang, Jian Wang, Jun-Jie Wang, Shuang Liu, Tu-Pei Chen, Yang Liu
Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network has achieved significant progress in collar recognition, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into a downhole toolstring for CCL log acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. Comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation are proposed, and their effectiveness is evaluated using baseline neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across diverse configurations, the contribution of each augmentation method is analyzed. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing, and random cropping are fundamental prerequisites for model training, while label smoothing regularization, time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capabilities. Incorporating the proposed augmentation methods into the two baseline models results in maximum F1 score improvements of 0.027 and 0.024 for the TAN and MAN models, respectively. Furthermore, applying these techniques yields F1 score gains of up to 0.045 for the TAN model and 0.057 for the MAN model compared to prior studies. Performance evaluation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the existing gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models under CCL data-limited conditions, and provides a technical foundation for the future automation of downhole operations.

Title: Stabilizing Policy Gradient Methods via Reward Profiling
Authors: Shihab Ahmed, El Houcine Bergou, Aritra Dutta, Yue Wang
Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Title: Beyond Expected Goals: A Probabilistic Framework for Shot Occurrences in Soccer
Authors: Jonathan Pipping-Gamón, Tianshu Feng, R. Paul Sabin
Abstract: Expected goals (xG) models estimate the probability that a shot results in a goal from its context (e.g., location, pressure), but they operate only on observed shots. We propose xG+, a possession-level framework that first estimates the probability that a shot occurs within the next second and its corresponding xG if it were to occur. We also introduce ways to aggregate this joint probability estimate over the course of a possession. By jointly modeling shot-taking behavior and shot quality, xG+ remedies the conditioning-on-shots limitation of standard xG. We show that this improves predictive accuracy at the team level and produces a more persistent player skill signal than standard xG models.

Title: RRPO: Robust Reward Policy Optimization for LLM-based Emotional TTS
Authors: Cong Wang, Changfeng Gao, Yang Xiang, Zhihao Du, Keyu An, Han Zhao, Qian Chen, Xiangang Li, Yingming Gao, Ya Li
Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

Title: Extragradient methods with complexity guarantees for hierarchical variational inequalities
Authors: Pavel Dvurechensky, Meggie Marschner, Shimrit Shtern, Mathias Staudigl
Abstract: In the framework of a real Hilbert space we consider the problem of approaching solutions to a class of hierarchical variational inequality problems, subsuming several other problem classes including certain mathematical programs under equilibrium constraints, constrained min-max problems, hierarchical game problems, optimal control under VI constraints, and simple bilevel optimization problems. For this general problem formulation, we establish rates of convergence in terms of suitably constructed gap functions, measuring feasibility gaps and optimality gaps. We present worst-case iteration complexity results on both levels of the variational problem, as well as weak convergence under a geometric weak sharpness condition on the lower level solution set. Our results match and improve the state of the art in terms of their iteration complexity and the generality of the problem formulation.

Title: Mathematical Foundations of Polyphonic Music Generation via Structural Inductive Bias
Authors: Joonwon Seo
Abstract: This monograph introduces a novel approach to polyphonic music generation by addressing the "Missing Middle" problem through structural inductive bias. Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Title: Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage
Authors: Yifeng Qin, Jing Chen, Zhi Hao Jiang, Zhi Ning Chen, Yongming Huang, Lingyang Song
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.

Title: Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease
Authors: Samuel D. Anderson, Nikhil N. Chaudhari, Nahian F. Chowdhury, Jordan Jomsky, Xiaoyu Rayne Zheng, Andrei Irimia, Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

Title: Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings
Authors: Yinan Li, Hasti Seifi
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.

Title: Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti
Abstract: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.

Title: Improve the autonomy of the SE2(3) group based Extended Kalman Filter for Integrated Navigation: Application
Authors: Maosong Wang, Jiarui Cui, Wenqi Wu, Peiqi Li, Xianfei Pan
Abstract: One of the core advantages of SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. In the previous paper, the theoretical analysis of autonomy property of navigation model in inertial, earth and world frames was given. A construction method for SE2(3) group navigation model is proposed to improve the non-inertial navigation model toward full autonomy. This paper serves as a counterpart to previous paper and conducts the real-world strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/odometer(ODO) experiments as well as Monte-Carlo simulations to demonstrate the performance of improved SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models.
