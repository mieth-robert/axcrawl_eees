Title: Signal and Noise Classification in Bio-Signals via unsupervised Machine Learning
Authors: Sansrit Paudel
Abstract: Real-world biosignal data is frequently corrupted by various types of noise, such as motion artifacts, and baseline wander. Although digital signal processing techniques exist to process such signals; however, heavily degraded signals cannot be recovered. In this study, we aim to classify two things: first, a binary classification of noisy and clean biosignals, and next, to categorize various kinds of noise such as motion artifacts, sensor failure, etc. We implemented K-means clustering, and our results indicate that the algorithm can most reliably group clean segments from noisy ones, particularly strong performance in identifying clean data compared to various categories of noise. This approach enables the selection of only high-quality bio-signal segments and provides accurate results for feature engineering that may enhance the precision of machine learning models trained on biosignals.

Title: Sensor Attack Detection Method for Encrypted State Observers
Authors: Yeongjun Jang, Sangwon Lee, Junsoo Kim
Abstract: This paper proposes an encrypted state observer that is capable of detecting sensor attacks without decryption. We first design a state observer that operates over a finite field of integers with the modular arithmetic. The observer generates a residue signal that indicates the presence of attacks under sparse attack and sensing redundancy conditions. Then, we develop a homomorphic encryption scheme that enables the observer to operate over encrypted data while automatically disclosing the residue signal. Unlike our previous work restricted to single-input single-output systems, the proposed scheme is applicable to general multi-input multi-output systems. Given that the disclosed residue signal remains below a prescribed threshold, the full state can be recovered as an encrypted message.

Title: Learning Dynamics from Infrequent Output Measurements for Uncertainty-Aware Optimal Control
Authors: Robert Lefringhausen, Theodor Springer, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Reliable optimal control is challenging when the dynamics of a nonlinear system are unknown and only infrequent, noisy output measurements are available. This work addresses this setting of limited sensing by formulating a Bayesian prior over the continuous-time dynamics and latent state trajectory in state-space form and updating it through a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler equipped with a numerical ODE integrator. The resulting posterior samples are used to formulate a scenario-based optimal control problem that accounts for both model and measurement uncertainty and is solved using standard nonlinear programming methods. The approach is validated in a numerical case study on glucose regulation using a Type 1 diabetes model.

Title: Cabin Layout, Seat Density, and Passenger Segmentation in Air Transport: Implications for Prices, Ancillary Revenues, and Efficiency
Authors: Alessandro V.M. Oliveira, Moises D. Vassallo
Abstract: This study investigates how the layout and density of seats in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.

Title: Polarization-Diversity-Based Rotation Sensing Methodology Using COTS UHF RFID Tags
Authors: Florian Muralter, Fabian Muralter, Hugo Landaluce, Asier Perallos
Abstract: Phase-based sensing using ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) has, in recent years, yielded numerous additions to the Internet of Things (IoT). This work presents a polarization diversity-based rotation sensing methodology using common-off-the-shelf (COTS) UHF RFID tags identified with a software-defined radio (SDR) UHF RFID reader. The proposed methodology uses the tag-to-reader message after fully coherent demodulation to calculate a difference signal of the backscatter load modulation states. This sequence is then used to compute the rotation speed by evaluating its phase change over time. Experimental results are used to validate the theoretical model and to evaluate the performance and limitations of the proposed system.

Title: Mitigation of Datacenter Demand Ramping and Fluctuation using Hybrid ESS and Supercapacitor
Authors: Min-Seung Ko, Jae Woong Shim, Hao Zhu
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)-based control framework that enables comprehensive power smoothing for hyperscale AI datacenters with large load variations. Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles.

Title: Missing Wedge Inpainting and Joint Alignment in Electron Tomography through Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Cedric Lim, Corneel Casert, Arthur R. C. McCray, Serin Lee, Andrew Barnum, Jennifer Dionne, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Electron tomography is a powerful tool for understanding the morphology of materials in three dimensions, but conventional reconstruction algorithms typically suffer from missing-wedge artifacts and data misalignment imposed by experimental constraints. Recently proposed supervised machine-learning-enabled reconstruction methods to address these challenges rely on training data and are therefore difficult to generalize across materials systems. We propose a fully self-supervised implicit neural representation (INR) approach using a neural network as a regularizer. Our approach enables fast inline alignment through pose optimization, missing wedge inpainting, and denoising of low dose datasets via model regularization using only a single dataset. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data and show that it produces high-quality tomograms from diverse and information limited datasets. Our results show that INR-based self-supervised reconstructions offer high fidelity reconstructions with minimal user input and preprocessing, and can be readily applied to a wide variety of materials samples and experimental parameters.

Title: FlowSteer: Conditioning Flow Field for Consistent Image Restoration
Authors: Tharindu Wickremasinghe, Chenyang Qi, Harshana Weligampola, Zhengzhong Tu, Stanley H. Chan
Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image (T2I) models excel at prompt-driven image generation, but falter on Image Restoration (IR), often "drifting away" from being faithful to the measurement. Prior work mitigate this drift with data-specific flows or task-specific adapters that are computationally heavy and not scalable across tasks. This raises the question "Can't we efficiently manipulate the existing generative capabilities of a flow model?" To this end, we introduce FlowSteer (FS), an operator-aware conditioning scheme that injects measurement priors along the sampling path,coupling a frozed flow's implicit guidance with explicit measurement constraints. Across super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, and colorization, FS improves measurement consistency and identity preservation in a strictly zero-shot setting-no retrained models, no adapters. We show how the nature of flow models and their sensitivities to noise inform the design of such a scheduler. FlowSteer, although simple, achieves a higher fidelity of reconstructed images, while leveraging the rich generative priors of flow models.

Title: A Dynamic Coding Scheme to Prevent Covert Cyber-Attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Mahdi Taheri, Khashayar Khorasani, Nader Meskin
Abstract: In this paper, we address two main problems in the context of covert cyber-attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS). First, we aim to investigate and develop necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of disruption resources of the CPS that enable adversaries to execute covert cyber-attacks. These conditions can be utilized to identify the input and output communication channels that are needed by adversaries to execute these attacks. Second, this paper introduces and develops a dynamic coding scheme as a countermeasure against covert cyber-attacks. Under certain conditions and assuming the existence of one secure input and two secure output communication channels, the proposed dynamic coding scheme prevents adversaries from executing covert cyber-attacks. A numerical case study of a flight control system is provided to demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed and developed dynamic coding scheme.

Title: Millimeter-Wave True-Time Delay Array Beamforming with Robustness to Mobility
Authors: Benjamin W. Domae, Ibrahim Pehlivan, Danijela Cabric
Abstract: Ultra-reliable and low-latency connectivity is required for real-time and latency-sensitive applications, like wireless augmented and virtual reality streaming. Millimeter-wave (mmW) networks have enabled extremely high data rates through large available bandwidths but struggle to maintain continuous connectivity with mobile users. Achieving the required beamforming gain from large antenna arrays with minimal disruption is particularly challenging with fast-moving users and practical analog mmW array architectures. In this work, we propose frequency-dependent slanted beams from true-time delay (TTD) analog arrays to achieve robust beamforming in wideband, multi-user downlink scenarios. Novel beams with linear angle-frequency relationships for different users and sub-bands provide a trade-off between instantaneous capacity and angular coverage. Compared to alternative analog array beamforming designs, slanted beams provide higher reliability to angle offsets and greater adaptability to varied user movement statistics.

Title: Integrating Delay-Absorption Capability into Flight Departure Delay Prediction
Authors: Jianyang Zhou
Abstract: Accurately forecasting flight departure delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and mitigating the cascading disruptions that propagate through tightly coupled aircraft rotations. Traditional machine learning approaches often treat upstream delays as static variables, overlooking the dynamic recovery processes that determine whether a delay is absorbed or transmitted to subsequent legs. This study introduces a two-stage machine learning framework that explicitly models delay-absorption behavior and incorporates it into downstream delay prediction. In Stage I, a CatBoost classifier estimates the probability that a flight successfully absorbs an upstream delay based on operational, temporal, and meteorological features. This probability, termed AbsorbScore, quantifies airport- and flight-specific resilience to delay propagation. In Stage II, an XGBoost classifier integrates AbsorbScore with schedule, weather, and congestion indicators to predict whether a flight will depart more than 15 minutes late. Using U.S. domestic flight and NOAA weather data from Summer 2023, the proposed framework achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, increasing ROC-AUC from 0.865 to 0.898 and enhancing precision to 89.2% in identifying delayed flights. The results demonstrate that modeling delay absorption as an intermediate mechanism significantly improves predictive performance and yields interpretable insights into airport recovery dynamics, offering a practical foundation for data-driven delay management and proactive operational planning.

Title: Bounding the Minimal Current Harmonic Distortion in Optimal Modulation of Single-Phase Power Converters
Authors: Jared Miller, Petros Karamanakos, Tobias Geyer
Abstract: Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation technique in which a switching signal is computed offline through an optimization process that accounts for selected performance criteria, such as current harmonic distortion. The optimization determines both the switching angles (i.e., switching times) and the pattern structure (i.e., the sequence of voltage levels). This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs

Title: Metasurfaces Enable Active-Like Passive Radar
Authors: Mingyi Li, Jiawen Xu, Hanting Zhao, Xu Zhao, Yan Jin Chen, Tie Jun Cui, Vincenzo Galdi, Lianlin Li
Abstract: Passive radars (PRs) provide a low-cost and energy-efficient approach to object detection by reusing existing wireless transmissions instead of emitting dedicated probing signals. Yet, conventional passive systems require prior knowledge of non-cooperative source waveforms, are vulnerable to strong interference, and rely on Doppler signatures, limiting their ability to detect subtle or slow-moving targets. Here, we introduce a metasurface-enabled PR (MEPR) concept that integrates a space-time-coding programmable metasurface to imprint distinct spatiotemporal tags onto ambient wireless wavefields. This mechanism transforms a PR into an active-like sensing platform without the need for source control, enabling interference suppression, signal enhancement, and accurate target localization and tracking in cluttered environments. A proof-of-concept implementation operating at 5.48 GHz confirms real-time imaging and tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles under interference-rich conditions, with performance comparable to active radar systems. These results establish MEPR as a solid foundation for scalable, adaptive, and energy-efficient next-generation integrated sensing and communication systems.

Title: Tumor-anchored deep feature random forests for out-of-distribution detection in lung cancer segmentation
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cancerous lesions from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and response assessment. However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks for safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a plug-and-play and lightweight post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone encoder, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. Hence, it scales to images of varying fields-of-view. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 1,916 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC > 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC > 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches. RF-Deep maintained similar performance consistency across networks of different depths and pretraining strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic approach to enhance the reliability of tumor segmentation from CT volumes.

Title: 1024-Channel 0.8V 23.9-nW/Channel Event-based Compute In-memory Neural Spike Detector
Authors: Ye Ke, Zhengnan Fu, Junyi Yang, Hongyang Shang, Arindam Basu
Abstract: The increasing data rate has become a major issue confronting next-generation intracortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). The scaling number of recording sites requires complex analog wiring and lead to huge digitization power consumption. Compressive event-based neural frontends have been used in high-density neural implants to support the simultaneous recording of more channels. Event-based frontends (EBF) convert recorded signals into asynchronous digital events via delta modulation and can inherently achieve considerable compression. But EBFs are prone to false events that do not correspond to neural spikes. Spike detection (SPD) is a key process in the iBMI pipeline to detect neural spikes and further reduce the data rate. However, conventional digital SPD suffers from the increasing buffer size and frequent memory access power, and conventional spike emphasizers are not compatible with EBFs. In this work we introduced an event-based spike detection (Ev-SPD) algorithm for scalable compressive EBFs. To implement the algorithm effectively, we proposed a novel low-power 10-T eDRAM-SRAM hybrid random-access memory in-memory computing bitcell for event processing. We fabricated the proposed 1024-channel IMC SPD macro in a 65nm process and tested the macro with both synthetic dataset and Neuropixel recordings. The proposed macro achieved a high spike detection accuracy of 96.06% on a synthetic dataset and 95.08% similarity and 0.05 firing pattern MAE on Neuropixel recordings. Our event-based IMC SPD macro achieved a high per channel spike detection energy efficiency of 23.9 nW per channel and an area efficiency of 375 um^2 per channel. Our work presented a SPD scheme compatible with compressive EBFs for high-density iBMIs, achieving ultra-low power consumption with an IMC architecture while maintaining considerable accuracy.

Title: Geometry-Aligned Differential Privacy for Location-Safe Federated Radio Map Construction
Authors: Jijia Tian, Wangqian Chen, Junting Chen, Pooi-Yuen Kam
Abstract: Radio maps that describe spatial variations in wireless signal strength are widely used to optimize networks and support aerial platforms. Their construction requires location-labeled signal measurements from distributed users, raising fundamental concerns about location privacy. Even when raw data are kept local, the shared model updates can reveal user locations through their spatial structure, while naive noise injection either fails to hide this leakage or degrades model accuracy. This work analyzes how location leakage arises from gradients in a virtual-environment radio map model and proposes a geometry-aligned differential privacy mechanism with heterogeneous noise tailored to both confuse localization and cover gradient spatial patterns. The approach is theoretically supported with a convergence guarantee linking privacy strength to learning accuracy. Numerical experiments show the approach increases attacker localization error from 30 m to over 180 m, with only 0.2 dB increase in radio map construction error compared to a uniform-noise baseline.

Title: Theoretical Studies of Sub-THz Active Split-Ring Resonators for Near-Field Imaging
Authors: Ali Ameri, Jun-Chau Chien, Ali M. Niknejad
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework for the design of Active Split-Ring Resonators (ASRRs). An ASRR is a Split-Ring Resonator (SRR) equipped with a tunable negative resistor, enabling both switchability and quality factor boosting and tuning. These properties make ASRRs well-suited for integration into dense arrays on silicon chips, where pixelated near-fields are generated and leveraged for high-resolution 2D imaging of samples. Such imagers pave the way for real-time, non-invasive, and low-cost imaging of human body tissue. The paper investigates ASRR coupling to host transmission lines, nonlinear effects, signal flow, and the influence of various noise sources on detection performance. Verified through simulations, these studies provide design guidelines for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and power consumption of a single pixel, while adhering to the constraints of a scalable array.

Title: Formation and Investigation of Cooperative Platooning at the Early Stage of Connected and Automated Vehicles Deployment
Authors: Zeyu Mu, Sergei S. Avedisov, Ahmadreza Moradipari, B. Brian Park
Abstract: Cooperative platooning, enabled by cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), is a cornerstone technology for connected automated vehicles (CAVs), offering significant improvements in safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency over traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow.

Title: An Adaptive Method for Target Curve Selection
Authors: Gabriele Ravizza, Julián Villegas, Christer P. Volk, Tore Stegenborg-Andersen, Yan Pei
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the "Interactive Differential Evolution" (IDE) algorithm to the audio domain for the task of identifying the preferred over-the-ear headphone frequency response target among consumers. The method is based on data collection using an adaptive paired rating listening test paradigm (paired comparison with a scale). The IDE algorithm and its parameters are explained in detail. Additionally, data collected from three listening experiments with more than 20 consumers is presented, and the algorithm's performance in this untested domain is investigated on the basis of two convergence measures. The results indicate that this method can converge and may ease the task of 'extracting' frequency response preference from untrained consumers.

Title: BUT Systems for Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection in the ESDD 2026 Challenge
Authors: Junyi Peng, Lin Zhang, Jin Li, Oldrich Plchot, Jan Cernocky
Abstract: This paper describes the BUT submission to the ESDD 2026 Challenge, specifically focusing on Track 1: Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection with Unseen Generators. To address the critical challenge of generalizing to audio generated by unseen synthesis algorithms, we propose a robust ensemble framework leveraging diverse Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of general audio SSL models (including BEATs, EAT, and Dasheng) and speech-specific SSLs. These front-ends are coupled with a lightweight Multi-Head Factorized Attention (MHFA) back-end to capture discriminative representations. Furthermore, we introduce a feature domain augmentation strategy based on distribution uncertainty modeling to enhance model robustness against unseen spectral distortions. All models are trained exclusively on the official EnvSDD data, without using any external resources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: our best single system achieved Equal Error Rates (EER) of 0.00\%, 4.60\%, and 4.80\% on the Development, Progress (Track 1), and Final Evaluation sets, respectively. The fusion system further improved generalization, yielding EERs of 0.00\%, 3.52\%, and 4.38\% across the same partitions.

Title: Self-Alignment Resonant Beam Empowers Beamforming without Estimation and Control for 6G IoT
Authors: Yixuan Guo, Mingliang Xiong, Qingwen Liu
Abstract: The integration of communication, sensing, and wireless power transfer (WPT) is a cornerstone of 6G intelligent IoT. However, relying on traditional beamforming imposes prohibitive overheads due to complex channel state information (CSI) estimation and active beam scanning, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the radio frequency resonant beam system (RF-RBS), a native physical-layer paradigm that circumvents these limitations. By deploying retro-directive antenna arrays (RAA) at transceivers, RF-RBS establishes a self-sustaining cyclic electromagnetic loop. This mechanism inherently enables self-aligning, high-gain beamforming through positive feedback, eliminating the reliance on digital CSI processing. We analyze the system's architecture and its capability to support high-efficiency WPT, robust communication, and millimeter-level passive positioning. Finally, we evaluate the implementation challenges and strategic value of RF-RBS in latency-sensitive 6G scenarios, including unmanned systems and industrial automation.

Title: Hybrid Fuzzy Logic and Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization for Dynamic Photovoltaic Shading Faults Mitigation
Authors: F. Philibert Andriniriniaimalaza, Nour Mohammad Murad (PIMENT), George Balan, Habachi Bilal (SPE), Nirilalaina Randriatefison, Abdel Khoodaruth, Charles Bernard Andrianirina, Blaise Ravelo (NUIST)
Abstract: Shading faults remain one of the most critical challenges affecting photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, as they not only reduce power generation but also disturb maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\&O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions.

Title: Beyond Wave Variables: A Data-Driven Ensemble Approach for Enhanced Teleoperation Transparency and Stability
Authors: Nour Mitiche, Farid Ferguene, Mourad Oussalah
Abstract: Time delays in communication channels present significant challenges for bilateral teleoperation systems, affecting both transparency and stability. Although traditional wave variable-based methods for a four-channel architecture ensure stability via passivity, they remain vulnerable to wave reflections and disturbances like variable delays and environmental noise. This article presents a data-driven hybrid framework that replaces the conventional wave-variable transform with an ensemble of three advanced sequence models, each optimized separately via the state-of-the-art Optuna optimizer, and combined through a stacking meta-learner. The base predictors include an LSTM augmented with Prophet for trend correction, an LSTM-based feature extractor paired with clustering and a random forest for improved regression, and a CNN-LSTM model for localized and long-term dynamics. Experimental validation was performed in Python using data generated from the baseline system implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that our optimized ensemble achieves a transparency comparable to the baseline wave-variable system under varying delays and noise, while ensuring stability through passivity constraints.

Title: Learned iterative networks: An operator learning perspective
Authors: Andreas Hauptmann, Ozan Öktem
Abstract: Learned image reconstruction has become a pillar in computational imaging and inverse problems. Among the most successful approaches are learned iterative networks, which are formulated by unrolling classical iterative optimisation algorithms for solving variational problems. While the underlying algorithm is usually formulated in the functional analytic setting, learned approaches are often viewed as purely discrete. In this chapter we present a unified operator view for learned iterative networks. Specifically, we formulate a learned reconstruction operator, defining how to compute, and separately the learning problem, which defines what to compute. In this setting we present common approaches and show that many approaches are closely related in their core. We review linear as well as nonlinear inverse problems in this framework and present a short numerical study to conclude.

Title: MPC for tracking for anesthesia dynamics
Authors: Maxim Raymond, Kaouther Moussa, Mirko Fiacchini, Jimmy Lauber
Abstract: In this paper, an MPC for tracking formulation is proposed for the control of anesthesia dynamics. It seamlessly enables the optimization of the steady-states pair that is not unique due to the MISO nature of the model. Anesthesia dynamics is a multi-time scale system with two types of states characterized, respectively, by fast and slow dynamics. In anesthesia control, the output equation depends only on the fast dynamics. Therefore, the slow states can be treated as disturbances, and compensation terms can be introduced. Subsequently, the system can be reformulated as a nominal one allowing the design of an MPC for tracking strategy. The presented framework ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability, through the design of appropriate terminal ingredients in the MPC for tracking framework. The controller performance is then assessed on a patient in a simulation environment.

Title: Quantization and Security Parameter Design for Overflow-Free Confidential FRIT
Authors: Jungjin Park, Osamu Kaneko, Kiminao Kogiso
Abstract: This study proposes a systematic design procedure for determining the quantization gain and the security parameter in the Confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (CFRIT), enabling overflow-free and accuracy-guaranteed encrypted controller tuning. Within an encrypted data-driven gain tuning, the range of quantization errors induced during the encoding (encryption) process can be estimated from operational data. Based on this insight, explicit analytical conditions on the quantization gain and the security parameter are derived to prevent overflow in computing over encrypted data. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a quantitative relationship between quantization-induced errors and the deviation between the gains obtained by CFRIT and non-confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT), clarifying how parameter choice affects tuning accuracy. A numerical example verifies the proposed procedure by demonstrating that the designed parameters achieve accurate encrypted tuning within a prescribed tolerance while preventing overflow. In addition, the admissible region of parameter combinations is visualized to examine the characteristics of feasible and infeasible regions, providing practical insights into parameter design for encrypted data-driven control.

Title: High-performance computing enabled contingency analysis for modern power networks
Authors: Alexandre Gracia-Calvo, Francesca Rossi, Eduardo Iraola, Juan Carlos Olives-Camps, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo
Abstract: Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments.

Title: Aliasing in Near-Field Array Ambiguity Functions: a Spatial Frequency-Domain Framework
Authors: Gilles Monnoyer, Jérôme Louveaux, Laurence Defraigne, Baptiste Sambon, Luc vandendorpe
Abstract: Next-generation communication and localization systems increasingly rely on extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays), which promise unprecedented spatial resolution and new functionalities. These gains arise from their inherent operation in the near field (NF) regime, where the spherical nature of the wavefront can no longer be ignored; consequently, characterizing the ambiguity function--which amounts to the matched beam pattern-- is considerably more challenging. Implementing very wide apertures with half-wavelength element spacing is costly and complex. This motivates thinning the array (removing elements), which introduces intricate aliasing structures, i.e., grating lobes. Whereas prior work has addressed this challenge using approximations tailored to specific array geometries, this paper develops a general framework that reveals the fundamental origins and geometric behavior of grating lobes in near-field ambiguity functions. Using a local spatial-frequency analysis of steering signals, we derive a systematic methodology to model NF grating lobes as aliasing artifacts, quantifying their structure on the AF, and providing design guidelines for XL-arrays that operate within aliasing-safe regions. We further connect our framework to established far-field principles. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of the approach by deriving closed-form expressions for aliasing-free regions in canonical uniform linear arrays and uniform circular arrays.

Title: LoS+NLoS Holographic MIMO: Analysis and Application of Wavenumber-Division Multiplexing
Authors: Ashutosh Prajapati, Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa, Marco Di Renzo, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) enables electrically large continuous apertures, overcoming the physical scaling limits of conventional MIMO architectures with half-wavelength spacing. Their near-field operating regime requires channel models that jointly capture line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components in a physically consistent manner. Existing studies typically treat these components separately or rely on environment-specific multipath models. In this work, we develop a unified LoS+NLoS channel representation for holographic lines that integrates spatial-sampling-based and expansion-based formulations. Building on this model, we extend the wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) framework, originally introduced for purely LoS channels, to the LoS+NLoS scenario. Applying WDM to the NLoS component yields its angular-domain representation, enabling direct characterization through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further derive closed-form characterizations for isotropic and non-isotropic scattering, with the former recovering Jakes' isotropic model. Lastly, we evaluate the resulting degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity, showing that incorporating the NLoS component substantially improves the performance relative to the purely LoS case.

Title: Beyond Diagonal RIS-assisted MIMO Transmission: Beamforming Gain and Capacity Optimization
Authors: Ainna Yue Moreno-Locubiche, Josep Vidal
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology in wireless communications, offering unprecedented control over signal propagation. This study focuses on passive beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which has been proposed to generalize conventional diagonal RIS, in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) downlink (DL) communication systems. We compare the performance of transmit beamforming (TxBF) and MIMO capacity transmission with waterfilling power allocation in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, where propagation primarily occurs under line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. In the lack of closed-form expressions for the optimal RIS elements in either case, our approach adopts a gradient-based optimization approach requiring lower complexity than the solution in arXiv:2406.02170. Numerical results reveal that BD-RIS significantly outperforms traditional diagonal RIS in terms of spectral efficiency and coverage

Title: Optimal Control of Behavioral-Feedback SIR Epidemic Model
Authors: Martina Alutto, Leonardo Cianfanelli, Giacomo Como, Fabio Fagnani, Francesca Parise
Abstract: We consider a behavioral-feedback SIR epidemic model, in which the infection rate depends in feedback on the fractions of susceptible and infected agents, respectively. The considered model allows one to account for endogenous adaptation mechanisms of the agents in response to the epidemics, such as voluntary social distancing, or the adoption of face masks. For this model, we formulate an optimal control problem for a social planner that has the ability to reduce the infection rate to keep the infection curve below a certain threshold within an infinite time horizon, while minimizing the intervention cost. Based on the dynamic properties of the model, we prove that, under quite general conditions on the infection rate, the \emph{filling the box} strategy is the optimal control. This strategy consists in letting the epidemics spread without intervention until the threshold is reached, then applying the minimum control that leaves the fraction of infected individuals constantly at the threshold until the reproduction number becomes less than one and the infection naturally fades out. Our result generalizes one available in the literature for the equivalent problem formulated for the classical SIR model, which can be recovered as a special case of our model when the infection rate is constant. Our contribution enhances the understanding of epidemic management with adaptive human behavior, offering insights for robust containment strategies.

Title: Contextual Bandits and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Predictive LTM Handover Decisions
Authors: Ainna Yue Moreno-Locubiche, Josep Vidal, Olga Muñoz-Medina, Margarita Cabrera-Bean
Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of optimizing handover (HO) in next-generation wireless networks by integrating Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), predicting received signal power, and utilizing learning-based decision-making. A conventional reactive HO mechanism, such as lower-layer triggered mobility (LTM), is enhanced through linear prediction to anticipate link degradation. Additionally, the use of RIS helps to mitigate signal blockage and extend coverage. An online trained non-linear Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) agent selects target gNBs based on context features, which reduces unnecessary HO and signaling overhead. Extensive simulations evaluate eight combinations of these techniques under realistic mobility and channel conditions. Results show that CMAB and RSRP prediction consistently reduce the number of HO, ping-pong rate and cell preparations, while RIS improves link reliability.

Title: Decoupled Design of Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions via Equivariances
Authors: Adrian Wiltz, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: This article presents a systematic method for designing time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBF) composed of a time-invariant component and multiple time-dependent components, leveraging structural properties of the system dynamics. The method involves the construction of a specific class of time-invariant CBFs that encode the system's dynamic capabilities with respect to a given constraint, and augments them subsequently with appropriately designed time-dependent transformations. While transformations uniformly varying the time-invariant CBF can be applied to arbitrary systems, transformations exploiting structural properties in the dynamics - equivariances in particular - enable the handling of a broader and more expressive class of time-varying constraints. The article shows how to leverage such properties in the design of time-varying CBFs. The proposed method decouples the design of time variations from the computationally expensive construction of the underlying CBFs, thereby providing a computationally attractive method to the design of time-varying CBFs. The method accounts for input constraints and under-actuation, and requires only qualitative knowledge on the time-variation of the constraints making it suitable to the application in uncertain environments.

Title: NLoS Localization with Single Base Station Based on Radio Map
Authors: Jiajie Xu, Yifan Guo, Xiucheng Wang, Nan Cheng, Tingting Yang
Abstract: Accurate outdoor localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge for wireless communication and sensing systems. Existing methods, including positioning based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and triple Base Stations (BSs) techniques, cannot provide reliable performance under NLoS conditions, particularly in dense urban areas with strong multipath effects. To address this limitation, we propose a single BS localization framework that integrates sequential signal measurements with prior radio information embedded in the Radio Map (RM). Using temporal measurement features and matching them with radio maps, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse impact of multipath propagation and reduces the dependence on LoS paths. Simulation experiments further evaluate the impact of different radio map construction strategies and the varying lengths of the measurement sequence on localization accuracy. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in typical NLoS environments, highlighting its potential as a practical and robust solution for single-base-station deployment.

Title: Direct transfer of optimized controllers to similar systems using dimensionless MPC
Authors: Josip Kir Hromatko, Shambhuraj Sawant, Šandor Ileš, Sébastien Gros
Abstract: Scaled model experiments are commonly used in various engineering fields to reduce experimentation costs and overcome constraints associated with full-scale systems. The relevance of such experiments relies on dimensional analysis and the principle of dynamic similarity. However, transferring controllers to full-scale systems often requires additional tuning. In this paper, we propose a method to enable a direct controller transfer using dimensionless model predictive control, tuned automatically for closed-loop performance. With this reformulation, the closed-loop behavior of an optimized controller transfers directly to a new, dynamically similar system. Additionally, the dimensionless formulation allows for the use of data from systems of different scales during parameter optimization. We demonstrate the method on a cartpole swing-up and a car racing problem, applying either reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization for tuning the controller parameters. Software used to obtain the results in this paper is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Gradient-Informed Monte Carlo Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models for Low-Thrust Trajectory Design
Authors: Jannik Graebner, Ryne Beeson
Abstract: Preliminary mission design of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem is a global search characterized by a complex objective landscape and numerous local minima. Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase.

Title: Applications of Singular Entropy to Signals and Singular Smoothness to Images
Authors: Oscar Romero, Néstor Thome
Abstract: This paper explores signal and image analysis by using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its extension, the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD). A key strength of SVD lies in its ability to separate information into orthogonal subspaces. While SVD is a well-established tool in ECG analysis, particularly for source separation, this work proposes a refined method for selecting a threshold to distinguish between maternal and fetal components more effectively. In the first part of the paper, the focus is onmedical signal analysis,where the concepts of Energy Gap Variation (EGV) and Singular Energy are introduced to isolate fetal and maternal ECG signals, improving the known ones. Furthermore, the approach is significantly enhanced by the application of GSVD, which provides additional discriminative power for more accurate signal separation. The second part introduces a novel technique called Singular Smoothness, developed for image analysis. This method incorporates Singular Entropy and the Frobenius normto evaluate information density, and is applied to the detection of natural anomalies such asmountain fractures and burned forest regions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Title: LaMoSys3.5D: Enabling 3.5D-IC-Based Large Language Model Inference Serving Systems via Hardware/Software Co-Design
Authors: Qipan Wang, Zhe Zhang, Shuangchen Li, Hongzhong Zheng, Zheng Liang, Yibo Lin, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang
Abstract: The success of large language models LLMs amplifies the need for highthroughput energyefficient inference at scale. 3DDRAMbased accelerators provide high memory bandwidth and therefore an opportunity to accelerate the bandwidthbound decode phase. However, how to adequately balance compute density for prefill with bandwidthcapacity for decode remains open. Moreover, most prior designs do not target endtoend serving, leaving the codesign of dataflow, parallel mapping, and scheduling underexplored. To bridge the gap, we present LaMoSys3.5D, to our knowledge the first scalable 3.5DIC architecture for LLM serving. LaMoSys3.5D composes heterogeneous 3DDRAM chiplets on a 2.5D interposer: computerich chiplets for prefill and bandwidthcapacityrich chiplets for decode. To realize efficient serving, we adopt a hardwaresoftware codesign spanning dataflow, parallel mapping, and introduce a thermalaware modeling and hierarchical designspace exploration framework. Across diverse LLMs and workloads, LaMoSys3.5D improves throughputperwatt over DGXA100 systems by 62 and achieves a 4.87 better endtoend latency geomean versus prior 3D designs. We further distill intriguing design guidelines for 3.5DIC architectures and endtoend inference serving.

Title: RF sensing with dense IoT network graphs: An EM-informed analysis
Authors: Federica Fieramosca, Vittorio Rampa, Michele D'Amico, Stefano Savazzi
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing is attracting interest in research, standardization, and industry, especially for its potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By leveraging the properties of the ElectroMagnetic (EM) waves used in wireless networks, RF sensing captures environmental information such as the presence and movement of people and objects, enabling passive localization and vision applications. This paper investigates the theoretical bounds on accuracy and resolution for RF sensing systems within dense networks. It employs an EM model to predict the effects of body blockage in various scenarios. To detect human movements, the paper proposes a deep graph neural network, trained on Received Signal Strength (RSS) samples generated from the EM model. These samples are structured as dense graphs, with nodes representing antennas and edges as radio links. Focusing on the problem of identifying the number of human subjects co-present in a monitored area over time, the paper analyzes the theoretical limits on the number of distinguishable subjects, exploring how these limits depend on factors such as the number of radio links, the size of the monitored area and the subjects physical dimensions. These bounds enable the prediction of the system performance during network pre-deployment stages. The paper also presents the results of an indoor case study, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and confirm the model's predictive potential in the network design stages.

Title: IoT-based Cost-Effective Fruit Quality Monitoring System using Electronic Nose
Authors: Anindya Bhattacharjee, Nittya Ananda Biswas, Khondakar Ashik Shahriar, Kawsain Bin Salim
Abstract: Post-harvest losses due to subjective quality assessment cause significant damage to the economy and food safety, especially in countries like Bangladesh. To mitigate such damages, objective decision-making backed by scientific methods is necessary. An IoT-based, cost-effective quality monitoring system can provide a solution by going beyond subjective quality monitoring and decision-making practices. Here, we propose a low-power, cost-effective fruit quality monitoring system with an array of MQ gas sensors, which can be used as an electronic nose. We track the volatile gas emissions, specifically ethanol, methane, and ammonia, encompassing both ripening and decomposition for a set of bananas. Based on the gas concentration thresholds, we develop a mathematical model to accurately assess fruit quality. We also integrate this information into a dashboard for prompt decision-making and monitoring to make it useful to the farmers. This approach has the potential to reduce economic losses, enhance food safety, and provide scalable solutions for the supply chain.

Title: Evaluating the Deformation Measurement Accuracy Using Low-SNR Radars for Future InSAR Missions
Authors: Emre Havazli, Shadi Oveisgharan, Michael Denbina, Brian Hawkins
Abstract: Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful tool for monitoring surface deformation with high precision. However, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, common in regions with low backscatter, can degrade phase coherence and compromise displacement accuracy. In this study, we quantify the impact of low-SNR conditions on InSAR-derived displacement using L-band UAVSAR data collected over the San Andreas Fault and Greenland ice sheet. We simulate low-SNR conditions by degrading the Noise-Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) to $-15~\mathrm{dB}$ and assess the resulting effects on interferometric coherence, phase unwrapping, and time series inversion. The displacement accuracy of 4mm in single interferogram can be achieved by taking looks for the signal decorrelation of 0.6 and SNR between -9dB to -10dB. Our findings indicate that even under low-SNR conditions, a velocity precision of $0.5~\mathrm{cm/yr}$ can be achieved in comparison to high-SNR conditions. By applying multilooking with an 8x8 window, we significantly improve coherence and eliminate this bias, demonstrating that low-SNR systems can achieve comparable precision to high-SNR systems at the expense of spatial resolution. These results have important implications for the design of future cost-effective SAR missions, such as Surface Deformation and Change (SDC), and the optimization of InSAR processing techniques in challenging environments.

Title: Delay-Oriented Distributed Scheduling with TransGNN
Authors: Boxuan Wen, Junyu Luo
Abstract: Minimizing transmission delay in wireless multi-hop networks is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the complex coupling among interference, queue dynamics, and distributed control. Traditional scheduling algorithms, such as max-weight or queue-length-based policies, primarily aim to optimize throughput but often suffer from high latency, especially in heterogeneous or dynamically changing topologies. Recent learning-based approaches, particularly those employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown promise in capturing spatial interference structures. However, conventional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) remain limited by their local aggregation mechanism and their inability to model long-range dependencies within the conflict graph. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a delay-oriented distributed scheduling framework based on Transformer GNN. The proposed model employs an attention-based graph encoder to generate adaptive per-link utility scores that reflect both queue backlog and interference intensity. A Local Greedy Solver (LGS) then utilizes these utilities to construct a feasible independent set of links for transmission, ensuring distributed and conflict-free scheduling.

Title: A Fast Broadband Beamspace Transformation
Authors: Nakul Singh, Coleman DeLude, Mark Davenport, Justin Romberg
Abstract: We present a new computationally efficient method for multi-beamforming in the broadband setting. Our "fast beamspace transformation" forms $B$ beams from $M$ sensor outputs using a number of operations per sample that scales linearly (to within logarithmic factors) with $M$ when $B\sim M$. While the narrowband version of this transformation can be performed efficiently with a spatial fast Fourier transform, the broadband setting requires coherent processing of multiple array snapshots simultaneously. Our algorithm works by taking $N$ samples off of each of $M$ sensors and encoding the sensor outputs into a set of coefficients using a special non-uniform spaced Fourier transform. From these coefficients, each beam is formed by solving a small system of equations that has Toeplitz structure. The total runtime complexity is $\mathcal{O}(M\log N+B\log N)$ operations per sample, exhibiting essentially the same scaling as in the narrowband case and vastly outperforming broadband beamformers based on delay and sum whose computations scale as $\mathcal{O}(MB)$. Alongside a careful mathematical formulation and analysis of our fast broadband beamspace transform, we provide a host of numerical experiments demonstrating the algorithm's favorable computational scaling and high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how tasks such as interpolating to ``off-grid" angles and nulling an interferer are more computationally efficient when performed directly in beamspace.

Title: Architecture Design for Rise/Fall Asymmetry Glitch Minimization in Current-Steering DACs
Authors: Ramin Babaee, Shahab Oveis Gharan, Martin Bouchard
Abstract: Current-steering digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is a prominent architecture that is commonly used in high-speed applications such as optical communications. One of the shortcomings of this architecture is the output glitches that are input dependent and degrade the dynamic performance of the DAC. We investigate DAC glitches that arise from asymmetry in the fall/rise response of DAC switches. We formulate a glitch metric that defines the overall DAC performance, which is then used to find a novel DAC weighting scheme. Numerical simulations show that the proposed architecture can potentially provide a significant performance advantage compared to the segmented structure.

Title: Cascaded Tightly-Coupled Observer Design for Single-Range-Aided Inertial Navigation
Authors: Oussama Sifour, Soulaimane Berkane, Abdelhamid Tayebi
Abstract: This work introduces a single-range-aided navigation observer that reconstructs the full state of a rigid body using only an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a body-frame vector measurement (e.g., magnetometer), and a distance measurement from a fixed anchor point. The design first formulates an extended linear time-varying (LTV) system to estimate body-frame position, body-frame velocity, and the gravity direction. The recovered gravity direction, combined with the body-frame vector measurement, is then used to reconstruct the full orientation on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, resulting in a cascaded observer architecture. Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) of the cascaded design is established under a uniform observability condition, ensuring robustness to sensor noise and trajectory variations. Simulation studies on three-dimensional trajectories demonstrate accurate estimation of position, velocity, and orientation, highlighting single-range aiding as a lightweight and effective modality for autonomous navigation.

Title: AudioScene: Integrating Object-Event Audio into 3D Scenes
Authors: Shuaihang Yuan, Congcong Wen, Muhammad Shafique, Anthony Tzes, Yi Fang
Abstract: The rapid advances in audio analysis underscore its vast potential for humancomputer interaction, environmental monitoring, and public safety; yet, existing audioonly datasets often lack spatial context. To address this gap, we present two novel audiospatial scene datasets, AudioScanNet and AudioRoboTHOR, designed to explore audioconditioned tasks within 3D environments. By integrating audio clips with spatially aligned 3D scenes, our datasets enable research on how audio signals interact with spatial context. To associate audio events with corresponding spatial information, we leverage the common sense reasoning ability of large language models and supplement them with rigorous human verification, This approach offers greater scalability compared to purely manual annotation while maintaining high standards of accuracy, completeness, and diversity, quantified through inter annotator agreement and performance on two benchmark tasks audio based 3D visual grounding and audio based robotic zeroshot navigation. The results highlight the limitations of current audiocentric methods and underscore the practical challenges and significance of our datasets in advancing audio guided spatial learning.

Title: LocaGen: Sub-Sample Time-Delay Learning for Beam Localization
Authors: Ishaan Kunwar, Henry Cantor, Tyler Rizzo, Ayaan Qayyum
Abstract: The goal of LocaGen is to improve the localization performance of audio signals in the 2-D beam localization problem. LocaGen reduces sampling quantization errors through machine learning models trained on realistic synthetic data generated by a simulation. The system increases the accuracy of both direction-of-arrival (DOA) and precise location estimation of an audio beam from an array of three microphones. We demonstrate LocaGen's efficacy on a low-powered embedded system with an increased localization accuracy with a minimal increase in real-time resource usage. LocaGen was demonstrated to reduce DOA error by approximately 67% even with a microphone array of only 10 kHz in audio processing.

Title: Beyond Unified Models: A Service-Oriented Approach to Low Latency, Context Aware Phonemization for Real Time TTS
Authors: Mahta Fetrat, Donya Navabi, Zahra Dehghanian, Morteza Abolghasemi, Hamid R. Rabiee
Abstract: Lightweight, real-time text-to-speech systems are crucial for accessibility. However, the most efficient TTS models often rely on lightweight phonemizers that struggle with context-dependent challenges. In contrast, more advanced phonemizers with a deeper linguistic understanding typically incur high computational costs, which prevents real-time performance. This paper examines the trade-off between phonemization quality and inference speed in G2P-aided TTS systems, introducing a practical framework to bridge this gap. We propose lightweight strategies for context-aware phonemization and a service-oriented TTS architecture that executes these modules as independent services. This design decouples heavy context-aware components from the core TTS engine, effectively breaking the latency barrier and enabling real-time use of high-quality phonemization models. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves pronunciation soundness and linguistic accuracy while maintaining real-time responsiveness, making it well-suited for offline and end-device TTS applications.

Title: Expectations in Expectation Propagation
Authors: Zilu Zhao, Fangqing Xiao, Dirk Slock
Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress. In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values. Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.

Title: Joint Activity Design Heuristics for Enhancing Human-Machine Collaboration
Authors: Mohammadreza Jalaeian, Dane A. Morey, Michael F. Rayo
Abstract: Joint activity describes when more than one agent (human or machine) contributes to the completion of a task or activity. Designing for joint activity focuses on explicitly supporting the interdependencies between agents necessary for effective coordination among agents engaged in the joint activity. This builds and expands upon designing for usability to further address how technologies can be designed to act as effective team players. Effective joint activity requires supporting, at minimum, five primary macrocognitive functions within teams: Event Detection, Sensemaking, Adaptability, Perspective-Shifting, and Coordination. Supporting these functions is equally as important as making technologies usable. We synthesized fourteen heuristics from relevant literature including display design, human factors, cognitive systems engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science to aid the design, development, and evaluation of technologies that support joint human-machine activity.

Title: Adaptive Matched Filtering for Sensing With Communication Signals in Cluttered Environments
Authors: Lei Xie, Hengtao He, Yifeng Xiong, Fan Liu, Shi Jin
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of the adaptive matched filtering (AMF) in cluttered environments, particularly when operating with superimposed signals. Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: Geometric-Stochastic Multimodal Deep Learning for Predictive Modeling of SUDEP and Stroke Vulnerability
Authors: Preksha Girish, Rachana Mysore, Mahanthesha U, Shrey Kumar, Misbah Fatimah Annigeri, Tanish Jain
Abstract: Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and acute ischemic stroke are life-threatening conditions involving complex interactions across cortical, brainstem, and autonomic systems. We present a unified geometric-stochastic multimodal deep learning framework that integrates EEG, ECG, respiration, SpO2, EMG, and fMRI signals to model SUDEP and stroke vulnerability. The approach combines Riemannian manifold embeddings, Lie-group invariant feature representations, fractional stochastic dynamics, Hamiltonian energy-flow modeling, and cross-modal attention mechanisms. Stroke propagation is modeled using fractional epidemic diffusion over structural brain graphs. Experiments on the MULTI-CLARID dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and interpretable biomarkers derived from manifold curvature, fractional memory indices, attention entropy, and diffusion centrality. The proposed framework provides a mathematically principled foundation for early detection, risk stratification, and interpretable multimodal modeling in neural-autonomic disorders.

Title: Model-Based Diffusion Sampling for Predictive Control in Offline Decision Making
Authors: Haldun Balim, Na Li, Yilun Du
Abstract: Offline decision-making requires synthesizing reliable behaviors from fixed datasets without further interaction, yet existing generative approaches often yield trajectories that are dynamically infeasible. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Finally, we deploy our method on a real quadrupedal robot, showcasing its practicality for real-world control.

Title: Möbius Transformations and the Analytic--Geometric Reconstruction of the Induction--Machine Circle Diagram
Authors: Anubhav Gupta
Abstract: The Heyland circle diagram is a classical graphical method for representing the steady--state behavior of induction machines using no--load and blocked--rotor test data. Despite its long pedagogical history, the traditional geometric construction has not been formalized within a closed analytic framework. This note develops a complete Euclidean reconstruction of the diagram using only the two measured phasors and elementary geometric operations, yielding a unique circle, a torque chord, a slip scale, and a maximum--torque point. We prove that this constructed circle coincides precisely with the analytic steady--state current locus obtained from the per--phase equivalent circuit. A Möbius transformation interpretation reveals the complex--analytic origin of the diagram's circularity and offers a compact explanation of its geometric structure.

Title: On Discrete Ambiguity Functions of Random Communication Waveforms
Authors: Ying Zhang, Fan Liu, Yifeng Xiong, Weijie Yuan, Shuangyang Li, Le Zheng, Tony Xiao Han, Christos Masouros, Shi Jin
Abstract: This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.

Abstract: This article investigates on the improvement and stabilization of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) output voltages in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a vertical-axis tidal turbine using advanced control strategies. The research integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to enhance voltage stability and efficiency. Initially, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach based on Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy logic controllers is explored. To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers. The hybrid ANN-PSO technique improves the voltage regulation by dynamically adapting to system variations and providing real-time reference speed adjustments. This research highlights the AI-based hybrid optimization benefit to stabilize the output voltage of tidal energy systems, thereby increasing reliability and efficiency in renewable energy applications.

Title: Using reinforcement learning to probe the role of feedback in skill acquisition
Authors: Antonio Terpin, Raffaello D'Andrea
Abstract: Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.

Title: The SMART+ Framework for AI Systems
Authors: Laxmiraju Kandikatla, Branislav Radeljic
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are now an integral part of multiple industries. In clinical research, AI supports automated adverse event detection in clinical trials, patient eligibility screening for protocol enrollment, and data quality validation. Beyond healthcare, AI is transforming finance through real-time fraud detection, automated loan risk assessment, and algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. To address these concerns, we introduce the SMART+ Framework - a structured model built on the pillars of Safety, Monitoring, Accountability, Reliability, and Transparency, and further enhanced with Privacy & Security, Data Governance, Fairness & Bias, and Guardrails. SMART+ offers a practical, comprehensive approach to evaluating and governing AI systems across industries. This framework aligns with evolving mechanisms and regulatory guidance to integrate operational safeguards, oversight procedures, and strengthened privacy and governance controls. SMART+ demonstrates risk mitigation, trust-building, and compliance readiness. By enabling responsible AI adoption and ensuring auditability, SMART+ provides a robust foundation for effective AI governance in clinical research.

Title: Saturation-based robustly optimal hierarchical operation control of microgrids
Authors: Ujjwal Pratap, Steffen Hofmann
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of robustly optimal operation control of microgrids with a high share of renewable energy sources. The main goal is to ensure optimal operation under a wide range of circumstances, given the highly intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable sources and load demand. We formally state this problem, and, in order to solve it, we make effective use of the hierarchical power system control approach. We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy. We prove that this enables the use of constant power setpoints to achieve optimal operation under certain conditions. In order to relax these conditions, the approach is combined with an energy management system, which solves a robust unit commitment problem within a model predictive control framework. Finally, a case study demonstrates the viability of the control design.

Title: BIRA: A Spherical Bistatic Radar Reflectivity Measurement System
Authors: Carsten Andrich, Tobias F. Nowack, Alexander Ihlow, Sebastian Giehl, Maximilian Engelhardt, Gerd Sommerkorn, Andreas Schwind, Willi Hofmann, Christian Bornkessel, Matthias A. Hein, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility for independent spherical positioning of two probes with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, it employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique capability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating measurements on static objects. Additionally, the installation is capable of spherical near-field antenna measurements over these wide frequency ranges.

Title: Fast Switching in Mixed-Integer Model Predictive Control
Authors: Artemi Makarow, Christian Kirches
Abstract: We deduce stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control with a downstream oversampling phase. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness of model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We deduce nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility on an oversampling time grid. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments illustrate practical relevance of fast control switching.

Title: Optimal Transmission Switching and Busbar Splitting in Hybrid AC/DC Grids
Authors: Giacomo Bastianel, Marta Vanin, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun
Abstract: Driven by global climate goals, an increasing amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is currently being installed worldwide. Especially in the context of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most effective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid AC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and meshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited literature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the total power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed. The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.

Title: Enhancing Brain Age Estimation with a Multimodal 3D CNN Approach Combining Structural MRI and AI-Synthesized Cerebral Blood Volume Measures
Authors: Jordan Jomsky, Kay C. Igwe, Zongyu Li, Yiren Zhang, Max Lashley, Tal Nuriel, Andrew Laine, Jia Guo (for the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative and for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)
Abstract: Brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) is a promising imaging-derived biomarker of neurobiological aging and disease risk, yet current approaches rely predominantly on T1-weighted structural MRI (T1w), overlooking functional vascular changes that may precede tissue damage and cognitive decline. Artificial intelligence-generated cerebral blood volume (AICBV) maps, synthesized from non-contrast MRI, offer an alternative to contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging by capturing vascular information relevant to early neurodegeneration. We developed a multimodal BrainAGE framework that integrates brain age predictions using linear regression from two separate 3D VGG-based networks, one model trained on only structural T1w scans and one trained on only AICBV maps generated from a pre-trained 3D patch-based deep learning model. Each model was trained and validated on 2,851 scans from 13 open-source datasets and was evaluated for concordance with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using ADNI subjects (n=1,233). The combined model achieved the most accurate brain age gap for cognitively normal (CN) controls, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.95 years ($R^2$=0.943), outperforming models trained on T1w (MAE=4.10) or AICBV alone (MAE=4.49). Saliency maps revealed complementary modality contributions: T1w emphasized white matter and cortical atrophy, while AICBV highlighted vascular-rich and periventricular regions implicated in hypoperfusion and early cerebrovascular dysfunction, consistent with normal aging. Next, we observed that BrainAGE increased stepwise across diagnostic strata (CN < MCI < AD) and correlated with cognitive impairment (CDRSB r=0.403; MMSE r=-0.310). AICBV-based BrainAGE showed particularly strong separation between stable vs. progressive MCI (p=$1.47 \times 10^{-8}$), suggesting sensitivity to prodromal vascular changes that precede overt atrophy.

Title: Heart Failure Prediction using Modal Decomposition and Masked Autoencoders for Scarce Echocardiography Databases
Authors: Andrés Bell-Navas, María Villalba-Orero, Enrique Lara-Pezzi, Jesús Garicano-Mena, Soledad Le Clainche
Abstract: Heart diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, implying approximately 18 million deaths according to the WHO. In particular, heart failures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early, rapid, and effective prediction. This work presents an automatic system based on a novel framework which combines Modal Decomposition and Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to extend the application from heart disease classification to the more challenging and specific task of heart failure time prediction, not previously addressed to the best of authors' knowledge. This system comprises two stages. The first one transforms the data from a database of echocardiography video sequences into a large collection of annotated images compatible with the training phase of machine learning-based frameworks and deep learning-based ones. This stage includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage builds and trains a Vision Transformer (ViT). MAEs based on a combined scheme of self-supervised (SSL) and supervised learning, so far barely explored in the literature about heart failure prediction, are adopted to effectively train the ViT from scratch, even with scarce databases. The designed neural network analyses in real-time images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the time of happening a heart failure. This approach demonstrates to improve prediction accuracy from scarce databases and to be superior to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The source code will be incorporated into the next version release of the ModelFLOWs-app software (this https URL).

Title: Verifiable Mission Planning For Space Operations
Authors: Quentin Rommel, Michael Hibbard, Pavan Shukla, Himanshu Save, Srinivas Bettadpur, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Spacecraft must operate under environmental and actuator uncertainties while meeting strict safety requirements. Traditional approaches rely on scenario-based heuristics that fail to account for stochastic influences, leading to suboptimal or unsafe plans. We propose a finite-horizon, chance-constrained Markov decision process for mission planning, where states represent mission and vehicle parameters, actions correspond to operational adjustments, and temporal logic specifications encode operational reach-avoid constraints. We synthesize policies that optimize mission objectives while ensuring constraints are met with high probability. Applied to the GRACE-FO mission, the approach accounts for stochastic solar activity and uncertain thrust performance, yielding maneuver schedules that maximize scientific return and provably satisfy safety requirements. We demonstrate how Markov decision processes can be applied to space missions, enabling autonomous operation with formal guarantees.

Title: From Fibers to Cells: Fourier-Based Registration Enables Virtual Cresyl Violet Staining From 3D Polarized Light Imaging
Authors: Alexander Oberstrass, Esteban Vaca, Eric Upschulte, Meiqi Niu, Nicola Palomero-Gallagher, David Graessel, Christian Schiffer, Markus Axer, Katrin Amunts, Timo Dickscheid
Abstract: Comprehensive assessment of the various aspects of the brain's microstructure requires the use of complementary imaging techniques. This includes measuring the spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers (myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light microscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D orientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been introduced, a method that is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after 3D-PLI measurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and cytoarchitecture can potentially be established in the same section. However, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a costly nonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed relationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the complexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows for a limited number of such samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep learning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining of 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. We use a supervised setting, building on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet staining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high correspondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training data using Fourier-based registration. In this way, registration can be efficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and predicted staining. We demonstrate that the proposed method can predict a Cresyl violet staining from 3D-PLI, resulting in a virtual staining that exhibits plausible patterns of cell organization in gray matter, with larger cell bodies being localized at their expected positions.

Title: Quantum-Accelerated Wireless Communications: Concepts, Connections, and Implications
Authors: Naoki Ishikawa, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Petar Popovski, Robert W. Heath Jr
Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and clarifying a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies indicating speedup opportunities, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that quantum algorithms, including their gate-level realizations, can benefit from the design intuition applied in communication engineering. This article aims to catalyze interdisciplinary research at the frontier of quantum information processing and future communication systems.

Title: PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Diffusion Image Prior
Authors: Fumio Hashimoto, Kuang Gong
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets. For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested on [$^{18}$F]FDG data and amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one [$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types, providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET imaging.

Title: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) for 6G: Properties, Features, and Challenges
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Vincent Savaux, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Christos Masouros
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.

Title: Guiding WaveMamba with Frequency Maps for Image Debanding
Authors: Xinyi Wang, Smaranda Tasmoc, Nantheera Anantrasirichai, Angeliki Katsenou
Abstract: Compression at low bitrates in modern codecs often introduces banding artifacts, especially in smooth regions such as skies. These artifacts degrade visual quality and are common in user-generated content due to repeated transcoding. We propose a banding restoration method that employs the Wavelet State Space Model and a frequency masking map to preserve high-frequency details. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark of open-source banding restoration methods and evaluate their performance on two public banding image datasets. Experimentation on the available datasets suggests that the proposed post-processing approach effectively suppresses banding compared to the state-of-the-art method (a DBI value of 0.082 on BAND-2k) while preserving image textures. Visual inspections of the results confirm this. Code and supplementary material are available at: this https URL.

Title: Random forest-based out-of-distribution detection for robust lung cancer segmentation
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

Title: On the Relation of Characteristic Modes of Different Conducting Structures
Authors: Leonardo Mörlein, Dirk Manteuffel
Abstract: A formalism is derived to analyze the scattering of a conducting structure based on the characteristic modes of another structure whose surface is a superset of the first structure. This enables the analysis and comparison of different structures using a common basis of characteristic modes. Additionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation matrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal transformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the characteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures. This matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different bases. Finally, three examples are provided along with a discussion of some aspects of the theory. The first two examples aim to validate and illustrate the formalism. The third example shows how the formalism can be applied in the design process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from a base structure.

Title: 6D Movable Metasurface (6DMM) in Downlink NOMA Transmissions
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.

Title: Online Energy Storage Arbitrage under Imperfect Predictions: A Conformal Risk-Aware Approach
Authors: Yiqian Wu, Ming Yi, Bolun Xu, James Anderson
Abstract: This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risk arising from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.

Title: Design Principles of Zero-Shot Self-Supervised Unknown Emitter Detectors
Authors: Mikhail Krasnov, Ljupcho Milosheski, Mihael Mohorčič, Carolina Fortuna
Abstract: The proliferation of wireless devices necessitates more robust and reliable emitter detection and identification for critical tasks such as spectrum management and network security. Existing studies exploring methods for unknown emitters identification, however, are typically hindered by their dependence on labeled or proprietary datasets, unrealistic assumptions (e.g. all samples with identical transmitted messages), or deficiency of systematic evaluations across different architectures and design dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learning modules. We demonstrate that prior self-supervised, zero-shot emitter detection approaches commonly use datasets with identical transmitted messages. To address this limitation, we propose a 2D-Constellation data modality for scenarios with varying messages, achieving up to a 40\% performance improvement in ROC-AUC, NMI, and F1 metrics compared to conventional raw I/Q data. Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization. We evaluate all data modalities and learning modules across three learning approaches: Deep Clustering, Auto Encoder and Contrastive Learning.

Title: Direction-of-Arrival and Noise Covariance Matrix joint estimation for beamforming
Authors: Vitor Gelsleichter Probst Curtarelli, Stephan Paul, Anderson Wedderhoff Spengler
Abstract: We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.

Title: Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space
Authors: Ervan Kassarian, Francesco Sanfedino, Daniel Alazard, Andrea Marrazza
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate - based on the theory of upper-C1 functions - the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. In particular, we prove that the sequential quadratic programming algorithm converges to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points, and that such conditions are satisfied by any subgradient at a local minimum. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. From a practical point of view, we combine the local exploitation proposed above with a global exploration using either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization. We show that the proposed constrained optimization effectively complements Monte-Carlo sampling by enabling fast detection of rare worst-case configurations, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations.

Title: Development of a Transit-Time Ultrasonic Flow Measurement System for Partially Filled Pipes: Incorporating Flow Profile Correction Factor and Real-Time Clogging Detection
Authors: Mohammadhadi Mesmarian, Mohammad Mahdi Kharidar, Hossein Nejat Pishkenari
Abstract: Flow measurement in partially filled pipes presents greater complexity compared to fully filled systems, primarily due to the complex velocity distribution within the cross-section, which is a key source of measurement inaccuracy. To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action.

Abstract: The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water community. This competition will be hosted at the 4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026. This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: "Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems." The objective is to design and operate a water distribution system over a long-term horizon under deep uncertainty, with interventions applied in stages. For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence.

Title: Symmetry-Based Formation Control on Cycle Graphs Using Dihedral Point Groups
Authors: Zamir Martinez, Daniel Zelazo
Abstract: This work develops a symmetry-based framework for formation control on cycle graphs using Dihedral point-group constraints. We show that enforcing inter-agent reflection symmetries, together with anchoring a single designated agent to its prescribed mirror axis, is sufficient to realize every $\mathcal{C}_{nv}$-symmetric configuration using only $n-1$ communication links. The resulting control laws have a matrix-weighted Laplacian structure and guarantee exponential convergence to the desired symmetric configuration. Furthermore, we extend the method to enable coordinated maneuvers along a time-varying reference trajectory. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical analysis.

Title: Obstacle Avoidance of UAV in Dynamic Environments Using Direction and Velocity-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field
Authors: Nikita Vaibhav Pavle, Shrreya Rajneesh, Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Manoranjan Sinha
Abstract: The conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) is fundamentally limited by the local minima issue and its inability to account for the kinematics of moving obstacles. This paper addresses the critical challenge of autonomous collision avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic and cluttered airspace by proposing a novel Direction and Relative Velocity Weighted Artificial Potential Field (APF). In this approach, a bounded weighting function, $\omega(\theta,v_{e})$, is introduced to dynamically scale the repulsive potential based on the direction and velocity of the obstacle relative to the UAV. This robust APF formulation is integrated within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate collision-free trajectories while adhering to kinematic constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves local minima and significantly enhances safety by enabling smooth, predictive avoidance maneuvers. The system ensures superior path integrity and reliable performance, confirming its viability for autonomous navigation in complex environments.

Title: Geometry Aware Meta-Learning Neural Network for Joint Phase and Precoder Optimization in RIS
Authors: Dahlia Devapriya, Aparna V C, Sheetal Kalyani
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided systems, the joint optimization of the precoder matrix at the base station and the phase shifts of the RIS elements involves significant complexity. In this paper, we propose a complex-valued, geometry aware meta-learning neural network that maximizes the weighted sum rate in a multi-user multiple input single output system. By leveraging the complex circle geometry for phase shifts and spherical geometry for the precoder, the optimization occurs on Riemannian manifolds, leading to faster convergence. We use a complex-valued neural network for phase shifts and an Euler inspired update for the precoder network. Our approach outperforms existing neural network-based algorithms, offering higher weighted sum rates, lower power consumption, and significantly faster convergence. Specifically, it converges faster by nearly 100 epochs, with a 0.7 bps improvement in weighted sum rate and a 1.8 dB power gain when compared with existing work. Further it outperforms the state-of-the-art alternating optimization algorithm by 0.86 bps with a 2.6 dB power gain.

Abstract: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are popular research areas in Computer Vision and related fields. We highlight transformative applications in image enhancement, filtering techniques, and pattern recognition. By integrating frameworks like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Z-Transform, and Fourier Transform methods, we enable robust data manipulation and feature extraction essential for AI-driven tasks. Using Python, we implement algorithms that optimize real-time data processing, forming a foundation for scalable, high-performance solutions in computer vision. This work illustrates the potential of ML and DL to advance DSP and DIP methodologies, contributing to artificial intelligence, automated feature extraction, and applications across diverse domains.

Title: CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction
Authors: Yuansheng Lian, Ke Zhang, Meng Li
Abstract: Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.

Title: Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion
Authors: Minjie Deng, Yan Wei, An Wu, Yuncan Ouyang, Hao Zhai, Qianyao Peng
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors forces most deep learning approaches to rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features or to generate pseudo-supervised images through algorithmic constructions. Unlike previous methods, this work re-examines prior-guided learning under few-shot conditions by introducing rough set theory. We regard the traditional algorithm as a prior generator, while the network re-inferrs and adaptively optimizes the prior through a dynamic loss function, reducing the inference burden of the network and enabling effective few-shot this http URL provide the prior, we propose the Granular Ball Pixel Computation (GBPC) algorithm. GBPC models pixel pairs in a luminance subspace using meta-granular balls and mines intra-ball information at multiple granular levels. At the fine-grained level, sliding granular balls assign adaptive weights to individual pixels to produce pixel-level prior fusion. At the coarse-grained level, the algorithm performs split computation within a single image to estimate positive and boundary domain distributions, enabling modality awareness and prior confidence estimation, which dynamically guide the loss this http URL network and the algorithmic prior are coupled through the loss function to form an integrated framework. Thanks to the dynamic weighting mechanism, the network can adaptively adjust to different priors during training, enhancing its perception and fusion capability across modalities. We name this framework GBFF (Granular Ball Fusion Framework). Experiments on four fusion tasks demonstrate that even with only ten training image pairs per task, GBFF achieves superior performance in both visual quality and model compactness.

Title: Haptic-based Complementary Filter for Rigid Body Rotations
Authors: Amit Kumar, Domenico Campolo, Ravi N. Banavar
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of 3D rotations poses well-known challenges in generalizing planar problems to three-dimensional ones, even more so in contact-rich tasks where haptic information (i.e., forces/torques) is involved. In this sense, not all learning-based algorithms that are currently available generalize to 3D orientation estimation. Non-linear filters defined on $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$ are widely used with inertial measurement sensors; however, none of them have been used with haptic measurements. This paper presents a unique complementary filtering framework that interprets the geometric shape of objects in the form of superquadrics, exploits the symmetry of $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$, and uses force and vision sensors as measurements to provide an estimate of orientation. The framework's robustness and almost global stability are substantiated by a set of experiments on a dual-arm robotic setup.

Title: VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning
Authors: Qianyue Hu, Junyan Wu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at this https URL.

Title: The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation
Authors: Sajjad Shahabodini, Mobina Mansoori, Farnoush Bayatmakou, Jamshid Abouei, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Arash Mohammadi
Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

Title: Beyond Formal Semantics for Capabilities and Skills: Model Context Protocol in Manufacturing
Authors: Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Aljosha Köcher, Felix Gehlhoff
Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies, Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system, where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven production systems.

Title: Random-phase Wave Splatting of Translucent Primitives for Computer-generated Holography
Authors: Brian Chao, Jacqueline Yang, Suyeon Choi, Manu Gopakumar, Ryota Koiso, Gordon Wetzstein
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for VR/AR systems but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Conventional CGH typically generates smooth-phase holograms, limiting view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur, while severely under-utilizing the SLM space-bandwidth product. We propose Random-phase Wave Splatting (RPWS), a unified wave optics rendering framework that converts arbitrary 3D representations based on 2D translucent primitives into random-phase holograms. RPWS is fully compatible with modern 3D representations such as Gaussians and triangles, improves bandwidth utilization which effectively enlarges eyebox size, reconstructs accurate defocus blur and parallax, and leverages time-multiplexed rendering not as a heuristic for speckle suppression, but as a mathematically exact alpha-blending mechanism derived from first principles in statistics. At the core of RPWS are (1) a new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme for random-phase geometric primitives, ensuring correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion when compositing millions of primitives. RPWS departs substantially from the recent primitive-based CGH algorithm, Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS). Because GWS uses smooth-phase primitives, it struggles to capture view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur and under-utilizes the SLM space-bandwidth product; moreover, naively extending GWS to random-phase primitives fails to reconstruct accurate colors. In contrast, RPWS is designed from the ground up for arbitrary random-phase translucent primitives, and through simulations and experimental validations we demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.

Title: Enhancing the NAO: Extending Capabilities of Legacy Robots for Long-Term Research
Authors: Austin Wilson, Sahar Kapasi, Zane Greene, Alexis E. Block
Abstract: Legacy (unsupported) robotic platforms often lose research utility when manufacturer support ends, preventing integration of modern sensing, speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.

Title: TenonOS: A Self-Generating LibOS-on-LibOS Framework for Time-Critical Embedded Operating Systems
Authors: Xinkui Zhao, Yifan Zhang, Haidan Zhao, Hao Zhang, Qingyu Ma, Lufei Zhang, Guanjie Cheng, Shuiguang Deng, Jianwei Yin, Zuoning Chen
Abstract: The growing complexity of embedded systems creates tension between rich functionality and strict resource and real-time constraints. Traditional monolithic operating system and hypervisor designs suffer from resource bloat and unpredictable scheduling, making them unsuitable for time-critical workloads where low latency and low jitter are essential. We propose TenonOS, a demand-driven, self-generating, lightweight operating system framework for time-critical embedded systems that rethinks both hypervisor and operating system architectures. TenonOS introduces a LibOS-on-LibOS model that decomposes hypervisor and operating system functionality into fine-grained, reusable micro-libraries. A generative orchestration engine dynamically composes these libraries to synthesize a customized runtime tailored to each application's criticality, timing requirements, and resource profile. TenonOS consists of two core components: Mortise, a minimalist micro-hypervisor, and Tenon, a real-time library operating system. Mortise provides lightweight isolation and removes the usual double-scheduler overhead in virtualized setups, while Tenon provides precise and deterministic task management. By generating only the necessary software stack per workload, TenonOS removes redundant layers, minimizes the trusted computing base, and maximizes responsiveness. Experiments show a 40.28 percent reduction in scheduling latency, an ultra-compact 361 KiB memory footprint, and strong adaptability.

Title: Unifying Entropy Regularization in Optimal Control: From and Back to Classical Objectives via Iterated Soft Policies and Path Integral Solutions
Authors: Ajinkya Bhole, Mohammad Mahmoudi Filabadi, Guillaume Crevecoeur, Tom Lefebvre
Abstract: This paper develops a unified perspective on several stochastic optimal control formulations through the lens of Kullback-Leibler regularization. We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems.
