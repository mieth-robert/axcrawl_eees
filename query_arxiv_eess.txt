Abstract: The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) cluster of challenges has significantly advanced brain tumor image analysis by providing large, curated datasets and addressing clinically relevant tasks. However, despite its success and popularity, algorithms and models developed through BraTS have seen limited adoption in both scientific and clinical communities. To accelerate their dissemination, we introduce BraTS orchestrator, an open-source Python package that provides seamless access to state-of-the-art segmentation and synthesis algorithms for diverse brain tumors from the BraTS challenge ecosystem. Available on GitHub (this https URL), the package features intuitive tutorials designed for users with minimal programming experience, enabling both researchers and clinicians to easily deploy winning BraTS algorithms for inference. By abstracting the complexities of modern deep learning, BraTS orchestrator democratizes access to the specialized knowledge developed within the BraTS community, making these advances readily available to broader neuro-radiology and neuro-oncology audiences.

Title: Reliable Noninvasive Glucose Sensing via CNN-Based Spectroscopy
Authors: El Arbi Belfarsi, Henry Flores, Maria Valero
Abstract: In this study, we present a dual-modal AI framework based on short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. The first modality employs a multi-wavelength SWIR imaging system coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatial features linked to glucose absorption. The second modality uses a compact photodiode voltage sensor and machine learning regressors (e.g., random forest) on normalized optical signals. Both approaches were evaluated on synthetic blood phantoms and skin-mimicking materials across physiological glucose levels (70 to 200 mg/dL). The CNN achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.82% at 650 nm with 100% Zone A coverage in the Clarke Error Grid, while the photodiode system reached 86.4% Zone A accuracy. This framework constitutes a state-of-the-art solution that balances clinical accuracy, cost efficiency, and wearable integration, paving the way for reliable continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring.

Title: Observer Switching Strategy for Enhanced State Estimation in CSTR Networks
Authors: Lisbel Bárzaga-Martell, Francisco Ibáñez, Angel L. Cedeño, Maria Coronel, Francisco Concha, Norelys Aguila-Camacho, José Ricardo Pérez-Correa
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is essential for monitoring and controlling nonlinear chemical reactors, such as continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), where limited sensor coverage and process uncertainties hinder real-time observability. This paper introduces a novel multi-observer switching framework that combines several advanced estimators: Extended Luenberger Observer (ELO), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Quadrature Kalman Filter (QKF), and Particle Filter (PF), operating in parallel. At each sampling instant, a cost function based on the $L_1$ norm and Kullback-Leibler divergence selects the observer, yielding the best agreement with available measurements. The proposed architecture is validated through simulations of both linearized and fully nonlinear CSTR models with up to three reactors in series. Results show that the switching strategy significantly reduces estimation errors compared to single-observer approaches, especially under partial observability and parametric uncertainty. Despite its modular design, the framework remains computationally tractable, making it suitable for real-time industrial applications such as fault detection and model-based predictive control.

Title: Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems: Characterization and Verifiable Neural Network Estimation
Authors: Mohamed Serry, Haoyu Li, Ruikun Zhou, Huan Zhang, Jun Liu
Abstract: Analysis of nonlinear autonomous systems typically involves estimating domains of attraction, which have been a topic of extensive research interest for decades. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where existing methods are conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. The estimation becomes even more challenging when accounting for state constraints. In this work, we propose a framework to accurately estimate safe (state-constrained) domains of attraction for discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. In establishing this framework, we first derive a new Zubov equation, whose solution corresponds to the exact safe domain of attraction. The solution to the aforementioned Zubov equation is shown to be unique and continuous over the whole state space. We then present a physics-informed approach to approximating the solution of the Zubov equation using neural networks. To obtain certifiable estimates of the domain of attraction from the neural network approximate solutions, we propose a verification framework that can be implemented using standard verification tools (e.g., $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN and dReal). To illustrate its effectiveness, we demonstrate our approach through numerical examples concerning nonlinear systems with state constraints.

Title: Comparison of ConvNeXt and Vision-Language Models for Breast Density Assessment in Screening Mammography
Authors: Yusdivia Molina-Román, David Gómez-Ortiz, Ernestina Menasalvas-Ruiz, José Gerardo Tamez-Peña, Alejandro Santos-Díaz
Abstract: Mammographic breast density classification is essential for cancer risk assessment but remains challenging due to subjective interpretation and inter-observer variability. This study compares multimodal and CNN-based methods for automated classification using the BI-RADS system, evaluating BioMedCLIP and ConvNeXt across three learning scenarios: zero-shot classification, linear probing with textual descriptions, and fine-tuning with numerical labels. Results show that zero-shot classification achieved modest performance, while the fine-tuned ConvNeXt model outperformed the BioMedCLIP linear probe. Although linear probing demonstrated potential with pretrained embeddings, it was less effective than full fine-tuning. These findings suggest that despite the promise of multimodal learning, CNN-based models with end-to-end fine-tuning provide stronger performance for specialized medical imaging. The study underscores the need for more detailed textual representations and domain-specific adaptations in future radiology applications.

Title: Multimodal Fusion with Semi-Supervised Learning Minimizes Annotation Quantity for Modeling Videoconference Conversation Experience
Authors: Andrew Chang, Chenkai Hu, Ji Qi, Zhuojian Wei, Kexin Zhang, Viswadruth Akkaraju, David Poeppel, Dustin Freeman
Abstract: Group conversations over videoconferencing are a complex social behavior. However, the subjective moments of negative experience, where the conversation loses fluidity or enjoyment remain understudied. These moments are infrequent in naturalistic data, and thus training a supervised learning (SL) model requires costly manual data annotation. We applied semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage targeted labeled and unlabeled clips for training multimodal (audio, facial, text) deep features to predict non-fluid or unenjoyable moments in holdout videoconference sessions. The modality-fused co-training SSL achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.9 and an F1 score of 0.6, outperforming SL models by up to 4% with the same amount of labeled data. Remarkably, the best SSL model with just 8% labeled data matched 96% of the SL model's full-data performance. This shows an annotation-efficient framework for modeling videoconference experience.

Title: DREAM: On hallucinations in AI-generated content for nuclear medicine imaging
Authors: Menghua Xia, Reimund Bayerlein, Yanis Chemli, Xiaofeng Liu, Jinsong Ouyang, Georges El Fakhri, Ramsey D. Badawi, Quanzheng Li, Chi Liu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has shown remarkable performance in nuclear medicine imaging (NMI), offering cost-effective software solutions for tasks such as image enhancement, motion correction, and attenuation correction. However, these advancements come with the risk of hallucinations, generating realistic yet factually incorrect content. Hallucinations can misrepresent anatomical and functional information, compromising diagnostic accuracy and clinical trust. This paper presents a comprehensive perspective of hallucination-related challenges in AIGC for NMI, introducing the DREAM report, which covers recommendations for definition, representative examples, detection and evaluation metrics, underlying causes, and mitigation strategies. This position statement paper aims to initiate a common understanding for discussions and future research toward enhancing AIGC applications in NMI, thereby supporting their safe and effective deployment in clinical practice.

Title: Implicit Constraint-Aware Off-Policy Correction for Offline Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ali Baheri
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning promises policy improvement from logged interaction data alone, yet state-of-the-art algorithms remain vulnerable to value over-estimation and to violations of domain knowledge such as monotonicity or smoothness. We introduce implicit constraint-aware off-policy correction, a framework that embeds structural priors directly inside every Bellman update. The key idea is to compose the optimal Bellman operator with a proximal projection on a convex constraint set, which produces a new operator that (i) remains a $\gamma$-contraction, (ii) possesses a unique fixed point, and (iii) enforces the prescribed structure exactly. A differentiable optimization layer solves the projection; implicit differentiation supplies gradients for deep function approximators at a cost comparable to implicit Q-learning. On a synthetic Bid-Click auction -- where the true value is provably monotone in the bid -- our method eliminates all monotonicity violations and outperforms conservative Q-learning and implicit Q-learning in return, regret, and sample efficiency.

Title: A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Modeling Queue Length Dynamics Inspired by Self-Similarity
Authors: Shakib Mustavee, Shaurya Agarwal, Arvind Singh
Abstract: This article develops a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for modeling the temporal evolution of queue length dynamics at signalized intersections. Inspired by the observed quasiperiodic and self-similar characteristics of the queue length dynamics, the proposed model incorporates three properties into the SDE: (i) mean reversion with periodic mean, (ii) multiplicative noise, and (iii) fractional Brownian motion. It replicates key statistical features observed in real data, including the probability distribution function (PDF) and PSD of queue lengths. To our knowledge, this is the first equation-based model for queue dynamics. The proposed approach offers a transparent, data-consistent framework that may help inform and enhance the design of black-box learning algorithms with underlying traffic physics.

Title: Dynamically Tunable Helical Antenna
Authors: Ethan Chien, Jan Steckel
Abstract: Unmanned aerial FPV systems demand ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication links. At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms.

Title: Extracting transient Koopman modes from short-term weather simulations with sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition
Authors: Zhicheng Zhang, Yoshihiko Susuki, Atsushi Okazaki
Abstract: Convective features-here represented as warm bubble-like patterns-reveal essential, high-level information about how short-term weather dynamics evolve within a high-dimensional state space. We introduce a data-driven framework that uncovers transient dynamics captured by Koopman modes responsible for these structures and traces their emergence, growth, and decay. Our approach incorporates the sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition into the framework of Koopman mode decomposition, yielding a few number of selected modes whose sparse amplitudes highlight dominant transient structures. By tuning the sparsity weight, we balance reconstruction accuracy and model complexity. We illustrate the methodology on weather simulations, using the magnitude of velocity and vorticity fields as distinct observable datasets. The resulting sparse dominant Koopman modes capture the transient evolution of bubble-like pattern and can reduce the dimensionality of the weather system model, offering an efficient surrogate for diagnostic and forecasting tasks.

Title: Considering the multi-time scale rolling optimization scheduling method of micro-energy network connected to electric vehicles
Authors: Hengyu Liu, Yanhong Luo, Congcong Wu, Yin Guan, Ahmed Lotfy Elrefai, Andreas Elombo, Si Li, Sahban Wael Saeed Alnaser, Mingyu Yan
Abstract: The large-scale access of electric vehicles to the power grid not only provides flexible adjustment resources for the power system, but the temporal uncertainty and distribution complexity of their energy interaction pose significant challenges to the economy and robustness of the micro-energy network. In this paper, we propose a multi-time scale rolling optimization scheduling method for micro-energy networks considering the access of electric vehicles. In order to solve the problem of evaluating the dispatchable potential of electric vehicle clusters, a charging station aggregation model was constructed based on Minkowski summation theory, and the scattered electric vehicle resources were aggregated into virtual energy storage units to participate in system scheduling. Integrate price-based and incentive-based demand response mechanisms to synergistically tap the potential of source-load two-side regulation; On this basis, a two-stage optimal scheduling model of day-ahead and intra-day is constructed. The simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the scale of "preventive curtailment" due to more accurate scheduling, avoids the threat of power shortage to the safety of the power grid, and has more advantages in the efficiency of new energy consumption. At the same time, intra-day scheduling significantly reduces economic penalties and operating costs by avoiding output shortages, and improves the economy of the system in an uncertain forecasting environment.

Title: Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Dynamic Environments via PELT-Driven Drift Detection and Model Adaptation
Authors: Nikhil Pawar, Guilherme Vieira Hollweg, Akhtar Hussain, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui
Abstract: Accurate time series forecasting models are often compromised by data drift, where underlying data distributions change over time, leading to significant declines in prediction performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes an adaptive forecasting framework that integrates drift detection with targeted model retraining to compensate for drift effects. The framework utilizes the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm to identify drift points within the feature space of time series data. Once drift intervals are detected, selective retraining is applied to prediction models using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Lasso Regressor architectures, allowing the models to adjust to changing data patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two datasets: a real-world dataset containing electricity consumption and HVAC system data, and a synthetic financial dataset designed to test cross-domain applicability. Initial baseline models were developed without drift detection using extensive feature engineering. After integrating drift-aware retraining, the MLP model achieved a 44% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 39% increase in R^2 on the real-world dataset, while even greater improvements were observed on the synthetic financial dataset. Similar enhancements were achieved with the Lasso Regressor. These results highlight the robustness and generalizability of incorporating drift detection and adaptive retraining to sustain forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.

Title: Breaking the Multi-Enhancement Bottleneck: Domain-Consistent Quality Enhancement for Compressed Images
Authors: Qunliang Xing, Mai Xu, Jing Yang, Shengxi Li
Abstract: Quality enhancement methods have been widely integrated into visual communication pipelines to mitigate artifacts in compressed images. Ideally, these quality enhancement methods should perform robustly when applied to images that have already undergone prior enhancement during transmission. We refer to this scenario as multi-enhancement, which generalizes the well-known multi-generation scenario of image compression. Unfortunately, current quality enhancement methods suffer from severe degradation when applied in multi-enhancement. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptation method that transforms existing quality enhancement models into domain-consistent ones. Specifically, our method enhances a low-quality compressed image into a high-quality image within the natural domain during the first enhancement, and ensures that subsequent enhancements preserve this quality without further degradation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and show that various existing models can be successfully adapted to maintain both fidelity and perceptual quality in multi-enhancement scenarios.

Title: A Comprehensive Survey on Underwater Acoustic Target Positioning and Tracking: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives
Authors: Zhong Yang, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Yonglin Tian, Changjun Fan, Runkang Guo, Wenhao Lu, Jingwei Ge, Bin Chen, Yin Zhang, Guohua Wu, Rui Wang, Gyorgy Eigner, Guangquan Cheng, Jincai Huang, Zhong Liu, Jun Zhang, Imre J. Rudas, Fei-Yue Wang
Abstract: Underwater target tracking technology plays a pivotal role in marine resource exploration, environmental monitoring, and national defense security. Given that acoustic waves represent an effective medium for long-distance transmission in aquatic environments, underwater acoustic target tracking has become a prominent research area of underwater communications and networking. Existing literature reviews often offer a narrow perspective or inadequately address the paradigm shifts driven by emerging technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning. To address these gaps, this work presents a systematic survey of this field and introduces an innovative multidimensional taxonomy framework based on target scale, sensor perception modes, and sensor collaboration patterns. Within this framework, we comprehensively survey the literature (more than 180 publications) over the period 2016-2025, spanning from the theoretical foundations to diverse algorithmic approaches in underwater acoustic target tracking. Particularly, we emphasize the transformative potential and recent advancements of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, in enhancing the performance and adaptability of underwater tracking systems. Finally, this survey concludes by identifying key challenges in the field and proposing future avenues based on emerging technologies such as federated learning, blockchain, embodied intelligence, and large models.

Authors: Thien Nhan Vo
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a sliding mode controller using the backstepping approach. The controller is employed to synthesize tracking errors and Lyapunov functions. A novel state-space representation is formulated by incorporating the dynamics of the quadrotor and accounting for non-holonomic constraints. The proposed sliding mode controller effectively addresses system nonlinearities and improves tracking of predefined trajectories. Simulation results are presented graphically to demonstrate the controller's performance.

Title: Improving Practical Aspects of End-to-End Multi-Talker Speech Recognition for Online and Offline Scenarios
Authors: Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian, Amit Das, Naoyuki Kanda, Jinyu Li, Xiaofei Wang, Yifan Gong
Abstract: We extend the frameworks of Serialized Output Training (SOT) to address practical needs of both streaming and offline automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. Our approach focuses on balancing latency and accuracy, catering to real-time captioning and summarization requirements. We propose several key improvements: (1) Leveraging Continuous Speech Separation (CSS) single-channel front-end with end-to-end (E2E) systems for highly overlapping scenarios, challenging the conventional wisdom of E2E versus cascaded setups. The CSS framework improves the accuracy of the ASR system by separating overlapped speech from multiple speakers. (2) Implementing dual models -- Conformer Transducer for streaming and Sequence-to-Sequence for offline -- or alternatively, a two-pass model based on cascaded encoders. (3) Exploring segment-based SOT (segSOT) which is better suited for offline scenarios while also enhancing readability of multi-talker transcriptions.

Title: Latent Anomaly Detection: Masked VQ-GAN for Unsupervised Segmentation in Medical CBCT
Authors: Pengwei Wang
Abstract: Advances in treatment technology now allow for the use of customizable 3D-printed hydrogel wound dressings for patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw (ONJ). Meanwhile, deep learning has enabled precise segmentation of 3D medical images using tools like nnUNet. However, the scarcity of labeled data in ONJ imaging makes supervised training impractical. This study aims to develop an unsupervised training approach for automatically identifying anomalies in imaging scans. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, a VQ-GAN is trained to accurately reconstruct normal subjects. In the second stage, random cube masking and ONJ-specific masking are applied to train a new encoder capable of recovering the data. The proposed method achieves successful segmentation on both simulated and real patient data. This approach provides a fast initial segmentation solution, reducing the burden of manual labeling. Additionally, it has the potential to be directly used for 3D printing when combined with hand-tuned post-processing.

Title: Techno-economic optimization of hybrid steam-electric energy systems with excess heat utilization and reserve market participation
Authors: Olav Galteland, Jacob Hadler-Jacobsen, Hanne Kauko
Abstract: This study investigates the economic viability and optimal configuration of a hybrid industrial energy system combining an electrode boiler, steam accumulator, and battery energy storage system (BESS). This study optimizes system operation for a specific configuration to minimize net energy costs, defined as energy costs minus profits from price arbitrage and reserve markets. The optimization uses load shifting, peak shaving, and frequency containment reserve market participation with hourly 2024 data from Norway and Germany. Net present value (NPV) analysis was performed to determine the most cost-efficient energy storage configurations. The results show that current investment costs favor steam accumulators over BESS in both countries. However, a reduction in BESS cost will make batteries economically competitive, particularly in Germany, where high price volatility and power-based grid tariffs provide stronger incentives for load shifting and peak shaving. Participation in the FCR market accounted for a 17% and 7% reduction of the net energy costs in Norway and Germany, respectively. Utilization of excess heat, through inlet water preheating, further reduced the net energy costs. Sensitivity analyses confirm that investment costs, especially for BESS, strongly influence optimal system design. These findings offer guidance for industrial flexibility investments across diverse electricity markets.

Title: Distributed Activity Detection for Cell-Free Hybrid Near-Far Field Communications
Authors: Jingreng Lei, Yang Li, Zeyi Ren, Qingfeng Lin, Ziyue Wang, Ya-Feng Liu, Yik-Chung Wu
Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection for massive machine-type communications in cell-free massive MIMO. However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.

Title: orGAN: A Synthetic Data Augmentation Pipeline for Simultaneous Generation of Surgical Images and Ground Truth Labels
Authors: Niran Nataraj, Maina Sogabe, Kenji Kawashima
Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging faces obstacles: limited data diversity, ethical issues, high acquisition costs, and the need for precise annotations. Bleeding detection and localization during surgery is especially challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that reflect real surgical scenarios. We propose orGAN, a GAN-based system for generating high-fidelity, annotated surgical images of bleeding. By leveraging small "mimicking organ" datasets, synthetic models that replicate tissue properties and bleeding, our approach reduces ethical concerns and data-collection costs. orGAN builds on StyleGAN with Relational Positional Learning to simulate bleeding events realistically and mark bleeding coordinates. A LaMa-based inpainting module then restores clean, pre-bleed visuals, enabling precise pixel-level annotations. In evaluations, a balanced dataset of orGAN and mimicking-organ images achieved 90% detection accuracy in surgical settings and up to 99% frame-level accuracy. While our development data lack diverse organ morphologies and contain intraoperative artifacts, orGAN markedly advances ethical, efficient, and cost-effective creation of realistic annotated bleeding datasets, supporting broader integration of AI in surgical practice.

Authors: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Wenwen Chen, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization problem for TDoA-based UAV localization in low-altitude urban environments with hexagonal grid node deployment. We derive a lightweight optimized node selection strategy based on only RSSI measurements, to pre-select optimal nodes, avoiding extensive TDoA measurements in energy-constrained UAV scenarios. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that dynamically selecting the number of reference nodes improves localization performance while minimizing resource overhead.

Title: BRISC: Annotated Dataset for Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification with Swin-HAFNet
Authors: Amirreza Fateh, Yasin Rezvani, Sara Moayedi, Sadjad Rezvani, Fatemeh Fateh, Mansoor Fateh
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remain key challenges in medical image analysis, largely due to the lack of high-quality, balanced, and diverse datasets. In this work, we present a new curated MRI dataset designed specifically for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans annotated by certified radiologists and physicians, spanning three major tumor types-glioma, meningioma, and pituitary-as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we propose a transformer-based segmentation model and benchmark it against established baselines. Our method achieves the highest weighted mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 82.3%, with improvements observed across all tumor categories. Importantly, this study serves primarily as an introduction to the dataset, establishing foundational benchmarks for future research. We envision this dataset as a valuable resource for advancing machine learning applications in neuro-oncology, supporting both academic research and clinical decision-support development. datasetlink: this https URL

Title: Compressed Video Super-Resolution based on Hierarchical Encoding
Authors: Yuxuan Jiang, Siyue Teng, Qiang Zhu, Chen Feng, Chengxi Zeng, Fan Zhang, Shuyuan Zhu, Bing Zeng, David Bull
Abstract: This paper presents a general-purpose video super-resolution (VSR) method, dubbed VSR-HE, specifically designed to enhance the perceptual quality of compressed content. Targeting scenarios characterized by heavy compression, the method upscales low-resolution videos by a ratio of four, from 180p to 720p or from 270p to 1080p. VSR-HE adopts hierarchical encoding transformer blocks and has been sophisticatedly optimized to eliminate a wide range of compression artifacts commonly introduced by H.265/HEVC encoding across various quantization parameter (QP) levels. To ensure robustness and generalization, the model is trained and evaluated under diverse compression settings, allowing it to effectively restore fine-grained details and preserve visual fidelity. The proposed VSR-HE has been officially submitted to the ICME 2025 Grand Challenge on VSR for Video Conferencing (Team BVI-VSR), under both the Track 1 (General-Purpose Real-World Video Content) and Track 2 (Talking Head Videos).

Title: Performance Characterization of Continuous Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Amy S. Inwood, Peter J. Smith, Mahmoud AlaaEldin, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that can implement a phase rotation continuously over the whole surface rather than via a finite number of discrete elements. Such an RIS can be considered a design for future systems where advances in metamaterials make such an implementation feasible or as the limiting case where the number of elements in a traditional RIS increases in a given area. We derive the optimal RIS design for the single-user (SU) scenario assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) from the RIS to the base station (BS) and correlated Rayleigh fading for the other links. We also derive the associated optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its mean, a bound on the mean spectral efficiency (SE), an approximation to the SNR outage probability and an approximation to the coefficient of variation for the investigation of channel hardening.

Title: M3SD: Multi-modal, Multi-scenario and Multi-language Speaker Diarization Dataset
Authors: Shilong Wu, Hang Chen, Jun Du
Abstract: In the field of speaker diarization, the development of technology is constrained by two problems: insufficient data resources and poor generalization ability of deep learning models. To address these two problems, firstly, we propose an automated method for constructing speaker diarization datasets, which generates more accurate pseudo-labels for massive data through the combination of audio and video. Relying on this method, we have released Multi-modal, Multi-scenario and Multi-language Speaker Diarization (M3SD) datasets. This dataset is derived from real network videos and is highly diverse. In addition, we further propose a scenario-related model fine-tuning strategy. Based on the general model pre-trained using the above dataset, we combine the specific data of the target scenario (e.g., meetings) and achieve targeted optimization by using Adapter and LoRA joint fine-tuning, thus achieving the model's domain adaptation. Our dataset and code have been open-sourced at this https URL.

Abstract: We present FOMO60K, a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset of 60,529 brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans from 13,900 sessions and 11,187 subjects, aggregated from 16 publicly available sources. The dataset includes both clinical- and research-grade images, multiple MRI sequences, and a wide range of anatomical and pathological variability, including scans with large brain anomalies. Minimal preprocessing was applied to preserve the original image characteristics while reducing barriers to entry for new users. Accompanying code for self-supervised pretraining and finetuning is provided. FOMO60K is intended to support the development and benchmarking of self-supervised learning methods in medical imaging at scale.

Title: Network-Independent Incremental Passivity Conditions for Grid-Forming Inverter Control
Authors: Jared Miller, Maitraya Avadhut Desai, Xiuqiang He, Roy S. Smith, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: Grid-forming inverters control the power transfer between the AC and DC sides of an electrical grid while maintaining the frequency and voltage of the AC side. This paper focuses on ensuring large-signal stability of an electrical grid with inverter-interfaced renewable sources. We prove that the Hybrid-Angle Control (HAC) scheme for grid-forming inverters can exhibit incremental passivity properties between current and voltage at both the AC and DC ports. This incremental passivity can be certified through decentralized conditions. Inverters operating under HAC can, therefore, be connected to other passive elements (e.g. transmission lines) with an immediate guarantee of global transient stability regardless of the network topology or parameters. Passivity of Hybrid Angle Control is also preserved under small-signal (linearized) analyses, in contrast to conventional proportional droop laws that are passivity-short at low frequencies. Passivity and interconnected-stability properties are demonstrated through an example case study.

Title: Towards Reliable WMH Segmentation under Domain Shift: An Application Study using Maximum Entropy Regularization to Improve Uncertainty Estimation
Authors: Franco Matzkin, Agostina Larrazabal, Diego H Milone, Jose Dolz, Enzo Ferrante
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is crucial for clinical decision-making, particularly in the context of multiple sclerosis. However, domain shifts, such as variations in MRI machine types or acquisition parameters, pose significant challenges to model calibration and uncertainty estimation. This study investigates the impact of domain shift on WMH segmentation by proposing maximum-entropy regularization techniques to enhance model calibration and uncertainty estimation, with the purpose of identifying errors post-deployment using predictive uncertainty as a proxy measure that does not require ground-truth labels. To do this, we conducted experiments using a U-Net architecture to evaluate these regularization schemes on two publicly available datasets, assessing performance with the Dice coefficient, expected calibration error, and entropy-based uncertainty estimates. Our results show that entropy-based uncertainty estimates can anticipate segmentation errors, and that maximum-entropy regularization further strengthens the correlation between uncertainty and segmentation performance while also improving model calibration under domain shift.

Materials and Methods: We suggested novel radiomic features (concentration rate and Rényi entropy) to characterize different MS lesion types and fused these with raw imaging data. The study integrated radiomic features with imaging data through a ResNeXt-UNet architecture and attention-augmented U-Net architecture. Our approach was evaluated on scans from 46 patients (1102 slices), comparing performance before and after data fusion. Results: The radiomics-enhanced ResNeXt-UNet demonstrated high segmentation accuracy, achieving significant improvements in precision and sensitivity over the MRI-only baseline and a Dice score of 0.774$\pm$0.05; p<0.001 according to Bonferroni-adjusted Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The radiomics-enhanced attention-augmented U-Net model showed a greater model stability evidenced by reduced performance variability (SDD = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.09 vs. 0.21 $\pm$ 0.06; p=0.03) and smoother validation curves with radiomics integration. Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that fusing radiomics with raw imaging data boosts segmentation performance and stability in state-of-the-art models.

Title: Widely Linear Augmented Extreme Learning Machine Based Impairments Compensation for Satellite Communications
Authors: Yang Luo, Arunprakash Jayaprakash, Gaojie Chen, Chong Huang, Qu Luo, De Mi, Pei Xiao
Abstract: Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.

Title: The Perception of Phase Intercept Distortion and its Application in Data Augmentation
Authors: Venkatakrishnan Vaidyanathapuram Krishnan, Nathaniel Condit-Schultz
Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.

Title: Bayesian Knowledge Transfer for a Kalman Fixed-Lag Interval Smoother
Authors: Ondřej Skalský, Jakub Dokoupil
Abstract: A Bayesian knowledge transfer mechanism that leverages external information to improve the performance of the Kalman fixed-lag interval smoother (FLIS) is proposed. Exact knowledge of the external observation model is assumed to be missing, which hinders the direct application of Bayes' rule in traditional transfer learning approaches. This limitation is overcome by the fully probabilistic design, conditioning the targeted task of state estimation on external information. To mitigate the negative impact of inaccurate external data while leveraging precise information, a latent variable is introduced. Favorably, in contrast to a filter, FLIS retrospectively refines past decisions up to a fixed time horizon, reducing the accumulation of estimation error and consequently improving the performance of state inference. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm better exploits precise external knowledge compared to a similar technique and achieves comparable results when the information is imprecise.

Title: Modeling Uncertainty: From Simulink to Stochastic Hybrid Automata
Authors: Pauline Blohm, Felix Schulz, Lisa Willemsen, Anne Remke, Paula Herber
Abstract: Simulink is widely used in industrial design processes to model increasingly complex embedded control systems. Thus, their formal analysis is highly desirable. However, this comes with two major challenges: First, Simulink models often provide an idealized view of real-life systems and omit uncertainties such as, aging, sensor noise or failures. Second, the semantics of Simulink is only informally defined. In this paper, we present an approach to formally analyze safety and performance of embedded control systems modeled in Simulink in the presence of uncertainty. To achieve this, we 1) model different types of uncertainties as stochastic Simulink subsystems and 2) extend an existing formalization of the Simulink semantics based on stochastic hybrid automata (SHA) by providing transformation rules for the stochastic subsystems. Our approach gives us access to established quantitative analysis techniques, like statistical model checking and reachability analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by analyzing safety and performance in the presence of uncertainty for two smaller case studies.

Title: Optimization-Based Image Restoration under Implementation Constraints in Optical Analog Circuits
Authors: Taisei Kato, Ryo Hayakawa, Soma Furusawa, Kazunori Hayashi, Youji Iiguni
Abstract: Optical analog circuits have attracted attention as promising alternatives to traditional electronic circuits for signal processing tasks due to their potential for low-latency and low-power computations. However, implementing iterative algorithms on such circuits presents challenges, particularly due to the difficulty of performing division operations involving dynamically changing variables and the additive noise introduced by optical amplifiers. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of implementing image restoration algorithms using total variation regularization on optical analog circuits. Specifically, we design the circuit structures for the image restoration with widely used alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and primal dual splitting (PDS). Our design avoids division operations involving dynamic variables and incorporate the impact of additive noise introduced by optical amplifiers. Simulation results show that the effective denoising can be achieved in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) even when the circuit noise at the amplifiers is taken into account.

Title: Integrating Movable Antennas and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (MA-IRS): Fundamentals, Practical Solutions, and Opportunities
Authors: Qingqing Wu, Ziyuan Zheng, Ying Gao, Weidong Mei, Xin Wei, Wen Chen, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) enable active antenna repositioning and passive phase-shift tuning for channel reconfiguration, respectively. Integrating MAs and IRSs boosts spatial degrees of freedom, significantly enhancing wireless network capacity, coverage, and reliability. In this article, we first present the fundamentals of MA-IRS integration, involving clarifying the key design issues, revealing performance gain, and identifying the conditions where MA-IRS synergy persists. Then, we examine practical challenges and propose pragmatic design solutions, including optimization schemes, hardware architectures, deployment strategies, and robust designs for hardware impairments and mobility management. In addition, we highlight how MA-IRS architectures uniquely support advanced integrated sensing and communication, enhancing sensing performance and dual-functional flexibility. Overall, MA-IRS integration emerges as a compelling approach toward next-generation reconfigurable wireless systems.

Title: ASAP-FE: Energy-Efficient Feature Extraction Enabling Multi-Channel Keyword Spotting on Edge Processors
Authors: Jongin Choi, Jina Park, Woojoo Lee, Jae-Jin Lee, Massoud Pedram
Abstract: Multi-channel keyword spotting (KWS) has become crucial for voice-based applications in edge environments. However, its substantial computational and energy requirements pose significant challenges. We introduce ASAP-FE (Agile Sparsity-Aware Parallelized-Feature Extractor), a hardware-oriented front-end designed to address these challenges. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Half-overlapped Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Framing: This reduces redundant data by approximately 25% while maintaining essential phoneme transition cues. (2) Sparsity-aware Data Reduction: We exploit frame-level sparsity to achieve an additional 50% data reduction by combining frame skipping with stride-based filtering. (3) Dynamic Parallel Processing: We introduce a parameterizable filter cluster and a priority-based scheduling algorithm that allows parallel execution of IIR filtering tasks, reducing latency and optimizing energy efficiency. ASAP-FE is implemented with various filter cluster sizes on edge processors, with functionality verified on FPGA prototypes and designs synthesized at 45 nm. Experimental results using TC-ResNet8, DS-CNN, and KWT-1 demonstrate that ASAP-FE reduces the average workload by 62.73% while supporting real-time processing for up to 32 channels. Compared to a conventional fully overlapped baseline, ASAP-FE achieves less than a 1% accuracy drop (e.g., 96.22% vs. 97.13% for DS-CNN), which is well within acceptable limits for edge AI. By adjusting the number of filter modules, our design optimizes the trade-off between performance and energy, with 15 parallel filters providing optimal performance for up to 25 channels. Overall, ASAP-FE offers a practical and efficient solution for multi-channel KWS on energy-constrained edge devices.

Title: PGLib-CO2: A Power Grid Library for Computing and Optimizing Carbon Emissions
Authors: Young-ho Cho, Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu
Abstract: A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's this http URL, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.

Title: Plug-and-Play with 2.5D Artifact Reduction Prior for Fast and Accurate Industrial Computed Tomography Reconstruction
Authors: Haley Duba-Sullivan, Aniket Pramanik, Venkatakrishnan Singanallur, Amirkoushyar Ziabari
Abstract: Cone-beam X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is an essential imaging technique for generating 3D reconstructions of internal structures, with applications ranging from medical to industrial imaging. Producing high-quality reconstructions typically requires many X-ray measurements; this process can be slow and expensive, especially for dense materials. Recent work incorporating artifact reduction priors within a plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction framework has shown promising results in improving image quality from sparse-view XCT scans while enhancing the generalizability of deep learning-based solutions. However, this method uses a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for artifact reduction, which captures only slice-independent information from the 3D reconstruction, limiting performance. In this paper, we propose a PnP reconstruction method that uses a 2.5D artifact reduction CNN as the prior. This approach leverages inter-slice information from adjacent slices, capturing richer spatial context while remaining computationally efficient. We show that this 2.5D prior not only improves the quality of reconstructions but also enables the model to directly suppress commonly occurring XCT artifacts (such as beam hardening), eliminating the need for artifact correction pre-processing. Experiments on both experimental and synthetic cone-beam XCT data demonstrate that the proposed method better preserves fine structural details, such as pore size and shape, leading to more accurate defect detection compared to 2D priors. In particular, we demonstrate strong performance on experimental XCT data using a 2.5D artifact reduction prior trained entirely on simulated scans, highlighting the proposed method's ability to generalize across domains.

Title: A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes
Authors: Ankitha E Bangera ((1) Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai, Mumbai, India)
Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.

Title: Swarm-STL: A Framework for Motion Planning in Large-Scale, Multi-Swarm Systems
Authors: Shiyu Cheng, Luyao Niu, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Andrew Clark, Radha Poovendran
Abstract: In multi-agent systems, signal temporal logic (STL) is widely used for path planning to accomplish complex objectives with formal safety guarantees. However, as the number of agents increases, existing approaches encounter significant computational challenges. Recognizing that many complex tasks require cooperation among multiple agents, we propose swarm STL specifications to describe the collective tasks that need to be achieved by a team of agents. Next, we address the motion planning problem for all the agents in two stages. First, we abstract a group of cooperating agents as a swarm and construct a reduced-dimension state space whose dimension does not increase with the number of agents. The path planning is performed at the swarm level, ensuring the safety and swarm STL specifications are satisfied. Then, we design low-level control strategies for agents within each swarm based on the path synthesized in the first step. The trajectories of agents generated by the two-step policy ensure satisfaction of the STL specifications. We evaluate our two-stage approach in both single-swarm and multi-swarm scenarios. The results demonstrate that all tasks are completed with safety guarantees. Compared to the baseline multi-agent planning approach, our method maintains computational efficiency as the number of agents increases, since the computational time scales with the number of swarms rather than the number of agents.

Title: Quantum Radar and Research Assessment
Authors: Gaspare Galati, Gabriele Pavan, Frederick Daum
Abstract: Quantum Radar was studied in many Nations for about fifteen years with the production of some hundred publications. In the post 2020 literature, it is shown that, due to the exceedingly low transmitted power, Quantum Radar cannot produce neither significant results nor real world applications. Regrettably, most of the scientific community ignored this negative outcome: a fact worth of exam. A detailed study of such an assessment failure depicts the main shortcomings of the present situation, calling for a redesign of the research assessment at the international level, with proposals shown in the ending section of this paper.

Title: ReFrame: Layer Caching for Accelerated Inference in Real-Time Rendering
Authors: Lufei Liu, Tor M. Aamodt
Abstract: Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks. Code available: this https URL

Title: The Trip to ZigBee Backscatter across a Decade, a Systematic Review
Authors: Yang Liu
Abstract: The field of backscatter communication has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from a niche technology for radio-frequency identification (RFID) into a sophisticated paradigm poised to enable a truly battery-free Internet of Things (IoT). This evolution is built upon a deepening understanding of the fundamental principles governing these ultra-low-power links. Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous waves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying ambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular networks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter, particularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity wireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from foundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter to modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication architectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust synchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag coordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems highlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and range, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware. Finally, we synthesize the primary challenges, including networking scalability, security vulnerabilities, the near-far problem, and practical deployment hurdles, and outline future research directions, such as integration with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and 6G networks, that promise to further expand the capabilities of this transformative technology.

Title: Hybrid Meta-Learning Framework for Anomaly Forecasting in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Physics-Inspired Simulation and Deep Ensembles
Authors: Abdullah Burkan Bereketoglu
Abstract: We propose a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by nonstationary and stochastic behavior. The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.

Title: A Survey on World Models Grounded in Acoustic Physical Information
Authors: Xiaoliang Chen, Le Chang, Xin Yu, Yunhe Huang, Xianling Tu
Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of world models grounded in the foundation of acoustic physical information. It examines the theoretical underpinnings, essential methodological frameworks, and recent technological advancements in leveraging acoustic signals for high-fidelity environmental perception, causal physical reasoning, and predictive simulation of dynamic events. The survey explains how acoustic signals, as direct carriers of mechanical wave energy from physical events, encode rich, latent information about material properties, internal geometric structures, and complex interaction dynamics. Specifically, this survey establishes the theoretical foundation by explaining how fundamental physical laws govern the encoding of physical information within acoustic signals. It then reviews the core methodological pillars, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), generative models, and self-supervised multimodal learning frameworks. Furthermore, the survey details the significant applications of acoustic world models in robotics, autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Finally, it systematically outlines the important technical and ethical challenges while proposing a concrete roadmap for future research directions toward robust, causal, uncertainty-aware, and responsible acoustic intelligence. These elements collectively point to a research pathway towards embodied active acoustic intelligence, empowering AI systems to construct an internal "intuitive physics" engine through sound.

Title: Set theoretic solution for the tuning problem
Authors: Vsevolod Vladimirovich Deriushkin
Abstract: In this paper I want to suggest a new solution to the problem of musical tuning. On one hand, I see it as a generalization of Just Intonation (JI) to inharmonic timbers, on another, as a unification of spectral interference and harmonicity contributions to consonance within a single framework. The main achievement of the work is the ability to mathematically quantify the phenomenon of musical consonance using set theory. That quantification is done by defining two measures of consonance: affinity and harmonicity. These measures naturally generate sets of intervals that can be used as dynamic tuning systems. The paper is aimed at a broad audience of people who may not be skilled in music and tuning theory or mathematics. Thus, I attempt to give as much details and explanations as I can, while keeping the number of pages as low as possible.

Title: Making deep neural networks work for medical audio: representation, compression and domain adaptation
Authors: Charles C Onu
Abstract: This thesis addresses the technical challenges of applying machine learning to understand and interpret medical audio signals. The sounds of our lungs, heart, and voice convey vital information about our health. Yet, in contemporary medicine, these sounds are primarily analyzed through auditory interpretation by experts using devices like stethoscopes. Automated analysis offers the potential to standardize the processing of medical sounds, enable screening in low-resource settings where physicians are scarce, and detect subtle patterns that may elude human perception, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. Focusing on the analysis of infant cry sounds to predict medical conditions, this thesis contributes on four key fronts. First, in low-data settings, we demonstrate that large databases of adult speech can be harnessed through neural transfer learning to develop more accurate and robust models for infant cry analysis. Second, in cost-effective modeling, we introduce an end-to-end model compression approach for recurrent networks using tensor decomposition. Our method requires no post-hoc processing, achieves compression rates of several hundred-fold, and delivers accurate, portable models suitable for resource-constrained devices. Third, we propose novel domain adaptation techniques tailored for audio models and adapt existing methods from computer vision. These approaches address dataset bias and enhance generalization across domains while maintaining strong performance on the original data. Finally, to advance research in this domain, we release a unique, open-source dataset of infant cry sounds, developed in collaboration with clinicians worldwide. This work lays the foundation for recognizing the infant cry as a vital sign and highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven audio monitoring in shaping the future of accessible and affordable healthcare.

Title: Quadrotor Morpho-Transition: Learning vs Model-Based Control Strategies
Authors: Ioannis Mandralis, Richard M. Murray, Morteza Gharib
Abstract: Quadrotor Morpho-Transition, or the act of transitioning from air to ground through mid-air transformation, involves complex aerodynamic interactions and a need to operate near actuator saturation, complicating controller design. In recent work, morpho-transition has been studied from a model-based control perspective, but these approaches remain limited due to unmodeled dynamics and the requirement for planning through contacts. Here, we train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to learn a morpho-transition policy and demonstrate successful transfer to hardware. We find that the RL control policy achieves agile landing, but only transfers to hardware if motor dynamics and observation delays are taken into account. On the other hand, a baseline MPC controller transfers out-of-the-box without knowledge of the actuator dynamics and delays, at the cost of reduced recovery from disturbances in the event of unknown actuator failures. Our work opens the way for more robust control of agile in-flight quadrotor maneuvers that require mid-air transformation.

Title: A Hierarchical Test Platform for Vision Language Model (VLM)-Integrated Real-World Autonomous Driving
Authors: Yupeng Zhou, Can Cui, Juntong Peng, Zichong Yang, Juanwu Lu, Jitesh H Panchal, Bin Yao, Ziran Wang
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated notable promise in autonomous driving by offering the potential for multimodal reasoning through pretraining on extensive image-text pairs. However, adapting these models from broad web-scale data to the safety-critical context of driving presents a significant challenge, commonly referred to as domain shift. Existing simulation-based and dataset-driven evaluation methods, although valuable, often fail to capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios and cannot easily accommodate repeatable closed-loop testing with flexible scenario manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical real-world test platform specifically designed to evaluate VLM-integrated autonomous driving systems. Our approach includes a modular, low-latency on-vehicle middleware that allows seamless incorporation of various VLMs, a clearly separated perception-planning-control architecture that can accommodate both VLM-based and conventional modules, and a configurable suite of real-world testing scenarios on a closed track that facilitates controlled yet authentic evaluations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform`s testing and evaluation ability with a case study involving a VLM-enabled autonomous vehicle, highlighting how our test framework supports robust experimentation under diverse conditions.

Title: Acoustic scattering AI for non-invasive object classifications: A case study on hair assessment
Authors: Long-Vu Hoang, Tuan Nguyen, Tran Huy Dat
Abstract: This paper presents a novel non-invasive object classification approach using acoustic scattering, demonstrated through a case study on hair assessment. When an incident wave interacts with an object, it generates a scattered acoustic field encoding structural and material properties. By emitting acoustic stimuli and capturing the scattered signals from head-with-hair-sample objects, we classify hair type and moisture using AI-driven, deep-learning-based sound classification. We benchmark comprehensive methods, including (i) fully supervised deep learning, (ii) embedding-based classification, (iii) supervised foundation model fine-tuning, and (iv) self-supervised model fine-tuning. Our best strategy achieves nearly 90% classification accuracy by fine-tuning all parameters of a self-supervised model. These results highlight acoustic scattering as a privacy-preserving, non-contact alternative to visual classification, opening huge potential for applications in various industries.

Title: Pushing the Performance of Synthetic Speech Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Self-Supervised Learning Models
Authors: Tuan Dat Phuong, Long-Vu Hoang, Huy Dat Tran
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly advanced spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning (SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer model, have demonstrated remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron in the XLSR-Conformer model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our results on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that integrating KAN into the SSL-based models can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively on LA and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. These findings suggest that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for advances in synthetic speech detection.

Title: Can we train ASR systems on Code-switch without real code-switch data? Case study for Singapore's languages
Authors: Tuan Nguyen, Huy-Dat Tran
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), common in multilingual settings, presents challenges for ASR due to scarce and costly transcribed data caused by linguistic complexity. This study investigates building CS-ASR using synthetic CS data. We propose a phrase-level mixing method to generate synthetic CS data that mimics natural patterns. Utilizing monolingual augmented with synthetic phrase-mixed CS data to fine-tune large pretrained ASR models (Whisper, MMS, SeamlessM4T). This paper focuses on three under-resourced Southeast Asian language pairs: Malay-English (BM-EN), Mandarin-Malay (ZH-BM), and Tamil-English (TA-EN), establishing a new comprehensive benchmark for CS-ASR to evaluate the performance of leading ASR models. Experimental results show that the proposed training strategy enhances ASR performance on monolingual and CS tests, with BM-EN showing highest gains, then TA-EN and ZH-BM. This finding offers a cost-effective approach for CS-ASR development, benefiting research and industry.

Title: Hard Contacts with Soft Gradients: Refining Differentiable Simulators for Learning and Control
Authors: Anselm Paulus, A. René Geist, Pierre Schumacher, Vít Musil, Georg Martius
Abstract: Contact forces pose a major challenge for gradient-based optimization of robot dynamics as they introduce jumps in the system's velocities. Penalty-based simulators, such as MuJoCo, simplify gradient computation by softening the contact forces. However, realistically simulating hard contacts requires very stiff contact settings, which leads to incorrect gradients when using automatic differentiation. On the other hand, using non-stiff settings strongly increases the sim-to-real gap. We analyze the contact computation of penalty-based simulators to identify the causes of gradient errors. Then, we propose DiffMJX, which combines adaptive integration with MuJoCo XLA, to notably improve gradient quality in the presence of hard contacts. Finally, we address a key limitation of contact gradients: they vanish when objects do not touch. To overcome this, we introduce Contacts From Distance (CFD), a mechanism that enables the simulator to generate informative contact gradients even before objects are in contact. To preserve physical realism, we apply CFD only in the backward pass using a straight-through trick, allowing us to compute useful gradients without modifying the forward simulation.

Title: AsyncSwitch: Asynchronous Text-Speech Adaptation for Code-Switched ASR
Authors: Tuan Nguyen, Huy-Dat Tran
Abstract: Developing code-switched ASR systems is challenging due to language ambiguity and limited exposure to multilingual, code-switched data, while collecting such speech is costly. Prior work generates synthetic audio from text, but these methods are computationally intensive and hard to scale. We introduce AsyncSwitch, a novel asynchronous adaptation framework that leverages large-scale, text-rich web data to pre-expose ASR models to diverse code-switched domains before fine-tuning on paired speech-text corpora. Our three-stage process (1) trains decoder self-attention and feedforward layers on code-switched text, (2) aligns decoder and encoder via cross-attention using limited speech-text data, and (3) fully fine-tunes the entire model. Experiments with Whisper on Malay-English code-switching demonstrate a 9.02% relative WER reduction, while improving monolingual performance in Singlish, Malay, and other English variants.

Title: Pose State Perception of Interventional Robot for Cardio-cerebrovascular Procedures
Authors: Shunhan Ji, Yanxi Chen, Zhongyu Yang, Quan Zhang, Xiaohang Nie, Jingqian Sun, Yichao Tang
Abstract: In response to the increasing demand for cardiocerebrovascular interventional surgeries, precise control of interventional robots has become increasingly important. Within these complex vascular scenarios, the accurate and reliable perception of the pose state for interventional robots is particularly crucial. This paper presents a novel vision-based approach without the need of additional sensors or markers. The core of this paper's method consists of a three-part framework: firstly, a dual-head multitask U-Net model for simultaneous vessel segment and interventional robot detection; secondly, an advanced algorithm for skeleton extraction and optimization; and finally, a comprehensive pose state perception system based on geometric features is implemented to accurately identify the robot's pose state and provide strategies for subsequent control. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's high reliability and accuracy in trajectory tracking and pose state perception.

Title: A Novel Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Design for 100G Coherent Passive Optical Network
Authors: Rujia Zou, Haipeng Zhang, Karthik Sundaresan, Zhensheng Jia, Suresh Subramaniam
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in coherent Passive Optical Network (PON) technologies featuring 100G and higher data rates, this paper addresses the urgent requirement for sophisticated simulation and MAC layer development within the domain of coherent Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) PON and coherent Time and Frequency Division Multiplexing (TFDM) PON networks. The ever-growing demand for latency-sensitive services and expanding user populations in next-generation 100G and beyond coherent PONs, underscores the crucial need for low-latency bandwidth management and efficient Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) mechanisms. In this paper, we present a pioneering analysis of two established DBAs from the perspective of temporal misalignments. Subsequently, a novel DBA algorithm tailored for coherent PONs featuring 100 Gbps data rate and up to 512 end-users is introduced, named the Hybrid-Switch DBA. This innovative approach allows for adaptive switching of the DBA scheme in response to real-time traffic conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to address the misalignment problem of DBA and proposes a novel DBA solution for both TDM- and TFDM-based coherent PON networks. This research significantly contributes to the development of coherent TDM PON and coherent TFDM PON networks by enhancing the efficiency of bandwidth allocation and addressing the challenges associated with misalignments in DBA mechanisms. As optical access networks continue to evolve to meet the ever-increasing demands of modern communication services, the Hybrid-Switch DBA algorithm presented in this paper offers a promising solution for optimizing network performance and accommodating latency-sensitive applications.

Title: Fretting-Transformer: Encoder-Decoder Model for MIDI to Tablature Transcription
Authors: Anna Hamberger, Sebastian Murgul, Jochen Schmidt, Michael Heizmann
Abstract: Music transcription plays a pivotal role in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), particularly for stringed instruments like the guitar, where symbolic music notations such as MIDI lack crucial playability information. This contribution introduces the Fretting-Transformer, an encoderdecoder model that utilizes a T5 transformer architecture to automate the transcription of MIDI sequences into guitar tablature. By framing the task as a symbolic translation problem, the model addresses key challenges, including string-fret ambiguity and physical playability. The proposed system leverages diverse datasets, including DadaGP, GuitarToday, and Leduc, with novel data pre-processing and tokenization strategies. We have developed metrics for tablature accuracy and playability to quantitatively evaluate the performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the Fretting-Transformer surpasses baseline methods like A* and commercial applications like Guitar Pro. The integration of context-sensitive processing and tuning/capo conditioning further enhances the model's performance, laying a robust foundation for future developments in automated guitar transcription.

Title: SLEEPING-DISCO 9M: A large-scale pre-training dataset for generative music modeling
Authors: Tawsif Ahmed, Andrej Radonjic, Gollam Rabby
Abstract: We present Sleeping-DISCO 9M, a large-scale pre-training dataset for music and song. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source high-quality dataset representing popular and well-known songs for generative music modeling tasks such as text-music, music-captioning, singing-voice synthesis, melody reconstruction and cross-model retrieval. Past contributions focused on isolated and constrained factors whose core perspective was to create synthetic or re-recorded music corpus (e.g. GTSinger, M4Singer) and arbitrarily large-scale audio datasets (e.g. DISCO-10M and LAIONDISCO-12M) had been another focus for the community. Unfortunately, adoption of these datasets has been below substantial in the generative music community as these datasets fail to reflect real-world music and its flavour. Our dataset changes this narrative and provides a dataset that is constructed using actual popular music and world-renowned artists.

Title: Uncertainty-Driven Radar-Inertial Fusion for Instantaneous 3D Ego-Velocity Estimation
Authors: Prashant Kumar Rai, Elham Kowsari, Nataliya Strokina, Reza Ghabcheloo
Abstract: We present a method for estimating ego-velocity in autonomous navigation by integrating high-resolution imaging radar with an inertial measurement unit. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional radar-based ego-motion estimation techniques by employing a neural network to process complex-valued raw radar data and estimate instantaneous linear ego-velocity along with its associated uncertainty. This uncertainty-aware velocity estimate is then integrated with inertial measurement unit data using an Extended Kalman Filter. The filter leverages the network-predicted uncertainty to refine the inertial sensor's noise and bias parameters, improving the overall robustness and accuracy of the ego-motion estimation. We evaluated the proposed method on the publicly available ColoRadar dataset. Our approach achieves significantly lower error compared to the closest publicly available method and also outperforms both instantaneous and scan matching-based techniques.

Title: Capacity Characterization of Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: Unlike conventional systems using a fixed-location antenna, the channel capacity of the pinching-antenna system (PASS) is determined by the activated positions of pinching antennas. This article characterizes the capacity region of multiuser PASS, where a single pinched waveguide is deployed to enable both uplink and downlink communications. The capacity region of the uplink channel is first characterized. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal antenna activation position, along with the corresponding capacity region and the achievable data rate regions under time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). It is proven that the capacity region of PASS encompasses that of conventional fixed-antenna systems, and that the FDMA rate region contains the TDMA rate region. \romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived using an element-wise alternating antenna position optimization technique and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, respectively. The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework. It is proven that the relationships among the downlink capacity and rate regions are consistent with those in the uplink case. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the exact capacity region, \romannumeral2) PASS yields a significantly enlarged capacity region compared to conventional fixed-antenna systems, and \romannumeral3) in the multiple-pinch case, TDMA and FDMA are capable of approaching the channel capacity limit.

Title: Barrier Method for Inequality Constrained Factor Graph Optimization with Application to Model Predictive Control
Authors: Anas Abdelkarim, Holger Voos, Daniel Görges
Abstract: Factor graphs have demonstrated remarkable efficiency for robotic perception tasks, particularly in localization and mapping applications. However, their application to optimal control problems -- especially Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- has remained limited due to fundamental challenges in constraint handling. This paper presents a novel integration of the Barrier Interior Point Method (BIPM) with factor graphs, implemented as an open-source extension to the widely adopted g2o framework. Our approach introduces specialized inequality factor nodes that encode logarithmic barrier functions, thereby overcoming the quadratic-form limitations of conventional factor graph formulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first g2o-based implementation capable of efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints within a unified optimization backend. We validate the method through a multi-objective adaptive cruise control application for autonomous vehicles. Benchmark comparisons with state-of-the-art constraint-handling techniques demonstrate faster convergence and improved computational efficiency. (Code repository: this https URL)

Title: FGA-NN: Film Grain Analysis Neural Network
Authors: Zoubida Ameur, Frédéric Lefebvre, Philippe De Lagrange, Miloš Radosavljević
Abstract: Film grain, once a by-product of analog film, is now present in most cinematographic content for aesthetic reasons. However, when such content is compressed at medium to low bitrates, film grain is lost due to its random nature. To preserve artistic intent while compressing efficiently, film grain is analyzed and modeled before encoding and synthesized after decoding. This paper introduces FGA-NN, the first learning-based film grain analysis method to estimate conventional film grain parameters compatible with conventional synthesis. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate FGA-NN's superior balance between analysis accuracy and synthesis complexity, along with its robustness and applicability.

Title: Unifying Streaming and Non-streaming Zipformer-based ASR
Authors: Bidisha Sharma, Karthik Pandia Durai, Shankar Venkatesan, Jeena J Prakash, Shashi Kumar, Malolan Chetlur, Andreas Stolcke
Abstract: There has been increasing interest in unifying streaming and non-streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to reduce development, training, and deployment costs. We present a unified framework that trains a single end-to-end ASR model for both streaming and non-streaming applications, leveraging future context information. We propose to use dynamic right-context through the chunked attention masking in the training of zipformer-based ASR models. We demonstrate that using right-context is more effective in zipformer models compared to other conformer models due to its multi-scale nature. We analyze the effect of varying the number of right-context frames on accuracy and latency of the streaming ASR models. We use Librispeech and large in-house conversational datasets to train different versions of streaming and non-streaming models and evaluate them in a production grade server-client setup across diverse testsets of different domains. The proposed strategy reduces word error by relative 7.9\% with a small degradation in user-perceived latency. By adding more right-context frames, we are able to achieve streaming performance close to that of non-streaming models. Our approach also allows flexible control of the latency-accuracy tradeoff according to customers requirements.

Title: Fronthaul-Aware User-Centric Generalized Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Zahra Mobini, Ahmet Hasim Gokceoglu, Li Wang, Gunnar Peters, Hien Quoc Ngo
Abstract: We consider fronthaul-limited generalized zeroforcing-based cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems with multiple-antenna users and multipleantenna access points (APs) relying on both cooperative beamforming (CB) and user-centric (UC) clustering. The proposed framework is very general and can be degenerated into different special cases, such as pure CB/pure UC clustering, or fully centralized CB/fully distributed beamforming. We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the user association and power control for maximizing the sum SE. The formulated problem is under per-AP transmit power and fronthaul constraints, and is based on only long-term channel state information (CSI). The challenging formulated problem is transformed into tractable form and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve it using minorization maximization (MM) technique. We analyze the trade-offs provided by the CF-mMIMO system with different number of CB clusters, hence highlighting the importance of the appropriate choice of CB design for different system setups. Numerical results show that for the centralized CB, the proposed power optimization provides nearly 59% improvement in the average sum SE over the heuristic approach, and 312% improvement, when the distributed beamforming is employed.

Title: An Open Research Dataset of the 1932 Cairo Congress of Arab Music
Authors: Baris Bozkurt (College of Interdisciplinary Studies, Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates)
Abstract: This paper introduces ORD-CC32 , an open research dataset derived from the 1932 Cairo Congress of Arab Music recordings, a historically significant collection representing diverse Arab musical traditions. The dataset includes structured metadata, melodic and rhythmic mode tags (maqam and iqa), manually labeled tonic information, and acoustic features extracted using state-of-the-art pitch detection methods. These resources support computational studies of tuning, temperament, and regional variations in Arab music. A case study using pitch histograms demonstrates the potential for data-driven analysis of microtonal differences across regions. By making this dataset openly available, we aim to enable interdisciplinary research in computational ethnomusicology, music information retrieval (MIR), cultural studies, and digital heritage preservation. ORD-CC32 is shared on Zenodo with tools for feature extraction and metadata retrieval.

Title: Unsupervised Imaging Inverse Problems with Diffusion Distribution Matching
Authors: Giacomo Meanti, Thomas Ryckeboer, Michael Arbel, Julien Mairal
Abstract: This work addresses image restoration tasks through the lens of inverse problems using unpaired datasets. In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.

Title: Joint Error Correction and Fading Channel Estimation Enhancement Leveraging GRAND
Authors: Charles Wiame, Ken R. Duffy, Muriel Médard
Abstract: We present a novel method for error correction in the presence of fading channel estimation errors (CEE). When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.

Title: A Variational Framework for Improving Naturalness in Generative Spoken Language Models
Authors: Li-Wei Chen, Takuya Higuchi, Zakaria Aldeneh, Ahmed Hussen Abdelaziz, Alexander Rudnicky
Abstract: The success of large language models in text processing has inspired their adaptation to speech modeling. However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters. Code, samples and models are available at this https URL.

Title: Sample Complexity of the Linear Quadratic Regulator: A Reinforcement Learning Lens
Authors: Amirreza Neshaei Moghaddam, Alex Olshevsky, Bahman Gharesifard
Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.

Title: Dose-aware Diffusion Model for 3D PET Image Denoising: Multi-institutional Validation with Reader Study and Real Low-dose Data
Authors: Huidong Xie, Weijie Gan, Reimund Bayerlein, Bo Zhou, Ming-Kai Chen, Michal Kulon, Annemarie Boustani, Kuan-Yin Ko, Der-Shiun Wang, Benjamin A. Spencer, Wei Ji, Xiongchao Chen, Qiong Liu, Xueqi Guo, Menghua Xia, Yinchi Zhou, Hui Liu, Liang Guo, Hongyu An, Ulugbek S. Kamilov, Hanzhong Wang, Biao Li, Axel Rominger, Kuangyu Shi, Ge Wang, Ramsey D. Badawi, Chi Liu
Abstract: Reducing scan times, radiation dose, and enhancing image quality for lower-performance scanners, are critical in low-dose PET imaging. Deep learning techniques have been investigated for PET image denoising. However, existing models have often resulted in compromised image quality when achieving low-count/low-dose PET and have limited generalizability to different image noise-levels, acquisition protocols, and patient populations. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the new state-of-the-art generative model to generate high-quality samples and have demonstrated strong potential for medical imaging tasks. However, for low-dose PET imaging, existing diffusion models failed to generate consistent 3D reconstructions, unable to generalize across varying noise-levels, often produced visually-appealing but distorted image details, and produced images with biased tracer uptake. Here, we develop DDPET-3D, a dose-aware diffusion model for 3D low-dose PET imaging to address these challenges. Collected from 4 medical centers globally with different scanners and clinical protocols, we evaluated the proposed model using a total of 9,783 18F-FDG studies with low-dose levels ranging from 1% to 50%. With a cross-center, cross-scanner validation, the proposed DDPET-3D demonstrated its potential to generalize to different low-dose levels, different scanners, and different clinical protocols. As confirmed with reader studies performed by board-certified nuclear medicine physicians, experienced readers judged the images to be similar or superior to the full-dose images and previous DL baselines based on qualitative visual impression. Lesion-level quantitative accuracy was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation study and a lesion segmentation network. The presented results show the potential to achieve low-dose PET while maintaining image quality. Real low-dose scans was also included for evaluation.

Title: Stability of the Theta Method for Systems with Multiple Time-Delayed Variables
Authors: Andreas Bouterakos, Georgios Tzounas
Abstract: The paper focuses on the numerical stability and accuracy of implicit time-domain integration (TDI) methods when applied for the solution of a power system model impacted by time delays. Such a model is generally formulated as a set of delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs) in non index-1 Hessenberg form. In particular, the paper shows that numerically stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, such as the trapezoidal and the Theta method, can become unstable when applied to a power system that includes a significant number of delayed variables. Numerical stability is discussed through a scalar test delay differential equation, as well as through a matrix pencil approach that accounts for the DDAEs of any given dynamic power system model. Simulation results are presented in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system.

Title: Multi-Source Music Generation with Latent Diffusion
Authors: Zhongweiyang Xu, Debottam Dutta, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury
Abstract: Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at this https URL. Demos are available at this https URL.

Title: From Data to Control: A Formal Compositional Framework for Large-Scale Interconnected Networks
Authors: Omid Akbarzadeh, Amy Nejati, Abolfazl Lavaei
Abstract: We introduce a compositional data-driven methodology with noisy data for designing fully-decentralized safety controllers applicable to large-scale interconnected networks, encompassing a vast number of subsystems with unknown mathematical models. Our compositional scheme leverages the interconnection topology and breaks down the network analysis into the examination of distinct subsystems. This is accompanied by utilizing a concept of control storage certificates (CSCs) to capture joint dissipativity-type properties among subsystems. These CSCs are instrumental in a compositional derivation of a control barrier certificate (CBC) specialized for the interconnected network, thereby ensuring its safety. In our data-driven scheme, we gather only a single noise-corrupted input-state trajectory from each unknown subsystem within a specified time frame. By fulfilling a specific rank condition, this process facilitates the construction of a CSC for each subsystem. Following this, by adhering to compositional dissipativity reasoning, we compose CSCs derived from noisy data and build a CBC for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven approach significantly enhances the design of a CBC and its robust safety controller under noisy data across the interconnected network. This advancement is achieved by reducing the computational complexity from a polynomial growth in relation to network dimension, when using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, to a linear scale based on the number of subsystems. We apply our data-driven findings to a variety of benchmarks, involving physical networks with unknown models and diverse interconnection topologies.

Title: Mutual Information-oriented ISAC Beamforming Design for Large Dimensional Antenna Array
Authors: Shanfeng Xu, Yanshuo Cheng, Siqiang Wang, Xinyi Wang, Zhong Zheng, Zesong Fei
Abstract: Existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) beamforming design were mostly designed under perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), limiting their use in practical dynamic environments. In this paper, we study the beamforming design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC systems based on statistical CSI, with the weighted mutual information (MI) comprising sensing and communication perspectives adopted as the performance metric. In particular, the operator-valued free probability theory is utilized to derive the closed-form expression for the weighted MI under statistical CSI. Subsequently, an efficient projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix with the aim of maximizing the weighted this http URL results validate that the derived closed-form expression matches well with the Monte Carlo simulation results and the proposed optimization algorithm is able to improve the weighted MI significantly. We also illustrate the trade-off between sensing and communication MI.

Title: Fast Switching in Mixed-Integer Model Predictive Control
Authors: Artemi Makarow, Christian Kirches
Abstract: We derive stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control with a downstream oversampling phase. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness of model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We deduce nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility on an oversampling time grid. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments illustrate practical relevance of fast control switching.

Title: BS-LDM: Effective Bone Suppression in High-Resolution Chest X-Ray Images with Conditional Latent Diffusion Models
Authors: Yifei Sun, Zhanghao Chen, Hao Zheng, Wenming Deng, Jin Liu, Wenwen Min, Ahmed Elazab, Xiang Wan, Changmiao Wang, Ruiquan Ge
Abstract: Lung diseases represent a significant global health challenge, with Chest X-Ray (CXR) being a key diagnostic tool due to its accessibility and affordability. Nonetheless, the detection of pulmonary lesions is often hindered by overlapping bone structures in CXR images, leading to potential misdiagnoses. To address this issue, we develop an end-to-end framework called BS-LDM, designed to effectively suppress bone in high-resolution CXR images. This framework is based on conditional latent diffusion models and incorporates a multi-level hybrid loss-constrained vector-quantized generative adversarial network which is crafted for perceptual compression, ensuring the preservation of details. To further enhance the framework's performance, we utilize offset noise in the forward process, and a temporal adaptive thresholding strategy in the reverse process. These additions help minimize discrepancies in generating low-frequency information of soft tissue images. Additionally, we have compiled a high-quality bone suppression dataset named SZCH-X-Rays. This dataset includes 818 pairs of high-resolution CXR and soft tissue images collected from our partner hospital. Moreover, we processed 241 data pairs from the JSRT dataset into negative images, which are more commonly used in clinical practice. Our comprehensive experiments and downstream evaluations reveal that BS-LDM excels in bone suppression, underscoring its clinical value. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Critic Augmentation for Hierarchical Multi-Agent EV Charging Control
Authors: Lo Pang-Yun Ting, Ali Şenol, Huan-Yang Wang, Hsu-Chao Lai, Kun-Ta Chuang, Huan Liu
Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.

Title: A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering
Authors: Masahiro Kurisaki
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new asymptotic expansion approach for nonlinear filtering based on a small parameter in the system noise. This method expresses the filtering distribution as a power series in the noise level, where the coefficients can be computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. As a result, it addresses the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. In the course of our derivation, we also show that classical linear filtering and smoothing equations, namely Kalman-Bucy filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, can be obtained in a unified and transparent manner from an explicit formula for the conditional distribution of the hidden path.

Title: Automated Muscle and Fat Segmentation in Computed Tomography for Comprehensive Body Composition Analysis
Authors: Yaqian Chen, Hanxue Gu, Yuwen Chen, Jicheng Yang, Haoyu Dong, Joseph Y. Cao, Adrian Camarena, Christopher Mantyh, Roy Colglazier, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Body composition assessment using CT images can potentially be used for a number of clinical applications, including the prognostication of cardiovascular outcomes, evaluation of metabolic health, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of nutritional status, prediction of treatment response in oncology, and risk stratification for surgical and critical care outcomes. While multiple groups have developed in-house segmentation tools for this analysis, there are very limited publicly available tools that could be consistently used across different applications. To mitigate this gap, we present a publicly accessible, end-to-end segmentation and feature calculation model specifically for CT body composition analysis. Our model performs segmentation of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) across the chest, abdomen, and pelvis area in axial CT images. It also provides various body composition metrics, including muscle density, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio, muscle area/volume, and skeletal muscle index (SMI), supporting both 2D and 3D assessments. To evaluate the model, the segmentation was applied to both internal and external datasets, with body composition metrics analyzed across different age, sex, and race groups. The model achieved high dice coefficients on both internal and external datasets, exceeding 89% for skeletal muscle, SAT, and VAT segmentation. The model outperforms the benchmark by 2.40% on skeletal muscle and 10.26% on SAT compared to the manual annotations given by the publicly available dataset. Body composition metrics show mean relative absolute errors (MRAEs) under 10% for all measures. Furthermore, the model provided muscular fat segmentation with a Dice coefficient of 56.27%, which can be utilized for additional analyses as needed.

Title: System Identification Beyond the Nyquist Frequency: A Kernel-Regularized Approach
Authors: Max van Haren, Roy S. Smith, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Models that contain intersample behavior are important for control design of systems with slow-rate outputs. The aim of this paper is to develop a system identification technique for fast-rate models of systems where only slow-rate output measurements are available, e.g., vision-in-the-loop systems. In this paper, the intersample response is estimated by identifying fast-rate models through least-squares criteria, and the limitations of these models are determined. In addition, a method is developed that surpasses these limitations and is capable of estimating unique fast-rate models of arbitrary order by regularizing the least-squares estimate. The developed method utilizes fast-rate inputs and slow-rate outputs and identifies fast-rate models accurately in a single identification experiment. Finally, both simulation and experimental validation on a prototype wafer stage demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.

Title: Exact Characterization of Aggregate Flexibility via Generalized Polymatroids
Authors: Karan Mukhi, Georg Loho, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: It is well established that the aggregate flexibility inherent in populations of distributed energy resources (DERs) can be leveraged to mitigate the intermittency and uncertainty associated with renewable generation, while also providing ancillary grid services. To enable this, aggregators must effectively represent the flexibility in the populations they control to the market or system operator. A key challenge is accurately computing the aggregate flexibility of a population, which can be formally expressed as the Minkowski sum of a collection of polytopes, a problem that is generally computationally intractable. However, the flexibility polytopes of many DERs exhibit structural symmetries that can be exploited for computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce generalized polymatroids, a family of polytopes, into the flexibility aggregation literature. We demonstrate that individual flexibility sets belong to this family, enabling efficient computation of their exact Minkowski sum. For homogeneous populations of DERs we further derive simplifications that yield more succinct representations of aggregate flexibility. Additionally, we develop an efficient optimization framework over these sets and propose a vertex-based disaggregation method, to allocate aggregate flexibility among individual DERs. Finally, we validate the optimality and computational efficiency of our approach through comparisons with existing methods.

Title: 3D Brain MRI Classification for Alzheimer Diagnosis Using CNN with Data Augmentation
Authors: Thien Nhan Vo, Bac Nam Ho
Abstract: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify T1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D convolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid output. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.

Title: ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior
Authors: Zhongweiyang Xu, Xulin Fan, Zhong-Qiu Wang, Xilin Jiang, Romit Roy Choudhury
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: this https URL.

But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.

Title: Computation Capacity Maximization for Pinching Antennas-Assisted Wireless Powered MEC Systems
Authors: Peng Liu, Meng Hua, Guangji Chen, Xinyi Wang, Zesong Fei
Abstract: In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.

Authors: Weijie Yuan, Yuanhao Cui, Jiacheng Wang, Fan Liu, Geng Sun, Tao Xiang, Jie Xu, Shi Jin, Dusit Niyato, Sinem Coleri, Sumei Sun, Shiwen Mao, Abbas Jamalipour, Dong In Kim, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.

Title: Quality-aware Masked Diffusion Transformer for Enhanced Music Generation
Authors: Chang Li, Ruoyu Wang, Lijuan Liu, Jun Du, Yixuan Sun, Zilu Guo, Zhenrong Zhang, Yuan Jiang, Jianqing Gao, Feng Ma
Abstract: Text-to-music (TTM) generation, which converts textual descriptions into audio, opens up innovative avenues for multimedia creation. Achieving high quality and diversity in this process demands extensive, high-quality data, which are often scarce in available datasets. Most open-source datasets frequently suffer from issues like low-quality waveforms and low text-audio consistency, hindering the advancement of music generation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel quality-aware training paradigm for generating high-quality, high-musicality music from large-scale, quality-imbalanced datasets. Additionally, by leveraging unique properties in the latent space of musical signals, we adapt and implement a masked diffusion transformer (MDT) model for the TTM task, showcasing its capacity for quality control and enhanced musicality. Furthermore, we introduce a three-stage caption refinement approach to address low-quality captions' issue. Experiments show state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets including MusicCaps and the Song-Describer Dataset with both objective and subjective metrics.

Title: Controllable Dance Generation with Style-Guided Motion Diffusion
Authors: Hongsong Wang, Ying Zhu, Yang Zhang, Junbo Wang, Xin Geng, Liang Wang
Abstract: Dance plays an important role as an artistic form and expression in human culture, yet the creation of dance remains a challenging task. Most dance generation methods primarily rely solely on music, seldom taking into consideration intrinsic attributes such as music style or genre. In this work, we introduce Flexible Dance Generation with Style Description Prompts (DGSDP), a diffusion-based framework suitable for diversified tasks of dance generation by fully leveraging the semantics of music style. The core component of this framework is Music-Conditioned Style-Aware Diffusion (MCSAD), which comprises a Transformer-based network and a music Style Modulation module. The MCSAD seemly integrates music conditions and style description prompts into the dance generation framework, ensuring that generated dances are consistent with the music content and style. To facilitate flexible dance generation and accommodate different tasks, a spatial-temporal masking strategy is effectively applied in the backward diffusion process. The proposed framework successfully generates realistic dance sequences that are accurately aligned with music for a variety of tasks such as long-term generation, dance in-betweening, dance inpainting, and etc. We hope that this work has the potential to inspire dance generation and creation, with promising applications in entertainment, art, and education.

Title: Generative Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Data Augmentation of Cardiac Auscultation Signals: Improving Model Robustness Using Synthetic Audio
Authors: Leigh Abbott, Milan Marocchi, Matthew Fynn, Yue Rong, Sven Nordholm
Abstract: Accurately interpreting cardiac auscultation signals plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. However, the paucity of labelled data inhibits classification models' training. Researchers have turned to generative deep learning techniques combined with signal processing to augment the existing data and improve cardiac auscultation classification models to overcome this challenge. However, the primary focus of prior studies has been on model performance as opposed to model robustness. Robustness, in this case, is defined as both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance by measures such as Matthew's correlation coefficient. This work shows that more robust abnormal heart sound classifiers can be trained using an augmented dataset. The augmentations consist of traditional audio approaches and the creation of synthetic audio conditionally generated using the WaveGrad and DiffWave diffusion models. It is found that both the in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance can be improved over various datasets when training a convolutional neural network-based classification model with this augmented dataset. With the performance increase encompassing not only accuracy but also balanced accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient, an augmented dataset significantly contributes to resolving issues of imbalanced datasets. This, in turn, helps provide a more general and robust classifier.

Title: DFT-s-OFDM-based On-Off Keying for Low-Power Wake-Up Signal
Authors: Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval, Xiaolei Tie
Abstract: 5G-Advanced and likely 6G will support a new low-power wake-up signal (LP-WUS) enabling low-power devices, equipped with a complementary ultra low-power receiver to monitor wireless traffic, to completely switch off their main radio. This orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signal will emulate an on-off keying (OOK) modulation to enable very low-energy envelope detection at the receiver. Higher rate LP-WUS, containing multiple OOK symbols within single OFDM symbol, will be generated using the time-domain pulse multiplexing of discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) OFDM. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive signal design framework for DFT-s-OFDM-based OOK generation. General properties of subcarrier coefficients are derived demonstrating that only DFT of the bits needs to be computed online and repeated over the band before applying appropriate frequency-domain processing. The conventional approach of generating rectangular-like OOK waveforms is then addressed by a combination of pre-DFT bit-spreading and post-DFT processing; and the least-squares (LS) method from Mazloum and Edfors, proposed for 5G LP-WUS and also Ambient-IoT, is shown to be implementable as such. Even though aesthetically pleasing and of independent interest, rectangular-like OOK waveforms are not optimal for 5G LP-WUS scenarios due to their limited robustness to channel frequency-selectivity and timing offset, and so shaping methods for spreading the OOK spectrum and concentrating the OOK symbol energy are analyzed and shown to improve the bit error rate performance under practical conditions.

Title: Contrast-Optimized Basis Functions for Self-Navigated Motion Correction in Quantitative MRI
Authors: Elisa Marchetto, Sebastian Flassbeck, Andrew Mao, Jakob Assländer
Abstract: Purpose: The long scan times of quantitative MRI techniques make motion artifacts more likely. For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can be addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on reconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the SVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast between tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The purpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between two types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates. Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain parenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean autocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain orthogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying motion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging. Results: A comparative analysis shows that the contrast-optimized basis significantly improve the parenchyma-CSF contrast, leading to smoother motion estimates and reduced artifacts in the quantitative maps. Conclusion: The proposed contrast-optimized subspace improves the accuracy of the motion estimation.

Title: Exploring Linear Attention Alternative for Single Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Rongchang Lu, Changyu Li, Donghang Li, Guojing Zhang, Jianqiang Huang, Xilai Li
Abstract: Deep learning-based single-image super-resolution (SISR) technology focuses on enhancing low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones. Although significant progress has been made, challenges remain in computational complexity and quality, particularly in remote sensing image processing. To address these issues, we propose our Omni-Scale RWKV Super-Resolution (OmniRWKVSR) model which presents a novel approach that combines the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture with feature extraction techniques such as Visual RWKV Spatial Mixing (VRSM) and Visual RWKV Channel Mixing (VRCM), aiming to overcome the limitations of existing methods and achieve superior SISR performance. This work has proved able to provide effective solutions for high-quality image reconstruction. Under the 4x Super-Resolution tasks, compared to the MambaIR model, we achieved an average improvement of 0.26% in PSNR and 0.16% in SSIM.

Title: Target Speaker Extraction through Comparing Noisy Positive and Negative Audio Enrollments
Authors: Shitong Xu, Yiyuan Yang, Niki Trigoni, Andrew Markham
Abstract: Target speaker extraction focuses on isolating a specific speaker's voice from an audio mixture containing multiple speakers. To provide information about the target speaker's identity, prior works have utilized clean audio samples as conditioning inputs. However, such clean audio examples are not always readily available. For instance, obtaining a clean recording of a stranger's voice at a cocktail party without leaving the noisy environment is generally infeasible. Limited prior research has explored extracting the target speaker's characteristics from noisy enrollments, which may contain overlapping speech from interfering speakers. In this work, we explore a novel enrollment strategy that encodes target speaker information from the noisy enrollment by comparing segments where the target speaker is talking (Positive Enrollments) with segments where the target speaker is silent (Negative Enrollments). Experiments show the effectiveness of our model architecture, which achieves over 2.1 dB higher SI-SNRi compared to prior works in extracting the monaural speech from the mixture of two speakers. Additionally, the proposed two-stage training strategy accelerates convergence, reducing the number of optimization steps required to reach 3 dB SNR by 60\%. Overall, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the monaural target speaker extraction conditioned on noisy enrollments.

Title: Fast Contact Detection via Fusion of Joint and Inertial Sensors for Parallel Robots in Human-Robot Collaboration
Authors: Aran Mohammad, Jan Piosik, Dustin Lehmann, Thomas Seel, Moritz Schappler
Abstract: Fast contact detection is crucial for safe human-robot collaboration. Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.

Title: TIP-Search: Time-Predictable Inference Scheduling for Market Prediction under Uncertain Load
Authors: Xibai Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks. They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

Title: Seewo's Submission to MLC-SLM: Lessons learned from Speech Reasoning Language Models
Authors: Bo Li, Chengben Xu, Wufeng Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents Seewo's systems for both tracks of the Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge (MLC-SLM), addressing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization with ASR (SD-ASR). We introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that explicitly enhances reasoning and self-correction in speech language models for ASR. Our approach combines curriculum learning for progressive capability acquisition, Chain-of-Thought data augmentation to foster intermediate reflection, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further refine self-correction through reward-driven optimization. This approach achieves substantial improvements over the official challenge baselines. On the evaluation set, our best system attains a WER/CER of 11.57% for Track 1 and a tcpWER/tcpCER of 17.67% for Track 2. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component under challenge constraints.
