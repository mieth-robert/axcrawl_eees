Title: PRREACH: Probabilistic Risk Assessment Using Reachability for UAV Control
Authors: Nicole Fronda, Hariharan Narayanan, Sadia Afrin Ananna, Steven Weber, Houssam Abbas
Abstract: We present a new approach for designing risk-bounded controllers for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Existing frameworks for assessing risk of UAV operations rely on knowing the conditional probability of an incident occurring given different causes. Limited data for computing these probabilities makes real-world implementation of these frameworks difficult. Furthermore, existing frameworks do not include control methods for risk mitigation. Our approach relies on UAV dynamics, and employs reachability analysis for a probabilistic risk assessment over all feasible UAV trajectories. We use this holistic risk assessment to formulate a control optimization problem that minimally changes a UAV's existing control law to be bounded by an accepted risk threshold. We call our approach PRReach. Public and readily available UAV dynamics models and open source spatial data for mapping hazard outcomes enables practical implementation of PRReach for both offline pre-flight and online in-flight risk assessment and mitigation. We evaluate PRReach through simulation experiments on real-world data. Results show that PRReach controllers reduce risk by up to 24% offline, and up to 53% online from classical controllers.

Title: Memristor-Based Neural Network Accelerators for Space Applications: Enhancing Performance with Temporal Averaging and SIRENs
Authors: Zacharia A. Rudge, Dominik Dold, Moritz Fieback, Dario Izzo, Said Hamdioui
Abstract: Memristors are an emerging technology that enables artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness -- properties that are vital for the deployment of AI on-board spacecraft. However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability, conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation. In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \& control and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers, and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around $0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of memristors.

Title: Indifference-Zone Relaxation Procedures for Finding Feasible Systems
Authors: Yuwei Zhou, Sigrún Andradóttir, Seong-Hee Kim, Chuljin Park
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding feasible systems with respect to stochastic constraints when system performance is evaluated through simulation. Our objective is to solve this problem with high computational efficiency and statistical validity. Existing indifference-zone (IZ) procedures introduce a fixed tolerance level, which denotes how much deviation the decision-maker is willing to accept from the threshold in the constraint. These procedures are developed under the assumption that all systems' performance measures are exactly the tolerance level away from the threshold, leading to unnecessary simulations. In contrast, IZ-free procedures, which eliminate the tolerance level, perform well when systems' performance measures are far from the threshold. However, they may significantly underperform compared to IZ procedures when systems' performance measures are close to the threshold. To address these challenges, we propose the Indifference-Zone Relaxation (IZR) procedure, IZR introduces a set of relaxed tolerance levels and utilizes two subroutines for each level: one to identify systems that are clearly feasible and the other to exclude those that are clearly infeasible. We also develop the IZR procedure with estimation (IZE), which introduces two relaxed tolerance levels for each system and constraint: one matching the original tolerance level and the other based on an estimate of the system's performance measure. By employing different tolerance levels, these procedures facilitate early feasibility determination with statistical validity. We prove that IZR and IZE determine system feasibility with the desired probability and show through experiments that they significantly reduce the number of observations required compared to an existing procedure.

Title: Resource-Oriented Optimization of Electric Vehicle Systems: A Data-Driven Survey on Charging Infrastructure, Scheduling, and Fleet Management
Authors: Hai Wang, Baoshen Guo, Xiaolei Zhou, Shuai Wang, Zhiqing Hong, Tian He
Abstract: Driven by growing concerns over air quality and energy security, electric vehicles (EVs) has experienced rapid development and are reshaping global transportation systems and lifestyle patterns. Compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, EVs offer significant advantages in terms of lower energy consumption, reduced emissions, and decreased operating costs. However, there are still some core challenges to be addressed: (i) Charging station congestion and operational inefficiencies during peak hours, (ii) High charging cost under dynamic electricity pricing schemes, and (iii) Conflicts between charging needs and passenger service this http URL, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of data-driven models and approaches proposed in the literature to address the above challenges. These studies cover the entire lifecycle of EV systems, including charging station deployment, charging scheduling strategies, and large-scale fleet management. Moreover, we discuss the broader implications of EV integration across multiple domains, such as human mobility, smart grid infrastructure, and environmental sustainability, and identify key opportunities and directions for future research.

Title: Communication-Efficient Collaborative LLM Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding
Authors: Ce Zheng, Tingting Yang
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is well-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end devices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing distributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary probability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model at the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme, where the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the corresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference performance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft length that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis of the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Adaptive Covariance Steering
Authors: Aditya Gahlawat, Vivek Khatana, Duo Wang, Sambhu H. Karumanchi, Naira Hovakimyan, Petros Voulgaris
Abstract: We present a methodology for predictable and safe covariance steering control of uncertain nonlinear stochastic processes. The systems under consideration are subject to general uncertainties, which include unbounded random disturbances (aleatoric uncertainties) and incomplete model knowledge (state-dependent epistemic uncertainties). These general uncertainties lead to temporally evolving state distributions that are entirely unknown, can have arbitrary shapes, and may diverge unquantifiably from expected behaviors, leading to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors. Our method relies on an $\mathcal{L}_1$-adaptive control architecture that ensures robust control of uncertain stochastic processes while providing Wasserstein metric certificates in the space of probability measures. We show how these distributional certificates can be incorporated into the high-level covariance control steering to guarantee safe control. Unlike existing distributionally robust planning and control methodologies, our approach avoids difficult-to-verify requirements like the availability of finite samples from the true underlying distribution or an a priori knowledge of time-varying ambiguity sets to which the state distributions are assumed to belong.

Title: $\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC: Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control
Authors: Aditya Gahlawat, Sambhu H. Karumanchi, Naira Hovakimyan
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning methodologies have attracted considerable attention for the control and estimation of dynamical systems. However, such implementations suffer from a lack of predictability and robustness. Thus, adoption of data-driven tools has been minimal for safety-aware applications despite their impressive empirical results. While classical tools like robust adaptive control can ensure predictable performance, their consolidation with data-driven methods remains a challenge and, when attempted, leads to conservative results. The difficulty of consolidation stems from the inherently different `spaces' that robust control and data-driven methods occupy. Data-driven methods suffer from the distribution-shift problem, which current robust adaptive controllers can only tackle if using over-simplified learning models and unverifiable assumptions. In this paper, we present $\mathcal{L}_1$ distributionally robust adaptive control ($\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC): a control methodology for uncertain stochastic processes that guarantees robustness certificates in terms of uniform (finite-time) and maximal distributional deviation. We leverage the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control methodology to ensure the existence of Wasserstein ambiguity set around a nominal distribution, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution. The uniform ambiguity set produces an ambiguity tube of distributions centered on the nominal temporally-varying nominal distribution. The designed controller generates the ambiguity tube in response to both epistemic (model uncertainties) and aleatoric (inherent randomness and disturbances) uncertainties.

Title: On Time Delay Interpolation for Improved Acoustic Reflector Localization
Authors: Hannes Rosseel, Toon van Waterschoot
Abstract: The localization of acoustic reflectors is a fundamental component in various applications, including room acoustics analysis, sound source localization, and acoustic scene analysis. Time Delay Estimation (TDE) is essential for determining the position of reflectors relative to a sensor array. Traditional TDE algorithms generally yield time delays that are integer multiples of the operating sampling period, potentially lacking sufficient time resolution. To achieve subsample TDE accuracy, various interpolation methods, including parabolic, Gaussian, frequency, and sinc interpolation, have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive study on time delay interpolation to achieve subsample accuracy for acoustic reflector localization in reverberant conditions. We derive the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula from the previously proposed sinc interpolation in the context of short-time windowed TDE for acoustic reflector localization. Simulations show that sinc and Whittaker-Shannon interpolation outperform existing methods in terms of time delay error and positional error for critically sampled and band-limited reflections. Performance is evaluated on real-world measurements from the MYRiAD dataset, showing that sinc and Whittaker-Shannon interpolation consistently provide reliable performance across different sensor-source pairs and loudspeaker positions. These results can enhance the precision of acoustic reflector localization systems, vital for applications such as room acoustics analysis, sound source localization, and acoustic scene analysis.

Title: DarkStream: real-time speech anonymization with low latency
Authors: Waris Quamer, Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna
Abstract: We propose DarkStream, a streaming speech synthesis model for real-time speaker anonymization. To improve content encoding under strict latency constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving real-time speech communication.

Title: Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Mayur S Gowda, John Shi, Augusto Santos, José M. F. Moura
Abstract: Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.

Title: Say More with Less: Variable-Frame-Rate Speech Tokenization via Adaptive Clustering and Implicit Duration Coding
Authors: Rui-Chen Zheng, Wenrui Liu, Hui-Peng Du, Qinglin Zhang, Chong Deng, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Existing speech tokenizers typically assign a fixed number of tokens per second, regardless of the varying information density or temporal fluctuations in the speech signal. This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models. Speech samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Tangential Velocity Estimation Using Near-Field Automotive Radar Model
Authors: Michael Shifrin, Joseph Tabrikian, Igal Bilik
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of tangential velocity estimation in automotive radar systems, addressing the limitations of conventionally considered models. Conventional automotive radars are usually based on far-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential component of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for reliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we introduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration elements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space. Conventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood function for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is correctly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential velocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential velocity estimation using the Cramér-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The insights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration and the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based algorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity estimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition to tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood smearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the theoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both single- and multi-target scenarios. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and reliability of automotive radars, enhancing situational awareness for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.

Title: Bayesian Diagnosability and Active Fault Identification
Authors: Chun-Wei Kong, Jay McMahon, Morteza Lahijanian
Abstract: We study fault identification in discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to additive Gaussian white noise. We introduce a Bayesian framework that explicitly accounts for unmodeled faults under reasonable assumptions. Our approach hinges on a new quantitative diagnosability definition, revealing when passive fault identification (FID) is fundamentally limited by the given control sequence. To overcome such limitations, we propose an active FID strategy that designs control inputs for better fault identification. Numerical studies on a two-water tank system and a Mars satellite with complex and discontinuous dynamics demonstrate that our method significantly reduces failure rates with shorter identification delays compared to purely passive techniques.

Title: Environment-Aware IRS Deployment via Channel Knowledge Map: Joint Sensing-Communications Coverage Optimization
Authors: Yilong Chen, Zixiang Ren, Jie Xu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: This paper studies the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment optimization problem for IRS-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, in which multiple IRSs are strategically deployed at candidate locations to assist a base station (BS) to enhance the coverage of both sensing and communications. We present an environment-aware IRS deployment design via exploiting the channel knowledge map (CKM), which provides the channel state information (CSI) between each candidate IRS location and BS or targeted sensing/communication points. Based on the obtained CSI from CKM, we optimize the deployment of IRSs, jointly with the BS's transmit beamforming and IRSs' reflective beamforming during operation, with the objective of minimizing the system cost, while guaranteeing the minimum illumination power requirements at sensing areas and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements at communication areas. In particular, we consider two cases when the IRSs' reflective beamforming optimization can be implemented dynamically in real time and quasi-stationarily over the whole operation period, respectively. For both cases, the joint IRS deployment and transmit/reflective beamforming designs are formulated as mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems, which are solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based relax-and-bound method. Specifically, we first relax the binary IRS deployment indicators into continuous variables, then find converged solutions via SCA, and finally round relaxed indicators back to binary values. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in reducing the system cost while meeting the sensing and communication requirements.

Title: SREC: Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication
Authors: Zhidi Zhang, Rui Meng, Song Gao, Haixiao Gao, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a typical paradigm of deep integration between artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technology, significantly improves communication efficiency and resource utilization efficiency. However, the security issues of SemCom are becoming increasingly prominent. Semantic features transmitted in plaintext over physical channels are easily intercepted by eavesdroppers. To address this issue, this paper proposes Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication (SREC) to secure SemCom. SREC uses the modulo-256 encryption method to encrypt semantic features, and employs super-resolution reconstruction method to improve the reconstruction quality of images. The simulation results show that in the additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) channel, when different modulation methods are used, SREC can not only stably guarantee security, but also achieve better transmission performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Title: KGRAG-SC: Knowledge Graph RAG-Assisted Semantic Communication
Authors: Dayu Fan, Rui Meng, Song Gao, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: The state-of-the-art semantic communication (SC) schemes typically rely on end-to-end deep learning frameworks that lack interpretability and struggle with robust semantic selection and reconstruction under noisy conditions. To address this issue, this paper presents KGRAG-SC, a knowledge graph-assisted SC framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation principles. KGRAG-SC employs a multi-dimensional knowledge graph, enabling efficient semantic extraction through community-guided entity linking and GraphRAG-assisted processing. The transmitter constructs minimal connected subgraphs that capture essential semantic relationships and transmits only compact entity indices rather than full text or semantic triples. An importance-aware adaptive transmission strategy provides unequal error protection based on structural centrality metrics, prioritizing critical semantic elements under adverse channel conditions. At the receiver, large language models perform knowledge-driven text reconstruction using the shared knowledge graph as structured context, ensuring robust semantic recovery even with partial information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that KGRAG-SC achieves superior semantic fidelity in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while significantly reducing transmission overhead compared to traditional communication methods, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating structured knowledge representation with generative language models for SC systems.

Title: SemSteDiff: Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication
Authors: Song Gao, Rui Meng, Xiaodong Xu, Haixiao Gao, Yiming Liu, Chenyuan Feng, Ping Zhang, Tony Q. S. Quek, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a novel paradigm for future communication systems, has recently attracted much attention due to its superiority in communication efficiency. However, similar to traditional communication, it also suffers from eavesdropping threats. Intelligent eavesdroppers could launch advanced semantic analysis techniques to infer secret semantic information. Therefore, some researchers have designed Semantic Steganography Communication (SemSteCom) scheme to confuse semantic eavesdroppers. However, the state-of-the-art SemSteCom schemes for image transmission rely on the pre-selected cover image, which limits the universality. To address this issue, we propose a Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication (SemSteDiff) scheme to hide secret images into generated stego images. The semantic related private and public keys enable legitimate receiver to decode secret images correctly while the eavesdropper without completely true key-pairs fail to obtain them. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the plug-and-play design in different Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) frameworks. The comparison results under different eavesdroppers' threats show that, when Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) = 0 dB, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the legitimate receiver is 4.14 dB higher than that of the eavesdropper.

Title: AI-Driven Fronthaul Link Compression in Wireless Communication Systems: Review and Method Design
Authors: Keqin Zhang
Abstract: Modern fronthaul links in wireless systems must transport high-dimensional signals under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints, which makes compression indispensable. Traditional strategies such as compressed sensing, scalar quantization, and fixed-codec pipelines often rely on restrictive priors, degrade sharply at high compression ratios, and are hard to tune across channels and deployments. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought end-to-end learned transforms, vector and hierarchical quantization, and learned entropy models that better exploit the structure of Channel State Information(CSI), precoding matrices, I/Q samples, and LLRs. This paper first surveys AI-driven compression techniques and then provides a focused analysis of two representative high-compression routes: CSI feedback with end-to-end learning and Resource Block (RB) granularity precoding optimization combined with compression. Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul compression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets high compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized cooperative transmission in next-generation networks.

Title: AURAD: Anatomy-Pathology Unified Radiology Synthesis with Progressive Representations
Authors: Shuhan Ding, Jingjing Fu, Yu Gu, Naiteek Sangani, Mu Wei, Paul Vozila, Nan Liu, Jiang Bian, Hoifung Poon
Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings. However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.

Title: Layer-wise Analysis for Quality of Multilingual Synthesized Speech
Authors: Erica Cooper, Takuma Okamoto, Yamato Ohtani, Tomoki Toda, Hisashi Kawai
Abstract: While supervised quality predictors for synthesized speech have demonstrated strong correlations with human ratings, their requirement for in-domain labeled training data hinders their generalization ability to new domains. Unsupervised approaches based on pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) based models and automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are a promising alternative; however, little is known about how these models encode information about speech quality. Towards the goal of better understanding how different aspects of speech quality are encoded in a multilingual setting, we present a layer-wise analysis of multilingual pretrained speech models based on reference modeling. We find that features extracted from early SSL layers show correlations with human ratings of synthesized speech, and later layers of ASR models can predict quality of non-neural systems as well as intelligibility. We also demonstrate the importance of using well-matched reference data.

Title: Plug-and-Play Latent Diffusion for Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering with Application to Brain Imaging
Authors: Rui Guo, Yi Zhang, Yhonatan Kvich, Tianyao Huang, Maokun Li, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) imaging is an important tool for non-invasive sensing with low-cost and portable devices. One emerging application is EM stroke imaging, which enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of brain strokes. Quantitative imaging is achieved by solving an inverse scattering problem (ISP) that reconstructs permittivity and conductivity maps from measurements. In general, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by its inherent nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Existing methods, including learning-free and learning-based approaches, fail to either incorporate complicated prior distributions or provide theoretical guarantees, posing difficulties in balancing interpretability, distortion error, and reliability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a posterior sampling method based on latent diffusion for quantitative EM brain imaging, adapted from a generative plug-and-play (PnP) posterior sampling framework. Our approach allows to flexibly integrate prior knowledge into physics-based inversion without requiring paired measurement-label datasets. We first learn the prior distribution of targets from an unlabeled dataset, and then incorporate the learned prior into posterior sampling. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model on permittivity and conductivity maps to capture their prior distribution. Then, given measurements and the forward model describing EM wave physics, we perform posterior sampling by alternating between two samplers that respectively enforce the likelihood and prior distributions. Finally, reliable reconstruction is obtained through minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation based on the samples. Experimental results on brain imaging demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and structural similarity while maintaining high measurement fidelity.

Title: Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization
Authors: Yunpu Zhang, Changsheng You, Hing Cheung So, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.

Title: Multi-modal Uncertainty Robust Tree Cover Segmentation For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
Authors: Yuanyuan Gui, Wei Li, Yinjian Wang, Xiang-Gen Xia, Mauro Marty, Christian Ginzler, Zuyuan Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images have significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting applications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment. Integrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown superior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are often acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may occur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and variations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce cross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can severely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose MURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and leverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling patch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent representation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the primary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism, producing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient magnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are further integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.

Title: Movable IRS-Aided ISAC Systems: Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization
Authors: Yue Geng, Tee Hiang Cheng, Kai Zhong, Kah Chan Teh, Qingqing Wu
Abstract: Driven by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies, movable IRS (MIRS) has been proposed to improve the adaptability and performance of conventional IRS, enabling flexible adjustment of the IRS reflecting element positions. This paper investigates MIRS-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The objective is to minimize the power required for satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) of sensing and communication by jointly optimizing the MIRS element positions, IRS reflection coefficients, transmit beamforming, and receive filters. To balance the performance-cost trade-off, we proposed two MIRS schemes: element-wise control and array-wise control, where the positions of individual reflecting elements and arrays consisting of multiple elements are controllable, respectively. To address the joint beamforming and position optimization, a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed, where the variables are updated over a constructed product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) in parallel via penalty-based transformation and Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIRS outperforms conventional IRS in power minimization with both element-wise control and array-wise control. Specifically, with different system parameters, the minimum power is achieved by the MIRS with the element-wise control scheme, while suboptimal solution and higher computational efficiency are achieved by the MIRS with array-wise control scheme.

Title: Performance Analysis of Pinching-Antenna-Enabled Internet of Things Systems
Authors: Han Zhang, Bingxin Zhang, Yizhe Zhao, Kun Yang, Guopeng Zhang
Abstract: The pinching-antenna systems (PASS), which activate small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide, has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for flexible antenna deployment in next-generation wireless communication networks. While most existing studies assume rectangular indoor layouts with full coverage waveguide, practical deployments may involve geometric constraints, partial coverage, and non-negligible waveguide attenuation. This paper presents the first analytical investigation of PASS in a circular indoor environment, encompassing both full coverage and partial coverage waveguide configurations with/without propagation loss. A unified geometric-propagation framework is developed that jointly captures pinching-antenna placement, Internet of Things (IoT) device location distribution, and waveguide attenuation. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average achievable rate are derived for four scenarios, with accuracy validated via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The analysis reveals that, under the partial coverage waveguide scenario with propagation loss, the system performance demonstrates a non-monotonic trend with respect to the waveguide length, and the optimal length decreases as the attenuation coefficient increases. Numerical results further quantify the interplay between deployment strategy, waveguide propagation loss, and coverage geometry, offering practical guidelines for performance-oriented PASS design.

Title: INR meets Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Natascha Niessen, Carolin M. Pirkl, Ana Beatriz Solana, Hannah Eichhorn, Veronika Spieker, Wenqi Huang, Tim Sprenger, Marion I. Menzel, Julia A. Schnabel (on behalf of the PREDICTOM consortium)
Abstract: Multi-contrast MRI sequences allow for the acquisition of images with varying tissue contrast within a single scan. The resulting multi-contrast images can be used to extract quantitative information on tissue microstructure. To make such multi-contrast sequences feasible for clinical routine, the usually very long scan times need to be shortened e.g. through undersampling in k-space. However, this comes with challenges for the reconstruction. In general, advanced reconstruction techniques such as compressed sensing or deep learning-based approaches can enable the acquisition of high-quality images despite the acceleration. In this work, we leverage redundant anatomical information of multi-contrast sequences to achieve even higher acceleration rates. We use undersampling patterns that capture the contrast information located at the k-space center, while performing complementary undersampling across contrasts for high frequencies. To reconstruct this highly sparse k-space data, we propose an implicit neural representation (INR) network that is ideal for using the complementary information acquired across contrasts as it jointly reconstructs all contrast images. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed INR method by applying it to multi-contrast MRI using the MPnRAGE sequence, where it outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel imaging compressed sensing (PICS) reconstruction method, even at higher acceleration factors.

Title: Coupled tensor models for probability mass function estimation: Part I, Principles and algorithms
Authors: Philippe Flores (CNRS, UGA, Grenoble INP, GIPSA-lab), Konstantin Usevich (CRAN, CNRS, UL), David Brie (CRAN, CNRS, UL)
Abstract: In this article, a Probability Mass Function (PMF) estimation method which tames the curse of dimensionality is proposed. This method, called Partial Coupled Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D, has for principle to partially couple order-3 data projections -- seen as order-3 tensors -- to obtain a tensor decomposition of the probability mass tensor. The novelty of PCTF3D relies on partial coupling which consists in choosing a subset of 3D marginals. The choice of marginals is then formulated with hypergraphs. After presenting possible coupling strategies, some numerical experiments and an application of the method are proposed. This article is the first of a two-part article. While this first article focuses on a new algorithmic framework for PMF estimation, the second studies uniqueness properties of the model introduced in this article.

Title: Coupled tensor models for probability mass function estimation: Part II, Uniqueness of the model
Authors: Philippe Flores (CNRS, UGA, Grenoble INP, GIPSA-lab), Konstantin Usevich (CRAN, CNRS, UL), David Brie (CRAN, CNRS, UL)
Abstract: In this paper, uniqueness properties of a coupled tensor model are studied. This new coupled tensor model is used in a new method called Partial Coupled Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D. This method performs estimation of probability mass functions by coupling 3D marginals, seen as order-3 tensors. The core novelty of PCTF3D's approach (detailed in the part I article) relies on the partial coupling which consists on the choice of 3D marginals to be coupled. Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical learning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties. In this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled low-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled model are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the coupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum recoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article are examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an identifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits enhancing sufficient bounds of the literature.

Title: ROPE: A Novel Method for Real-Time Phase Estimation of Complex Biological Rhythms
Authors: Antonio Spallone, Marco Coraggio, Francesco De Lellis, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: Accurate phase estimation -- the process of assigning phase values between $0$ and $2\pi$ to repetitive or periodic signals -- is a cornerstone in the analysis of oscillatory signals across diverse fields, from neuroscience to robotics, where it is fundamental, e.g., to understanding coordination in neural networks, cardiorespiratory coupling, and human-robot interaction. However, existing methods are often limited to offline processing and/or constrained to one-dimensional signals. In this paper, we introduce ROPE, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first phase-estimation algorithm capable of (i) handling signals of arbitrary dimension and (ii) operating in real-time, with minimal error. ROPE identifies repetitions within the signal to segment it into (pseudo-)periods and assigns phase values by performing efficient, tractable searches over previous signal segments. We extensively validate the algorithm on a variety of signal types, including trajectories from chaotic dynamical systems, human motion-capture data, and electrocardiographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that ROPE is robust against noise and signal drift, and achieves significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art phase estimation methods. This advancement enables real-time analysis of complex biological rhythms, opening new pathways, for example, for early diagnosis of pathological rhythm disruptions and developing rhythm-based therapeutic interventions in neurological and cardiovascular disorders.

Title: Estimating Cellular Network Delays in Finnish Railways: A Machine Learning Enhanced Approach
Authors: Saeideh Mansouri, Mohamed Shamekh, Simon Indola, Petri Mahonen
Abstract: There is growing interest in using public cellular networks for specialized communication applications, replacing standalone sector-specific networks. One such application is transitioning from the aging GSM-R railway network to public 4G and 5G networks. Finland is modernizing its railway communication system through the Digirail project, leveraging public cellular networks. To evaluate network performance, a nationwide measurement campaign was conducted in two modes: Best Quality and Packet Replication. However, Best Quality mode introduces artificial delays, making it unsuitable for real-world assessments. In this paper, railway network delays are modeled using machine learning based on measurements from the Packet Replication mode. The best-performing model is then employed to generate a dataset estimating network delays across Finland's railway network. This dataset provides a more accurate representation of network performance. Machine learning based network performance prediction is shown to be feasible, and the results indicate that Finland's public cellular network can meet the stringent performance requirements of railway network control.

Title: StimulHeat: a Low-Energy Wearable Thermal Feedback Device Using Peltier Elements with Heat Flow Controlled Loop for Hand Interactions in Virtual Reality
Authors: Matthieu Mesnage, Sophie Villenave, Bertrand Massot, Matthieu Blanchard, Pierre Raimbaud, Guillaume Lavoué, Claudine Gehin
Abstract: Nowadays, the majority of wearable thermal feedback systems designed for use in virtual reality applications are not compatible or not integrated to standard controllers and are based on temperature control. The objectives of the present work is to enable integration with existing controllers, in this case Valve Index controllers, and to propose an alternative approach to managing thermal stimulation with Peltier modules by controlling heat flow instead of temperature. We introduce StimulHeat as a wireless, low power thermal feedback system, based on the continuous relationship between heat and current injection in thermoelectric device (TED). First, we designed an optimized TED driver capable of injecting a continuous, bidirectional current into the TED, thereby driving it as a heater or cooler. Subsequently, this driver was implemented in an electronic board to include temperature and heat flow control loops, as well as Bluetooth Low Energy interface for remote control. A mechanical integration was conducted, in the form of a controller extension which is non-intrusive and can be clipped to Valve Index controllers to enclose the TED, temperature sensors and electronics. Finally, we present a user study validating StimulHeat for use in Virtual Reality, utilizing a Unity-built virtual environment with our open-source package.

Title: Lightweight DNN for Full-Band Speech Denoising on Mobile Devices: Exploiting Long and Short Temporal Patterns
Authors: Konstantinos Drossos, Mikko Heikkinen, Paschalis Tsiaflakis
Abstract: Speech denoising (SD) is an important task of many, if not all, modern signal processing chains used in devices and for everyday-life applications. While there are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods for SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile devices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on full-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency cases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight DNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal patterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing look-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent neural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal and estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis taking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired by MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise normalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a modern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech denoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and low latency SD methods.

Title: VLSM-Ensemble: Ensembling CLIP-based Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Julia Dietlmeier, Oluwabukola Grace Adegboro, Vayangi Ganepola, Claudia Mazo, Noel E. O'Connor
Abstract: Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Model predictive quantum control: A modular approach for efficient and robust quantum optimal control
Authors: Eya Guizani, Julian Berberich
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful modern control methods. It relies on repeatedly solving a finite-horizon optimal control problem and applying the beginning piece of the optimal input. In this paper, we develop a modular framework for improving efficiency and robustness of quantum optimal control (QOC) via MPC. We first provide a tutorial introduction to basic concepts of MPC from a QOC perspective. We then present multiple MPC schemes, ranging from simple approaches to more sophisticated schemes which admit stability guarantees. This yields a modular framework which can be used 1) to improve efficiency of open-loop QOC and 2) to improve robustness of closed-loop quantum control by incorporating feedback. We demonstrate these benefits with numerical results, where we benchmark the proposed methods against competing approaches.

Title: Exploring Autoregressive Vision Foundation Models for Image Compression
Authors: Huu-Tai Phung, Yu-Hsiang Lin, Yen-Kuan Ho, Wen-Hsiao Peng
Abstract: This work presents the first attempt to repurpose vision foundation models (VFMs) as image codecs, aiming to explore their generation capability for low-rate image compression. VFMs are widely employed in both conditional and unconditional generation scenarios across diverse downstream tasks, e.g., physical AI applications. Many VFMs employ an encoder-decoder architecture similar to that of end-to-end learned image codecs and learn an autoregressive (AR) model to perform next-token prediction. To enable compression, we repurpose the AR model in VFM for entropy coding the next token based on previously coded tokens. This approach deviates from early semantic compression efforts that rely solely on conditional generation for reconstructing input images. Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted to compare VFM-based codec to current SOTA codecs optimized for distortion or perceptual quality. Notably, certain pre-trained, general-purpose VFMs demonstrate superior perceptual quality at extremely low bitrates compared to specialized learned image codecs. This finding paves the way for a promising research direction that leverages VFMs for low-rate, semantically rich image compression.

Title: Room-acoustic simulations as an alternative to measurements for audio-algorithm evaluation
Authors: Georg Götz, Daniel Gert Nielsen, Steinar Guðjónsson, Finnur Pind
Abstract: Audio-signal-processing and audio-machine-learning (ASP/AML) algorithms are ubiquitous in modern technology like smart devices, wearables, and entertainment systems. Development of such algorithms and models typically involves a formal evaluation to demonstrate their effectiveness and progress beyond the state-of-the-art. Ideally, a thorough evaluation should cover many diverse application scenarios and room-acoustic conditions. However, in practice, evaluation datasets are often limited in size and diversity because they rely on costly and time-consuming measurements. This paper explores how room-acoustic simulations can be used for evaluating ASP/AML algorithms. To this end, we evaluate three ASP/AML algorithms with room-acoustic measurements and data from different simulation engines, and assess the match between the evaluation results obtained from measurements and simulations. The presented investigation compares a numerical wave-based solver with two geometrical acoustics simulators. While numerical wave-based simulations yielded similar evaluation results as measurements for all three evaluated ASP/AML algorithms, geometrical acoustic simulations could not replicate the measured evaluation results as reliably.

Title: Feedback Linearisation with State Constraints
Authors: Songlin Jin, Yuanbo Nie, Morgan Jones
Abstract: Feedback Linearisation (FBL) is a widely used technique that applies feedback laws to transform input-affine nonlinear dynamical systems into linear dynamical systems, allowing for the use of linear controller design methods such as pole placement. However, for problems with state constraints, controlling the linear system induced by FBL can be more challenging than controlling the original system. This is because simple state constraints in the original nonlinear system become complex nonlinear constraints in the FBL induced linearised system, thereby diminishing the advantages of linearisation. To avoid increasing the complexity of state constraints under FBL, this paper introduces a method to first augment system dynamics to capture state constraints before applying FBL. We show that our proposed augmentation method leads to ill-defined relative degrees at state constraint boundaries. However, we show that ill-defined relative degrees can be overcome by using a switching FBL controller. Numerical experiments illustrate the capabilities of this method for handling state constraints within the FBL framework.

Title: MEAN-RIR: Multi-Modal Environment-Aware Network for Robust Room Impulse Response Estimation
Authors: Jiajian Chen, Jiakang Chen, Hang Chen, Qing Wang, Yu Gao, Jun Du
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Modal Environment-Aware Network (MEAN-RIR), which uses an encoder-decoder framework to predict room impulse response (RIR) based on multi-level environmental information from audio, visual, and textual sources. Specifically, reverberant speech capturing room acoustic properties serves as the primary input, which is combined with panoramic images and text descriptions as supplementary inputs. Each input is processed by its respective encoder, and the outputs are fed into cross-attention modules to enable effective interaction between different modalities. The MEAN-RIR decoder generates two distinct components: the first component captures the direct sound and early reflections, while the second produces masks that modulate learnable filtered noise to synthesize the late reverberation. These two components are mixed to reconstruct the final RIR. The results show that MEAN-RIR significantly improves RIR estimation, with notable gains in acoustic parameters.

Title: Generation of realistic cardiac ultrasound sequences with ground truth motion and speckle decorrelation
Authors: Thierry Judge, Nicolas Duchateau, Khuram Faraz, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Olivier Bernard
Abstract: Simulated ultrasound image sequences are key for training and validating machine learning algorithms for left ventricular strain estimation. Several simulation pipelines have been proposed to generate sequences with corresponding ground truth motion, but they suffer from limited realism as they do not consider speckle decorrelation. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an improved simulation framework that explicitly accounts for speckle decorrelation. Our method builds on an existing ultrasound simulation pipeline by incorporating a dynamic model of speckle variation. Starting from real ultrasound sequences and myocardial segmentations, we generate meshes that guide image formation. Instead of applying a fixed ratio of myocardial and background scatterers, we introduce a coherence map that adapts locally over time. This map is derived from correlation values measured directly from the real ultrasound data, ensuring that simulated sequences capture the characteristic temporal changes observed in practice. We evaluated the realism of our approach using ultrasound data from 98 patients in the CAMUS database. Performance was assessed by comparing correlation curves from real and simulated images. The proposed method achieved lower mean absolute error compared to the baseline pipeline, indicating that it more faithfully reproduces the decorrelation behavior seen in clinical data.

Title: Serialized Output Prompting for Large Language Model-based Multi-Talker Speech Recognition
Authors: Hao Shi, Yusuke Fujita, Tomoya Mizumoto, Lianbo Liu, Atsushi Kojima, Yui Sudo
Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP, which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT) fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under both two- and three-talker conditions.

Title: Palladium-Coated Laterally Vibrating Resonators (LVRs) for Hydrogen Sensing
Authors: Gaia Giubilei, Farah Ben Ayed, Yvonne Sautriot, Aurelio Venditti, Kun Zhang, Sila Deniz Calisgan, Pietro Simeoni, Zhenyun Qian, Matteo Rinaldi
Abstract: This work presents a novel hydrogen sensor based on 30% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (ScAlN) laterally vibrating resonators (LVRs) functionalized with a palladium (Pd) thin film. The micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device operates by detecting shifts in resonant frequency resulting from hydrogen absorption in the Pd layer. The sensor demonstrates a high mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 820, an electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt2) of 3.18%, and an enhanced responsivity of 26 Hz/ppm in the low-parts per million (ppm) range, making it highly suitable for hydrogen leak detection. Compared to existing MHz-range technologies, the sensor achieves up to 50x higher sensitivity, while also offering multi-frequency definition in a single lithographic step, minimal footprint, and the highest quality factor among comparable miniaturized platforms.

Title: UAV-Based Intelligent Traffic Surveillance System: Real-Time Vehicle Detection, Classification, Tracking, and Behavioral Analysis
Authors: Ali Khanpour, Tianyi Wang, Afra Vahidi-Shams, Wim Ectors, Farzam Nakhaie, Amirhossein Taheri, Christian Claudel
Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of 90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling, vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics. Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation smart cities.

Title: Ecologically Valid Benchmarking and Adaptive Attention: Scalable Marine Bioacoustic Monitoring
Authors: Nicholas R. Rasmussen, Rodrigue Rizk, Longwei Wang, KC Santosh
Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks. Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.

Title: CPEP: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training Enhances Gesture Generalization on EMG Signals
Authors: Wenhui Cui, Christopher Sandino, Hadi Pouransari, Ran Liu, Juri Minxha, Ellen L. Zippi, Aman Verma, Anna Sedlackova, Behrooz Mahasseni, Erdrin Azemi
Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

Title: Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning with Sub-optimal Policies for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Chengyang Peng, Ekim Yurtsever, Keith A. Redmill
Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from demonstration-based guidance.

Title: A Multiclass Acoustic Dataset and Interactive Tool for Analyzing Drone Signatures in Real-World Environments
Authors: Mia Y. Wang, Mackenzie Linn, Andrew P. Berg, Qian Zhang
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of drones across various industries has introduced significant challenges related to privacy, security, and noise pollution. Current drone detection systems, primarily based on visual and radar technologies, face limitations under certain conditions, highlighting the need for effective acoustic-based detection methods. This paper presents a unique and comprehensive dataset of drone acoustic signatures, encompassing 32 different categories differentiated by brand and model. The dataset includes raw audio recordings, spectrogram plots, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) plots for each drone. Additionally, we introduce an interactive web application that allows users to explore this dataset by selecting specific drone categories, listening to the associated audio, and viewing the corresponding spectrogram and MFCC plots. This tool aims to facilitate research in drone detection, classification, and acoustic analysis, supporting both technological advancements and educational initiatives. The paper details the dataset creation process, the design and implementation of the web application, and provides experimental results and user feedback. Finally, we discuss potential applications and future work to expand and enhance the project.

Title: WildScore: Benchmarking MLLMs in-the-Wild Symbolic Music Reasoning
Authors: Gagan Mundada, Yash Vishe, Amit Namburi, Xin Xu, Zachary Novack, Julian McAuley, Junda Wu
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.

Title: Optimal Damping for the 1D Wave Equation Using a Single Damper
Authors: Petar Mlinarić, Serkan Gugercin, Zoran Tomljanović
Abstract: Vibrational structures are susceptible to catastrophic failures or structural damages when external forces induce resonances or repeated unwanted oscillations. One common mitigation strategy is to use dampers to suppress these disturbances. This leads to the problem of finding optimal damper viscosities and positions for a given vibrational structure. Although extensive research exists for the case of finite-dimensional systems, optimizing damper positions remains challenging due to its discrete nature. To overcome this, we introduce a novel model for the damped wave equation (at the PDE level) with a damper of viscosity $\mathfrak{g}$ at position $\mathfrak{p}$ and develop a system-theoretic input/output-based analysis in the frequency domain. In this system-theoretic formulation, while we consider average displacement as the output, for input (forcing), we analyze two separate cases, namely, the uniform and boundary forcing. For both cases, explicit formulas are derived for the corresponding transfer functions, parametrized by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. This explicit parametrization by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ facilitates analyzing the optimal damping problem (at the PDE level) using norms such as the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norms. We also examine limiting cases, such as when the viscosity is very large or when no external damping is present. To illustrate our approach, we present numerical examples, compare different optimization criteria, and discuss the impact of damping parameters on the damped wave equation.

Title: Quantum Fourier Transform Based Denoising: Unitary Filtering for Enhanced Speech Clarity
Authors: Rajeshwar Tripathi, Sahil Tomar, Sandeep Kumar, Monika Aggarwal
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum-inspired denoising framework that integrates the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) into classical audio enhancement pipelines. Unlike conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods, QFT provides a unitary transformation with global phase coherence and energy preservation, enabling improved discrimination between speech and noise. The proposed approach replaces FFT in Wiener and spectral subtraction filters with a QFT operator, ensuring consistent hyperparameter settings for fair comparison. Experiments on clean speech, synthetic tones, and noisy mixtures across diverse signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions, demonstrate statistically significant gains in SNR, with up to 15 dB improvement and reduced artifact generation. Results confirm that QFT based denoising offers robustness under low SNR and nonstationary noise scenarios without additional computational overhead, highlighting its potential as a scalable pathway toward quantum-enhanced speech processing.

Title: Learning and composing of classical music using restricted Boltzmann machines
Authors: Mutsumi Kobayashi, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: Recently, software has been developed that uses machine learning to mimic the style of a particular composer, such as J. S. Bach. However, since such software often adopts machine learning models with complex structures, it is difficult to analyze how the software understands the characteristics of the composer's music. In this study, we adopted J. S. Bach's music for training of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Since the structure of RBMs is simple, it allows us to investigate the internal states after learning. We found that the learned RBM is able to compose music.

Title: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation via Multiple Foundation Models Mapper
Authors: Gehui Chen, Guan'an Wang, Xiaowen Huang, Jitao Sang
Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming, requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger scale.

Title: MAIA: An Inpainting-Based Approach for Music Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Yuxuan Liu, Peihong Zhang, Rui Sang, Zhixin Li, Shengchen Li
Abstract: Music adversarial attacks have garnered significant interest in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we present Music Adversarial Inpainting Attack (MAIA), a novel adversarial attack framework that supports both white-box and black-box attack scenarios. MAIA begins with an importance analysis to identify critical audio segments, which are then targeted for modification. Utilizing generative inpainting models, these segments are reconstructed with guidance from the output of the attacked model, ensuring subtle and effective adversarial perturbations. We evaluate MAIA on multiple MIR tasks, demonstrating high attack success rates in both white-box and black-box settings while maintaining minimal perceptual distortion. Additionally, subjective listening tests confirm the high audio fidelity of the adversarial samples. Our findings highlight vulnerabilities in current MIR systems and emphasize the need for more robust and secure models.

Title: Training a Perceptual Model for Evaluating Auditory Similarity in Music Adversarial Attack
Authors: Yuxuan Liu, Rui Sang, Peihong Zhang, Zhixin Li, Shengchen Li
Abstract: Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that are often imperceptible to humans, primarily due to a misalignment between model feature spaces and human auditory perception. Existing defenses and perceptual metrics frequently fail to adequately capture these auditory nuances, a limitation supported by our initial listening tests showing low correlation between common metrics and human judgments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Perceptually-Aligned MERT Transformer (PAMT), a novel framework for learning robust, perceptually-aligned music representations. Our core innovation lies in the psychoacoustically-conditioned sequential contrastive transformer, a lightweight projection head built atop a frozen MERT encoder. PAMT achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.65 with subjective scores, outperforming existing perceptual metrics. Our approach also achieves an average of 9.15\% improvement in robust accuracy on challenging MIR tasks, including Cover Song Identification and Music Genre Classification, under diverse perceptual adversarial attacks. This work pioneers architecturally-integrated psychoacoustic conditioning, yielding representations significantly more aligned with human perception and robust against music adversarial attacks.

Title: Exploring Situated Stabilities of a Rhythm Generation System through Variational Cross-Examination
Authors: Błażej Kotowski, Nicholas Evans, Behzad Haki, Frederic Font, Sergi Jordà
Abstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.

Title: Collective decision-making dynamics in hypernetworks
Authors: Angela Fontan, Silun Zhang
Abstract: This work describes a collective decision-making dynamical process in a multiagent system under the assumption of cooperative higher-order interactions within the community, modeled as a hypernetwork. The nonlinear interconnected system is characterized by saturated nonlinearities that describe how agents transmit their opinion state to their neighbors in the hypernetwork, and by a bifurcation parameter representing the community's social effort. We show that the presence of higher-order interactions leads to the unfolding of a pitchfork bifurcation, introducing an interval for the social effort parameter in which the system exhibits bistability. With equilibrium points representing collective decisions, this implies that, depending on the initial conditions, the community will either remain in a deadlock state (with the origin as the equilibrium point) or reach a nontrivial decision. A numerical example is given to illustrate the results.

Title: Robust Model Predictive Control Design for Autonomous Vehicles with Perception-based Observers
Authors: Nariman Niknejad, Gokul S. Sankar, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased, heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Title: Recomposer: Event-roll-guided generative audio editing
Authors: Daniel P. W. Ellis, Eduardo Fonseca, Ron J. Weiss, Kevin Wilson, Scott Wisdom, Hakan Erdogan, John R. Hershey, Aren Jansen, R. Channing Moore, Manoj Plakal
Abstract: Editing complex real-world sound scenes is difficult because individual sound sources overlap in time. Generative models can fill-in missing or corrupted details based on their strong prior understanding of the data domain. We present a system for editing individual sound events within complex scenes able to delete, insert, and enhance individual sound events based on textual edit descriptions (e.g., ``enhance Door'') and a graphical representation of the event timing derived from an ``event roll'' transcription. We present an encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on synthetic (input, desired output) audio example pairs formed by adding isolated sound events to dense, real-world backgrounds. Evaluation reveals the importance of each part of the edit descriptions -- action, class, timing. Our work demonstrates ``recomposition'' is an important and practical application.

Title: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Interpretable Cyberattack Detection in AGC Systems
Authors: Jehad Jilan, Niranjana Naveen Nambiar, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Alok Paranjape, Amr Youssef, Deepa Kundur
Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems, considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Title: Stability Analysis for Stochastic Hybrid Inclusions
Authors: Hongye Su, Dandan Zhang
Abstract: Stochastic hybrid inclusions (SHIs) address situations with the stochastic continuous evolution in a stochastic differential inclusions and random jumps in the difference inclusions due to the forced (the state reaching a boundary in the state space) and/or spontaneous (the state vector may occur spontaneously) transitions. An obvious characteristic of SHIs is the non-uniqueness of random solutions, which can be ensured by the mild regularity conditions, as well as nominal robustness. Basic sufficient conditions for stability/recurrence in probability are usually expressed based on different types of Lyapunov functions, including Lagrange/Lyapunov/Lyapunov-Forster functions respectively for Lagrange/Lyapunov/asymptotical stability in probability and Foster/Lagrange-Forster functions for recurrence, (weaker) relaxed Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions including Matrosov-Foster functions and the stochastic invariance principle, as well as Lyapunov-based necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotical stability in probability or recurrence (i.e.,converse theorems), etc. The converse theorems involving smooth Lyapunov functions are guaranteed by the sequential compactness and thus robustness. In addition, the uniformity property and causality are analyzed for the stabilities in probability. Hence, serving as a partial roadmap for the theoretical development of SHIs, also serving as inspiration, we anticipate that many of the open questions, including the prediction problem, the filtering problem and the control problem, will be resolved based on the techniques of SHIs.

Title: Attitude Control of Rigid Bodies: A Survey of Representations, Topological Obstructions, and Stabilization Techniques
Authors: Hongye Su, Dandan Zhang
Abstract: This paper reviews the attitude control problems for rigid-body systems, starting from the attitude representation for rigid body kinematics. Highly redundant rotation matrix defines the attitude orientation globally and uniquely by 9 parameters, which is the most fundamental one, without any singularities; minimum 3-parameter Euler angles or (modified) Rodrigues parameters define the attitude orientation neither globally nor uniquely, but the former exhibits kinematical singularity and Gimbal lock, while the latter two exhibit geometrical singularity; once-redundant axis-angle or unit quaternion globally define the attitude rotation but not uniquely using 4 parameters, but the former is not appropriate to define very small or very large rotations, while the latter shows unwinding phenomenon despite of the reduced computation burden. In addition, we explore the relationships among those attitude representations, including the connections among Gimbal lock, unwinding phenomenon and a nowhere dense set of zero Lebesgue measure. Based on attitude representations, we analyze different attitude control laws, almost global control and global attitude control, nominal and general robustness, as well as the technique tools.

Title: 6G Channel Modeling: Requirement, Measurement, Methodology and Simulator
Authors: Jianhua Zhang, Jiaxin Lin, Pan Tang, Yuxiang Zhang, Huixin Xu, Tianyang Gao, Haiyang Miao, Huiwen Gong, Changsheng Zhao, Yameng Liu, Yichen Cai, Zhiqiang Yuan, Lei Tian, Shaoshi Yang, Liang Xia, Guangyi Liu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICTs). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To achieve this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for six promising technologies enabling 6G, including ISAC, extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), mid-band and terahertz (THz) technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). A survey of the progress in 6G channel research regarding the above six promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. To support testing, optimization and evaluation, existing 6G channel simulators are summarized. Then, BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030 is introduced as an example of a simulator that was developed on the basis of the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. We also address open issues covering standardization activities, AI-enabled methods, and system performance analysis in the context of 6G channel research. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.

Title: RIS-Enabled NLoS Near-Field Joint Position and Velocity Estimation under User Mobility
Authors: Moustafa Rahal, Benoit Denis, Musa Furkan Keskin, Bernard Uguen, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: In the context of single-base station (BS) non-line-of-sight (NLoS) single-epoch localization with the aid of a reflective reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), this paper introduces a novel three-step algorithm that jointly estimates the position and velocity of a mobile user equipment (UE), while compensating for the Doppler effects observed in near-field (NF) at the RIS elements over the short transmission duration of a sequence of downlink (DL) pilot symbols. First, a low-complexity initialization procedure is proposed, relying in part on far-field (FF) approximation and a static user assumption. Then, an alternating optimization procedure is designed to iteratively refine the velocity and position estimates, as well as the channel gain. The refinement routines leverage small angle approximations and the linearization of the RIS response, accounting for both NF and mobility effects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through extensive simulations under diverse operating conditions with regard to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), UE mobility, uncontrolled multipath and RIS-UE distance. Our results reveal remarkable performance improvements over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) mobility-agnostic benchmark algorithm, while indicating convergence of the proposed algorithm to respective theoretical bounds on position and velocity estimation.

Title: Modelling Micro-Doppler Signature of Drone Propellers in Distributed ISAC
Authors: Heraldo Cesar Alves Costa, Saw James Myint, Carsten Andrich, Sebastian W. Giehl, Christian Schneider, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) comprises detection and analysis of non-cooperative targets by exploiting the resources of the mobile radio system. In this context, micro-Doppler is of great importance for target classification, in order to distinguish objects with local movements. For developing algorithms for target classification, it is necessary to have a large amount of target signatures. Aiming to generate these data, this paper proposes a mathematical model for the micro-Doppler of drone rotating propellers, and validate the proposed model by comparing it to measured micro-Doppler. Results show that the proposed mathematical model can generate micro-Doppler data very similar to those from measurement data.

Title: Automatic segmentation of Organs at Risk in Head and Neck cancer patients from CT and MRI scans
Authors: Sébastien Quetin, Andrew Heschl, Mauricio Murillo, Rohit Murali, Piotr Pater, George Shenouda, Shirin A. Enger, Farhad Maleki
Abstract: Purpose: To present a high-performing, robust, and flexible deep learning pipeline for automatic segmentation of 30 organs-at-risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer patients, using MRI, CT, or both. Method: We trained a segmentation pipeline on paired CT and MRI-T1 scans from 296 patients. We combined data from the H&N OARs CT and MR segmentation (HaN-Seg) challenge and the Burdenko and GLIS-RT datasets from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). MRI was rigidly registered to CT, and both were stacked as input to an nnU-Net pipeline. Left and right OARs were merged into single classes during training and separated at inference time based on anatomical position. Modality Dropout was applied during the training, ensuring the model would learn from both modalities and robustly handle missing modalities during inference. The trained model was evaluated on the HaN-Seg test set and three TCIA datasets. Predictions were also compared with Limbus AI software. Dice Score (DS) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The pipeline achieved state-of-the-art performance on the HaN-Seg challenge with a mean DS of 78.12% and HD of 3.42 mm. On TCIA datasets, the model maintained strong agreement with Limbus AI software (DS: 77.43% , HD: 3.27 mm), while also flagging low-quality contours. The pipeline can segment seamlessly from the CT, the MRI scan, or both. Conclusion: The proposed pipeline achieved the best DS and HD scores among all HaN-Seg challenge participants and establishes a new state-of-the-art for fully automated, multi-modal segmentation of H&N OARs.

Title: Vision Transformer Accelerator ASIC for Real-Time Low-Power Sleep Staging
Authors: Tristan Robitaille, Xilin Liu
Abstract: This paper presents SleepViT, a custom accelerator ASIC for real-time, low-power sleep stage classification in wearable devices. At the core of SleepViT is a lightweight vision transformer model specifically optimized for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based sleep stage classification. The model is trained on the MASS SS3 dataset and achieves a classification accuracy of 82.9% across four sleep stages, while requiring only 31.6k weights-demonstrating its suitability for embedded inference. The proposed transformer is designed and synthesized in 65nm CMOS technology. To minimize power and area, the architecture adopts a novel layer-dependent fixed-point quantization scheme, variable data widths, and optimized memory access patterns. The synthesized accelerator occupies 0.754mm2 of silicon, operates at a maximum clock frequency of 379MHz, and consumes 6.54mW dynamic and 11.0mW leakage power over a 45.6ms inference window. With aggressive power gating during idle periods, the effective average power is 0.56mW, enabling extended battery life in wearable devices. This work highlights the feasibility of deploying transformer-based models in highly constrained edge environments and provides a pathway for future biomedical ASICs that require both real-time performance and ultra-low power consumption.

Title: A Meta-Fusion Architecture for Few-Shot Classification of Spike Waveforms in High-Bandwidth Brain-Machine Interfacing
Authors: Tao Fang, Majid Zamani
Abstract: There is a need for fast adaptation in spike sorting algorithms to implement brain-machine interface (BMIs) in different applications. Learning and adapting the functionality of the sorting process in real-time can significantly improve the performance. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) depend on large amounts of data for training models and their performance sustainability decreases when data is limited. Inspired by meta-learning, this paper proposes a few-shot spike sorting (FS-SS) framework with variable network model size that requires minimal learning training and supervision. The framework is not only compatible with few-shot adaptations, but also it uses attention mechanism and dilated convolutional neural networks. This allows scaling the network parameters to learn the important features of spike signals and to quickly generalize the learning ability to new spike waveforms in recording channels after few observations. The FS-SS was evaluated by using freely accessible datasets, also compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method is 99.28%, which shows extreme robustness to background noise and similarity of the spike waveforms. When the number of training samples is reduced by 90%, the parameter scale is reduced by 68.2%, while the accuracy only decreased by 0.55%. The paper also visualizes the model's attention distribution under spike sorting tasks of different difficulty levels. The attention distribution results show that the proposed model has clear interpretability and high robustness.

Title: Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference
Authors: Robert Lefringhausen, Sami Leon Noel Aziz Hanna, Elias August, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.

Title: Graph Transformer-Based Flood Susceptibility Mapping: Application to the French Riviera and Railway Infrastructure Under Climate Change
Authors: Sreenath Vemula, Filippo Gatti, Pierre Jehel
Abstract: Increasing flood frequency and severity due to climate change threatens infrastructure and demands improved susceptibility mapping techniques. While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.

Title: NISE-PE Constraint: Data-Driven Predictive Control with Persistence of Excitation
Authors: Lucca Heinze Faro, Yuanbo Nie, Paul Trodden
Abstract: Persistence of excitation (PE) is an important requirement for the successful operation of data-driven predictive control, as it ensures that the input-output data contains sufficient information about the underlying system dynamics. Nonetheless, this property is usually assumed rather than guaranteed. This paper introduces a novel data-driven predictive control formulation that maintains PE. The technical development that allows this is the characterisation of the nonexciting input set (NIS), i.e., the set of inputs that lead to loss of PE, and the consequent derivation of a pair of disjoint, linear inequality constraints on the input, termed NIS exclusion PE (NIS-PE) constraint, that, if satisfied, maintain PE. When used in a predictive control formulation, these constraints lead to a mixed-integer optimal control problem with a single binary variable or, equivalently, a pair of disjoint quadratic programming problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved. Numerical examples show how these constraints are able to maintain PE during the controller's operation, resulting in improved performance over conventional approaches for both time-invariant and time-varying systems.

Title: InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Control
Authors: Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tongxin Li
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy widely utilized in domains like energy management, building control, and autonomous systems. However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose InstructMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution (L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, InstructMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using a tailored loss function.

Title: Error-In-Variables Methods for Efficient System Identification with Finite-Sample Guarantees
Authors: Yuyang Zhang, Xinhe Zhang, Jia Liu, Na Li
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning linear dynamical systems from noisy observations. In this setting, existing algorithms either yield biased parameter estimates or have large sample complexities. We resolve these issues by adapting the instrumental variable method and the bias compensation method, originally proposed for error-in-variables models, to our setting. We provide refined non-asymptotic analysis for both methods. Under mild conditions, our algorithms achieve superior sample complexities that match the best-known sample complexity for learning a fully observable system without observation noise.

Title: Secure Multi-Hop Relaying in Large-Scale Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks
Authors: Hyeonsu Lyu, Hyeonho Noh, Hyun Jong Yang, Kaushik Chowdhury
Abstract: As a key enabler of borderless and ubiquitous connectivity, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSINs) are expected to be a cornerstone of 6G wireless communications. However, the multi-tiered and global-scale nature of SAGSINs also amplifies the security vulnerabilities, particularly due to the hidden, passive eavesdroppers distributed throughout the network. In this paper, we introduce a joint optimization framework for multi-hop relaying in SAGSINs that maximizes the minimum user throughput while ensuring a minimum strictly positive secure connection (SPSC) probability. We first derive a closed-form expression for the SPSC probability and incorporate this into a cross-layer optimization framework that jointly optimizes radio resources and relay routes. Specifically, we propose an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ optimal frequency allocation and power splitting strategy-dividing power levels of data transmission and cooperative jamming. We then introduce a Monte-Carlo relay routing algorithm that closely approaches the performance of the numerical upper-bound method. We validate our framework on testbeds built with real-world dataset.

Valdés-Sosa, Amit Majumdar, Alan Evans, Terrence J Sejnowski, Oren Shriki, Sylvain Chevallier, Arnaud Delorme
Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges. First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second, the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128 channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly, predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

Title: Mitigating Hallucinations in LM-Based TTS Models via Distribution Alignment Using GFlowNets
Authors: Chenlin Liu, Minghui Fang, Patrick Zhang, Wei Zhou, Jie Gao, Jiqing Han
Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

Title: Generating Synthetic Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT Images from Non-Contrast Scans Using Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Network
Authors: Pouya Shiri, Xin Yi, Neel P. Mistry, Samaneh Javadinia, Mohammad Chegini, Seok-Bum Ko, Amirali Baniasadi, Scott J. Adams
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing capabilities due to its unimodular pilot this http URL GaBP-based receiver achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

Title: Adaptation of Parameters in Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems
Authors: Hyungbo Shim, Jin Gyu Lee, B. D. O. Anderson
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptation mechanism for heterogeneous multi-agent systems to align the agents' internal parameters, based on enforced consensus through strong couplings. Unlike homogeneous systems, where exact consensus is attainable, the heterogeneity in node dynamics precludes perfect synchronization. Nonetheless, previous work has demonstrated that strong coupling can induce approximate consensus, whereby the agents exhibit emergent collective behavior governed by the so-called blended dynamics. Building on this observation, we introduce an adaptation law that gradually aligns the internal parameters of agents without requiring direct parameter communication. The proposed method reuses the same coupling signal employed for state synchronization, which may result in a biologically or sociologically plausible adaptation process. Under a persistent excitation condition, we prove that the linearly parametrized vector fields of the agents converge to each other, thereby making the dynamics asymptotically homogeneous, and leading to exact consensus of the state variables.

Title: MitoDetect++: A Domain-Robust Pipeline for Mitosis Detection and Atypical Subtyping
Authors: Esha Sadia Nasir, Jiaqi Lv, Mostafa Jahanifar, Shan E Ahmed Raza
Abstract: Automated detection and classification of mitotic figures especially distinguishing atypical from normal remain critical challenges in computational pathology. We present MitoDetect++, a unified deep learning pipeline designed for the MIDOG 2025 challenge, addressing both mitosis detection and atypical mitosis classification. For detection (Track 1), we employ a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with EfficientNetV2-L as the backbone, enhanced with attention modules, and trained via combined segmentation losses. For classification (Track 2), we leverage the Virchow2 vision transformer, fine-tuned efficiently using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize resource consumption. To improve generalization and mitigate domain shifts, we integrate strong augmentations, focal loss, and group-aware stratified 5-fold cross-validation. At inference, we deploy test-time augmentation (TTA) to boost robustness. Our method achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.892 across validation domains, highlighting its clinical applicability and scalability across tasks.

Title: Adaptive Learning Strategies for Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG2025 Challenge
Authors: Biwen Meng, Xi Long, Jingxin Liu
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2 for the MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge: (1) LoRA + UNI2, (2) VPT + UNI2 + Vahadane Normalizer, and (3) VPT + UNI2 + GRL + Stain TTA. We observed that the integration of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) with stain normalization techniques contributed to improved generalization. The best robustness was achieved by further incorporating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko stain normalization. Our final submission achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results suggest that prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers a promising strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging conditions.

Title: Sensing environmental physical interaction to traverse cluttered obstacles
Authors: Yaqing Wang, Ling Xu, Chen Li
Abstract: The long-standing, dominant approach to robotic obstacle negotiation relies on mapping environmental geometry to avoid obstacles. However, this approach does not allow for traversal of cluttered obstacles, hindering applications such as search and rescue operations through earthquake rubble and exploration across lunar and Martian rocks. To overcome this challenge, robots must further sense and utilize environmental physical interactions to control themselves to traverse obstacles. Recently, a physics-based approach has been established towards this vision. Self-propelled robots interacting with obstacles results in a potential energy landscape. On this landscape, to traverse obstacles, a robot must escape from certain landscape basins that attract it into failure modes, to reach other basins that lead to successful modes. Thus, sensing the potential energy landscape is crucial. Here, we developed new methods and performed systematic experiments to demonstrate that the potential energy landscape can be estimated by sensing environmental physical interaction. We developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing obstacle contact forces and torques for systematic experiments over a wide range of parameter space. Surprisingly, although these forces and torques are not fully conservative, they match the potential energy landscape gradients that are conservative forces and torques, enabling an accurate estimation of the potential energy landscape. Additionally, a bio-inspired strategy further enhanced estimation accuracy. Our results provided a foundation for further refining these methods for use in free-locomoting robots. Our study is a key step in establishing a new physics-based approach for robots to traverse clustered obstacles to advance their mobility in complex, real-world environments.

Title: HDN: Hybrid Deep-Learning and Non-Line-of-Sight Reconstruction Framework for Transcranial Photoacoustic Imaging of Human Brain
Authors: Pengcheng Wan, Fan Zhang, Yuting Shen, Hulin Zhao, Xiran Cai, Xiaohua Feng, Fei Gao
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the deep penetration depth of ultrasonic imaging, showing great potential in cerebrovascular disease detection. However, the ultrasonic wave suffers strong attenuation and multi-scattering when it passes through the skull tissue, resulting in the distortion of the collected photoacoustic signal. In this paper, inspired by the principles of deep learning and non-line-of-sight imaging, we propose an image reconstruction framework named HDN (Hybrid Deep-learning and Non-line-of-sight), which consists of the signal extraction part and difference utilization part. The signal extraction part is used to correct the distorted signal and reconstruct an initial image. The difference utilization part is used to make further use of the signal difference between the distorted signal and corrected signal, reconstructing the residual image between the initial image and the target image. The test results on a photoacoustic digital brain simulation dataset show that compared with the traditional method (delay-and-sum) and deep-learning-based method (UNet), the HDN achieved superior performance in both signal correction and image reconstruction. Specifically for the structural similarity index, the HDN reached 0.661 in imaging results, compared to 0.157 for the delay-and-sum method and 0.305 for the deep-learning-based method.

Title: Towards Generative Ray Path Sampling for Faster Point-to-Point Ray Tracing
Authors: Jérome Eertmans, Nicola Di Cicco, Claude Oestges, Laurent Jacques, Enrico M. Vitucci, Vittorio Degli-Esposti
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.

Title: Harpocrates: A Statically Typed Privacy Conscious Pro-gramming Framework
Authors: Sinan Pehlivanoglu, Malte Schwarzkopf
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Harpocrates, a compiler plugin and a framework pair for Scala that binds the privacy policies to the data during data creation in form of oblivious membranes. Harpocrates eliminates raw data for a policy protected type from the application, ensuring it can only exist in protected form and centralizes the policy checking to the policy declaration site, making the privacy logic easy to maintain and verify. Instead of approaching privacy from an information flow verification perspective, Harpocrates allow the data to flow freely throughout the application, inside the policy membranes but enforces the policies when the data is tried to be accessed, mutated, declassified or passed through the application boundary. The centralization of the policies allow the maintainers to change the enforced logic simply by updating a single function while keeping the rest of the application oblivious to the change. Especially in a setting where the data definition is shared by multiple applications, the publisher can update the policies without requiring the dependent applications to make any changes beyond updating the dependency version.

Title: Teleoperation of Continuum Instruments: Task-Priority Analysis of Linear Angular Command Interplay
Authors: Ehsan Nasiri, Long Wang
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of teleoperating continuum instruments for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion (RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator. Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard surgical kit.

Title: A Deep Learning Framework for Two-Dimensional, Multi-Frequency Propagation Factor Estimation
Authors: Sarah E. Wessinger, Leslie N. Smith, Jacob Gull, Jonathan Gehman, Zachary Beever, Andrew J. Kammerer
Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.

Title: MULTI-SCOUT: Multistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications in 5G and Beyond for Moving Target Detection, Positioning, and Tracking
Authors: Yalin E. Sagduyu, Kemal Davaslioglu, Tugba Erpek, Sastry Kompella, Gustave Anderson, Jonathan Ashdown
Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are extracted for every target. For a single target, bistatic delays are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account for receiver clock synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

Title: Deep Feature-specific Imaging
Authors: Yizhou Lu, Andreas Velten
Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.

Title: Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP
Authors: Bingheng Wang, Yichao Gao, Tianchen Sun, Lin Zhao
Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.
