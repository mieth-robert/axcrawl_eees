Title: MRI Image Generation Based on Text Prompts
Authors: Xinxian Fan, Mengye Lyu
Abstract: This study explores the use of text-prompted MRI image generation with the Stable Diffusion (SD) model to address challenges in acquiring real MRI datasets, such as high costs, limited rare case samples, and privacy concerns. The SD model, pre-trained on natural images, was fine-tuned using the 3T fastMRI dataset and the 0.3T M4Raw dataset, with the goal of generating brain T1, T2, and FLAIR images across different magnetic field strengths. The performance of the fine-tuned model was evaluated using quantitative metrics,including Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM), showing improvements in image quality and semantic consistency with the text prompts. To further evaluate the model's potential, a simple classification task was carried out using a small 0.35T MRI dataset, demonstrating that the synthetic images generated by the fine-tuned SD model can effectively augment training datasets and improve the performance of MRI constrast classification tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that text-prompted MRI image generation is feasible and can serve as a useful tool for medical AI applications.

Title: DeepMultiConnectome: Deep Multi-Task Prediction of Structural Connectomes Directly from Diffusion MRI Tractography
Authors: Marcus J. Vroemen, Yuqian Chen, Yui Lo, Tengfei Xu, Weidong Cai, Fan Zhang, Josien P.W. Pluim, Lauren J. O'Donnell
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Title: Temporal Convolutional Autoencoder for Interference Mitigation in FMCW Radar Altimeters
Authors: Charles E. Thornton, Jamie Sloop, Samuel Brown, Aaron Orndorff, William C. Headley, Stephen Young
Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a convolutional autoencoder-based interference mitigation approach for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar altimeters. Specifically, we show that a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) autoencoder effectively exploits temporal correlations in the received signal, providing superior interference suppression compared to a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filter. Unlike existing approaches, the present method operates directly on the received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to arbitrary interference conditions.

Title: Learning-Based Robust Fixed-Time Terminal Sliding Mode Control
Authors: Chaimae El Mortajinea, Moussa Labbadib, Adnane Saoudc, Mostafa Bouzia
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and analyze an integral fixed-time sliding mode control method for a scenario in which the system model is only partially known, utilizing Gaussian processes. We present two theorems on fixed-time convergence. The first theorem addresses the fully known system model, while the second considers situations where the system's drift is approximated utilizing Gaussian processes (GP) for approximating unknown dynamics. Both theorems establish the global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system. The stability analysis is based on a straightforward quadratic Lyapunov function. Our proposed method outperforms an established adaptive fixed-time sliding mode control approach, especially when ample training data is available.

Title: Flexure-FET-Based Receiver with Competitive Binding for Interference Mitigation in Molecular Communication
Authors: Dilara Aktas, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC), a biologically inspired technology, enables applications in nanonetworks and the Internet of Everything (IoE), with great potential for intra-body systems such as drug delivery, health monitoring, and disease detection. This paper extends our prior work on the Flexure-FET MC receiver by integrating a competitive binding model to enhance performance in high-interference environments, where multiple molecular species coexist in the reception space. Previous studies have largely focused on ligand concentration estimation and detection, without fully addressing the effects of inter-species competition for receptor binding. Our proposed framework captures this competition, offering a more biologically accurate model for multitarget environments. By incorporating competition dynamics, the model improves understanding of MC behavior under interference. This approach enables fine-tuning of receptor responses by adjusting ligand concentrations and receptor affinities, thereby optimizing the performance of the Flexure-FET MC receiver. Comprehensive analysis shows that accounting for competitive binding is crucial for improving reliability and accuracy in complex MC systems. Factors such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), symbol error probability (SEP), interferer concentration, and receptor dynamics are shown to significantly affect performance. The proposed framework highlights the need to manage these factors effectively. Results demonstrate that modeling interference through competitive binding offers a realistic system perspective and allows tuning of receiver response, enabling robust detection in environments with multiple coexisting species.

Title: NGPU-LM: GPU-Accelerated N-Gram Language Model for Context-Biasing in Greedy ASR Decoding
Authors: Vladimir Bataev, Andrei Andrusenko, Lilit Grigoryan, Aleksandr Laptev, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers, attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

Title: Local Stability and Region of Attraction Analysis for Neural Network Feedback Systems under Positivity Constraints
Authors: Hamidreza Montazeri Hedesh, Moh Kamalul Wafi, Milad Siami
Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i) a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and (ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability. Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.

Title: Plug-and-Play Posterior Sampling for Blind Inverse Problems
Authors: Anqi Li, Weijie Gan, Ulugbek S. Kamilov
Abstract: We introduce Blind Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models (Blind-PnPDM) as a novel framework for solving blind inverse problems where both the target image and the measurement operator are unknown. Unlike conventional methods that rely on explicit priors or separate parameter estimation, our approach performs posterior sampling by recasting the problem into an alternating Gaussian denoising scheme. We leverage two diffusion models as learned priors: one to capture the distribution of the target image and another to characterize the parameters of the measurement operator. This PnP integration of diffusion models ensures flexibility and ease of adaptation. Our experiments on blind image deblurring show that Blind-PnPDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. Our results highlight the effectiveness of treating blind inverse problems as a sequence of denoising subproblems while harnessing the expressive power of diffusion-based priors.

Title: LLM-Synth4KWS: Scalable Automatic Generation and Synthesis of Confusable Data for Custom Keyword Spotting
Authors: Pai Zhu, Quan Wang, Dhruuv Agarwal, Kurt Partridge
Abstract: Custom keyword spotting (KWS) allows detecting user-defined spoken keywords from streaming audio. This is achieved by comparing the embeddings from voice enrollments and input audio. State-of-the-art custom KWS models are typically trained contrastively using utterances whose keywords are randomly sampled from training dataset. These KWS models often struggle with confusing keywords, such as "blue" versus "glue". This paper introduces an effective way to augment the training with confusable utterances where keywords are generated and grouped from large language models (LLMs), and speech signals are synthesized with diverse speaking styles from text-to-speech (TTS) engines. To better measure user experience on confusable KWS, we define a new northstar metric using the average area under DET curve from confusable groups (c-AUC). Featuring high scalability and zero labor cost, the proposed method improves AUC by 3.7% and c-AUC by 11.3% on the Speech Commands testing set.

Title: Sensitivity of DC Network Representation for GIC Analysis
Authors: Aniruddh Mishra, Arthur K. Barnes, Jose E. Tabarez, Adam Mate
Abstract: Geomagnetic disturbances are a threat to the reliability and security of our national critical energy infrastructures. These events specifically result in geomagnetically induced currents, which can cause damage to transformers due to magnetic saturation. In order to mitigate these effects, blocker devices must be placed in optimal locations. Finding this placement requires a dc representation of the ac transmission lines, which this paper discusses. Different decisions in this process, including the method of representing the blocking devices, result in significant variations to the power loss calculations. To analyze these effects, we conclude the paper by comparing the losses on a sample network with different modeling implementations.

Title: Detecting Switching Attacks On Traffic Flow Regulation For Changing Driving Patterns
Authors: Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy
Abstract: Modern traffic management systems increasingly adopt hierarchical control strategies for improved efficiency and scalability, where a local traffic controller mode is chosen by a supervisory controller based on the changing large-scale driving patterns. Unfortunately, such local metering controllers are also vulnerable to cyberattacks that can disrupt the controller switching, leading to undesired, inefficient, and even unsafe traffic operations. Additionally, the detection of such attacks becomes challenging when the operational mode of the traffic is uncertain and the operational mode identification is delayed. Thus, in this work, we propose a cyberattack detection scheme to detect the compromised controller switching in ramp metering for an uncertain, multimodal macroscopic traffic operation of a freeway segment. In particular, we propose a bank of detectors corresponding to each admissible traffic mode that can compensate for the uncertain traffic mode of the freeway. Furthermore, we utilize backstepping tools along with Lyapunov function theory to achieve analytical performance guarantees for the detector, such as nominal exponential stability, anomaly/uncertainty-to-residual stability, robustness, and sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed detection scheme through simulations of free traffic under realistic traffic parameters, uncertainties, and commonly occurring attack scenarios.

Title: Bi-Residual Neural Network based Synchronous Motor Electrical Faults Diagnosis: Intra-link Layer Design for High-frequency Features
Authors: Qianchao Wang, Leena Heistrene, Yoash Levron, Yuxuan Ding, Yaping Du
Abstract: In practical resource-constrained environments, efficiently extracting the potential high-frequency fault-critical information is an inherent problem. To overcome this problem, this work suggests leveraging a bi-residual neural network named Bi-ResNet to extract the inner spatial-temporal high-frequency features using embedded spatial-temporal convolution blocks and intra-link layers. It can be considered as embedding a high-frequency extractor into networks without adding any parameters, helping shallow networks achieve the performance of deep networks. In our experiments, five advanced CNN-based neural networks and two baselines across a real-life dataset are utilized for synchronous motor electrical fault diagnosis to demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-ResNet including one analytical, comparative, and ablation experiments. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The Bi-ResNet can perform better on low-resolution noisy data. 2) The proposed intra-links can help high-frequency components extraction and location from raw data. 3) There is a trade-off between intra-link number and input data complexity.

Title: Voltage Control of the Boost Converter: PI vs. Nonlinear Passivity-based Control
Authors: Leyan Fang, Romeo Ortega, Robert Griñó
Abstract: We carry-out a detailed analysis of direct voltage control of a Boost converter feeding a simple resistive load. First, we prove that using a classical PI control to stabilize a desired equilibrium leads to a very complicated dynamic behavior consisting of two equilibrium points, one of them always unstable for all PI gains and circuit parameter values. Interestingly, the second equilibrium point may be rendered stable -- but for all tuning gains leading to an extremely large value of the circuit current and the controller integrator state. Moreover, if we neglect the resistive effect of the inductor, there is only one equilibrium and it is always unstable. From a practical point of view, it is important to note that the only useful equilibrium point is that of minimum current and that, in addition, there is always a resistive component in the inductor either by its parasitic resistance or by the resistive component of the output impedance of the previous stage. In opposition to this troublesome scenario we recall three nonlinear voltage-feedback controllers, that ensure asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium with simple gain tuning rules, an easily defined domain of attraction and smooth transient behavior. Two of them are very simple, nonlinear, static voltage feedback rules, while the third one is a variation of the PID scheme called PID-Passivity-based Control (PBC). In its original formulation PID-PBC requires full state measurement, but we present a modified version that incorporates a current observer. All three nonlinear controllers are designed following the principles of PBC, which has had enormous success in many engineering applications.

Title: Interturn Fault Detection in IPMSMs: Two Adaptive Observer-based Solutions
Authors: Romeo Ortega, Alexey Bobtsov, Leyan Fang, Oscar Texis-Loaiza, Johannes Schiffer
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of online detection of inter-turn short-circuit faults (ITSCFs) that occur in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). We propose two solutions to this problem: (i) a very simple linear observer and (ii) a generalized parameter estimation based observer, that incorporates a high performance estimator -- with both observers detecting the short-circuit current and the fault intensity. Although the first solution guarantees the detection of the fault exponentially fast, the rate of convergence is fully determined by the motor parameters that, in some cases, may be too slow. The second observer, on the other hand, ensures finite convergence time under the weakest assumption of interval excitation. To make the observers adaptive, we develop a parameter estimator that, in the case of isotropic PMSMs, estimates on-line (exponentially fast) the resistance and inductance of the motor. It should be underscored that, in contrast with existing observers (including the widely popular Kalman filter) that provide indirect information of the fault current, our observers provide explicit one -- namely the amplitude of the fault current. The performance of both observers, in their linear and generalized parameter estimation-based versions, is illustrated with realistic simulation studies.

Title: System Identification for Virtual Sensor-Based Model Predictive Control: Application to a 2-DoF Direct-Drive Robotic Arm
Authors: Kosei Tsuji, Ichiro Maruta, Kenji Fujimoto, Tomoyuki Maeda, Yoshihisa Tamase, Tsukasa Shinohara
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) offers a powerful approach for controlling complex nonlinear systems, yet faces two key challenges. First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations.

Title: Joint Phase Shift Optimization and Precoder Selection for RIS-Assisted 5G NR MIMO Systems
Authors: Osman Mert Yilmaz, Tayfun Yilmaz, Ali Gorcin, Ibrahim Hokelek, Ertugrul Guvenkaya, Haci Ilhan
Abstract: By intelligently reconfiguring wireless propagation environment, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can enhance signal quality, suppress interference, and improve channel conditions, thereby serving as a powerful complement to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures. However, jointly optimizing the RIS phase shifts and the MIMO transmit precoder in 5G and beyond networks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a singular value ($\lambda$)-based RIS optimization strategy, where the phase shifts are configured to maximize the dominant singular values of the cascaded channel matrix, and the corresponding singular vectors are utilized for MIMO transmit precoding. The proposed precoder selection does not require mutual information computation across subbands, thereby reducing time complexity. To solve the $\lambda$-based optimization problem, maximum cross-swapping algorithm (MCA) is applied while an effective rank-based method is utilized for benchmarking purposes. The simulation results show that the proposed precoder selection method consistently outperforms the conventional approach under $\lambda$-based RIS optimization.

Title: Topological Adaptive Least Mean Squares Algorithms over Simplicial Complexes
Authors: Lorenzo Marinucci, Claudio Battiloro, Paolo Di Lorenzo
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS) methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory, we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions, steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g., the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order topological features.

Title: Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for Wi-Fi Systems With Temporal Correlation
Authors: Junyong Shin, Eunsung Jeon, Inhyoung Kim, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: To achieve higher throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi systems, a station (STA) needs to efficiently compress channel state information (CSI) and feed it back to an access point (AP). In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback framework tailored for next-generation Wi-Fi systems. Our framework incorporates a pair of encoder and decoder neural networks to compress and reconstruct the angle parameters of the CSI. To enable an efficient finite-bit representation of the encoder output, we introduce a trainable vector quantization module, which is integrated after the encoder network and jointly trained with both the encoder and decoder networks in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we further enhance our framework by leveraging the temporal correlation of the angle parameters. Specifically, we propose an angle-difference feedback strategy which transmits the difference between the current and previous angle parameters when the difference is sufficiently small. This strategy accounts for the periodicity of the angle parameters through proper preprocessing and mitigates error propagation effects using novel feedback methods. We also introduce a DL-based CSI refinement module for the AP, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the angle parameters by simultaneously utilizing both the previous and current feedback information. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the standard method employed in current Wi-Fi systems. Our results also demonstrate significant performance gains achieved by the angle-difference feedback strategy and the CSI refinement module.

Title: Latent Representations for Control Design with Provable Stability and Safety Guarantees
Authors: Paul Lutkus, Kaiyuan Wang, Lars Lindemann, Stephen Tu
Abstract: We initiate a formal study on the use of low-dimensional latent representations of dynamical systems for verifiable control synthesis. Our main goal is to enable the application of verification techniques -- such as Lyapunov or barrier functions -- that might otherwise be computationally prohibitive when applied directly to the full state representation. Towards this goal, we first provide dynamics-aware approximate conjugacy conditions which formalize the notion of reconstruction error necessary for systems analysis. We then utilize our conjugacy conditions to transfer the stability and invariance guarantees of a latent certificate function (e.g., a Lyapunov or barrier function) for a latent space controller back to the original system. Importantly, our analysis contains several important implications for learning latent spaces and dynamics, by highlighting the necessary geometric properties which need to be preserved by the latent space, in addition to providing concrete loss functions for dynamics reconstruction that are directly related to control design. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of our theory to two case studies: (1) stabilization of a cartpole system, and (2) collision avoidance for a two vehicle system.

Title: Interspeech 2025 URGENT Speech Enhancement Challenge
Authors: Kohei Saijo, Wangyou Zhang, Samuele Cornell, Robin Scheibler, Chenda Li, Zhaoheng Ni, Anurag Kumar, Marvin Sach, Yihui Fu, Wei Wang, Tim Fingscheidt, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: There has been a growing effort to develop universal speech enhancement (SE) to handle inputs with various speech distortions and recording conditions. The URGENT Challenge series aims to foster such universal SE by embracing a broad range of distortion types, increasing data diversity, and incorporating extensive evaluation metrics. This work introduces the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge, the second edition of the series, to explore several aspects that have received limited attention so far: language dependency, universality for more distortion types, data scalability, and the effectiveness of using noisy training data. We received 32 submissions, where the best system uses a discriminative model, while most other competitive ones are hybrid methods. Analysis reveals some key findings: (i) some generative or hybrid approaches are preferred in subjective evaluations over the top discriminative model, and (ii) purely generative SE models can exhibit language dependency.

Title: Optimizing Connectivity and Scheduling of Near/Far Field Users in Massive MIMO NOMA System
Authors: Ziad Qais Al-Abbasi
Abstract: It is envisioned that the next generations of wireless communication environment will be characterized with dense traffic demand due to the prediction that there will be large numbers of active users. Hence, it is important to find a solution to deal with such dense numbers of users. This paper investigates optimizing the connectivity and users scheduling to improve the performance of near and far field users in a downlink, multiuser, massive MIMO-NOMA system. For the considered system model, combining NOMA side by side with massive MIMO offers a great opportunity to exploit the available radio resources and boost the overall system efficiency. The paper proposes separate clustering of near field users and far field users. It also proposes using a beamforming scheme to separately serve the users within each cluster. However, NOMA is proposed to be applied among all users to boost resource sharing. In particular, a cognitive-NOMA beamforming scheme and NOMA themed beamforming are proposed to serve the users within each cluster, and they are compared against random beamforming from literature. Simulation results show that both of the proposed beamforming schemes proved their superiority as compared to random beamforming. Several scheduling techniques were also considered in this paper to examine possible solutions for boosting the system performance considered, namely, priority, joint, dynamic, and fairness-based scheduling techniques for both near field and far field users. The paper also proposes a suboptimal, fairness aiming and gradual allocation approach for allocating the transmission power among the users. The results show that user-clustering offers better connectivity and scheduling performance than the case where no clustering is applied.

Title: Spoken question answering for visual queries
Authors: Nimrod Shabtay, Zvi Kons, Avihu Dekel, Hagai Aronowitz, Ron Hoory, Assaf Arbelle
Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA system to accept visual and spoken input respectively. This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken questions on images. Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

Title: CF-DETR: Coarse-to-Fine Transformer for Real-Time Object Detection
Authors: Woojin Shin, Donghwa Kang, Byeongyun Park, Brent Byunghoon Kang, Jinkyu Lee, Hyeongboo Baek
Abstract: Detection Transformers (DETR) are increasingly adopted in autonomous vehicle (AV) perception systems due to their superior accuracy over convolutional networks. However, concurrently executing multiple DETR tasks presents significant challenges in meeting firm real-time deadlines (R1) and high accuracy requirements (R2), particularly for safety-critical objects, while navigating the inherent latency-accuracy trade-off under resource constraints. Existing real-time DNN scheduling approaches often treat models generically, failing to leverage Transformer-specific properties for efficient resource allocation. To address these challenges, we propose CF-DETR, an integrated system featuring a novel coarse-to-fine Transformer architecture and a dedicated real-time scheduling framework NPFP**. CF-DETR employs three key strategies (A1: coarse-to-fine inference, A2: selective fine inference, A3: multi-level batch inference) that exploit Transformer properties to dynamically adjust patch granularity and attention scope based on object criticality, aiming to satisfy R2. The NPFP** scheduling framework (A4) orchestrates these adaptive mechanisms A1-A3. It partitions each DETR task into a safety-critical coarse subtask for guaranteed critical object detection within its deadline (ensuring R1), and an optional fine subtask for enhanced overall accuracy (R2), while managing individual and batched execution. Our extensive evaluations on server, GPU-enabled embedded platforms, and actual AV platforms demonstrate that CF-DETR, under an NPFP** policy, successfully meets strict timing guarantees for critical operations and achieves significantly higher overall and critical object detection accuracy compared to existing baselines across diverse AV workloads.

Title: Synthetic Generation and Latent Projection Denoising of Rim Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis
Authors: Alexandra G. Roberts, Ha M. Luu, Mert Şişman, Alexey V. Dimov, Ceren Tozlu, Ilhami Kovanlikaya, Susan A. Gauthier, Thanh D. Nguyen, Yi Wang
Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner. We release our code and generated data at this https URL upon publication.

Title: Vision-Integrated High-Quality Neural Speech Coding
Authors: Yao Guo, Yang Ai, Rui-Chen Zheng, Hui-Peng Du, Xiao-Hang Jiang, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel vision-integrated neural speech codec (VNSC), which aims to enhance speech coding quality by leveraging visual modality information. In VNSC, the image analysis-synthesis module extracts visual features from lip images, while the feature fusion module facilitates interaction between the image analysis-synthesis module and the speech coding module, transmitting visual information to assist the speech coding process. Depending on whether visual information is available during the inference stage, the feature fusion module integrates visual features into the speech coding module using either explicit integration or implicit distillation strategies. Experimental results confirm that integrating visual information effectively improves the quality of the decoded speech and enhances the noise robustness of the neural speech codec, without increasing the bitrate.

Title: Self-supervised feature learning for cardiac Cine MR image reconstruction
Authors: Siying Xu, Marcel Früh, Kerstin Hammernik, Andreas Lingg, Jens Kübler, Patrick Krumm, Daniel Rueckert, Sergios Gatidis, Thomas Küstner
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised feature learning assisted reconstruction (SSFL-Recon) framework for MRI reconstruction to address the limitation of existing supervised learning methods. Although recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance in MRI reconstruction, most require fully-sampled images for supervised learning, which is challenging in practice considering long acquisition times under respiratory or organ motion. Moreover, nearly all fully-sampled datasets are obtained from conventional reconstruction of mildly accelerated datasets, thus potentially biasing the achievable performance. The numerous undersampled datasets with different accelerations in clinical practice, hence, remain underutilized. To address these issues, we first train a self-supervised feature extractor on undersampled images to learn sampling-insensitive features. The pre-learned features are subsequently embedded in the self-supervised reconstruction network to assist in removing artifacts. Experiments were conducted retrospectively on an in-house 2D cardiac Cine dataset, including 91 cardiovascular patients and 38 healthy subjects. The results demonstrate that the proposed SSFL-Recon framework outperforms existing self-supervised MRI reconstruction methods and even exhibits comparable or better performance to supervised learning up to $16\times$ retrospective undersampling. The feature learning strategy can effectively extract global representations, which have proven beneficial in removing artifacts and increasing generalization ability during reconstruction.

Title: Evaluation of Voltage Unbalance Metrics in Distribution Networks with High DER Penetration
Authors: Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez
Abstract: Voltage unbalance, caused by variations in voltage magnitude and phase angle, is a significant power quality issue in three-phase systems, leading to equipment inefficiencies and increased system losses. The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the grid adds complexity, as DER can either reduce or worsen voltage unbalance, depending on factors such as grid configuration and the distribution of loads and DER themselves. This study explores the effects of DER penetration on voltage unbalance levels and the accuracy of the different indices most commonly used to quantify this unbalance. The results highlight the varying impacts of DER on unbalance and index performance, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to assess voltage unbalance in modern distribution systems.

Title: LCB-CV-UNet: Enhanced Detector for High Dynamic Range Radar Signals
Authors: Yanbin Wang, Xingyu Chen, Yumiao Wang, Xiang Wang, Chuanfei Zang, Guolong Cui, Jiahuan Liu
Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High Dynamic Range (HDR) radar signals. Initially, a hardware-efficient, plug-and-play module named Logarithmic Connect Block (LCB) is proposed as a phase coherence preserving solution to address the inherent challenges in handling HDR features. Then, we propose the Dual Hybrid Dataset Construction method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset, approximating typical HDR signal scenarios with adjustable target distributions. Simulation results show about 1% total detection probability improvement with under 0.9% computational complexity added compared with the baseline. Furthermore, it excels 5% over the baseline at the range in 11-13 dB signal-to-noise ratio typical for urban targets. Finally, the real experiment validates the practicality of our model.

Title: DeepFilterGAN: A Full-band Real-time Speech Enhancement System with GAN-based Stochastic Regeneration
Authors: Sanberk Serbest, Tijana Stojkovic, Milos Cernak, Andrew Harper
Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further improvements.

Title: Robust Aperiodic Sampled-Data Washout Control for Uncertain Affine Systems
Authors: Folco Giorgetti, Francesco Crocetti, Mario Luca Fravolini, Francesco Ferrante
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of designing an aperiodic sampled-data controller stabilizing the zero-input equilibrium of an uncertain affine plant. The closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system incorporating a timer triggering the occurrence of the sampling events and two memory states storing the value of the controller state and controller output at each sampling time. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the controller parameters are given to establish the sought property. A constructive controller design algorithm based on sum-of-squares programming is given. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: Integrated design of system structure and delayed resonator towards efficient non-collocated vibration absorption
Authors: Adam Peichl, Matěj Kuře, Wim Michiels, Tomáš Vyhlídal
Abstract: The problem of non-collocated vibration absorption by a delayed resonator is addressed with emphasis on system fatigue resistance and energy efficiency of control actions. The analysis is performed for a system consisting of an arbitrary large series of flexibly linked single-degree-of-freedom masses. For the stage where the vibration of the target mass is fully absorbed by the non-collocated resonator, key forces, motion amplitudes and potential energies across the system structure are assessed. Next, a complete parameter set of the resonator gain and delay is derived, and the actuation force and power needed by the resonator for the full vibration absorption is determined. The derived quantities are utilized in forming an optimization problem to balance minimal risk of fatigue across the system structure and power needed by the resonator, under the closed loop stability and parameter constraints. Next to the gain and delay of the resonator, selected structural parameters of the system are used as variables in the constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Experimental and numerical case studies are included to demonstrate benefits of the proposed integrated structural and control design.

Title: Decoupling Periodic Systems: An Algebraic Approach
Authors: Vladimír Kučera
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of row-by-row (or diagonal) decoupling of discrete-time linear multi-input multi-output systems with periodic time-varying coefficients using periodic state feedback. Previous solutions have tackled row-by-row decoupling using dynamic compensation for square systems and block-decoupling through regular state feedback for nonsquare systems with more outputs than inputs. While it appears likely that a row-by-row state feedback solution for square systems can be deduced from these findings, a direct argument seems more appropriate here as it presents a natural extension for decoupling nonsquare systems with more inputs than outputs. This extension, which necessitates nonregular state feedback, has yet to be explored for periodic systems. Our approach is purely algebraic, based on a time-invariant representation of the periodic system.

Title: Low-Complexity Transform Adjustments For Video Coding
Authors: Amir Said, Hilmi E. Egilmez, Yung-Hsuan Chao
Abstract: Recent video codecs with multiple separable transforms can achieve significant coding gains using asymmetric trigonometric transforms (DCTs and DSTs), because they can exploit diverse statistics of residual block signals. However, they add excessive computational and memory complexity on large transforms (32-point and larger), since their practical software and hardware implementations are not as efficient as of the DCT-2. This article introduces a novel technique to design low-complexity approximations of trigonometric transforms. The proposed method uses DCT-2 computations, and applies orthogonal adjustments to approximate the most important basis vectors of the desired transform. Experimental results on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, while providing practically identical coding efficiency.

Title: Dual-Task Graph Neural Network for Joint Seizure Onset Zone Localization and Outcome Prediction using Stereo EEG
Authors: Syeda Abeera Amir, Artur Agaronyan, William Gaillard, Chima Oluigbo, Syed Muhammad Anwar
Abstract: Accurately localizing the brain regions that triggers seizures and predicting whether a patient will be seizure-free after surgery are vital for surgical planning and patient management in drug-resistant epilepsy. Stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) delivers high-fidelity intracranial recordings that enable clinicians to precisely locate epileptogenic networks. However, the clinical identification is subjective and dependent on the expertise of the clinical team. Data driven approaches in this domain are sparse, despite the fact that sEEG offers high temporal-fidelity related to seizure dynamics that can be leveraged using graph structures ideal for imitating brain networks. In this study, we introduce a dual-task graph-neural network (GNN) framework that operates on windowed sEEG recordings to jointly predict seizure-freedom outcomes and identify seizure-onset-zone (SOZ) channels. We assemble non-overlapping 10 second windows from 51 clinical seizures spread across 20 pediatric patients, with sEEG data annotated by clinical experts. For each temporal window we construct a functional connectivity graph via thresholded Pearson correlations and extract rich node features (spectral, statistical, wavelet, Hjorth and local graph features), alongside six global graph descriptors. We optimize a combined cross-entropy loss with a tunable task-weight, and select model hyper-parameters via Optuna. Under window-level 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieves a mean graph-level accuracy of $89.31 \pm 0.0976 \%$ for seizure-freedom prediction and a node-level SOZ localization accuracy of $94.72. \pm 0.0041 \%$. For the best performing model, we ran additive and leave-one-out ablation studies to explore feature importance for graph and node-level accuracy.

Title: Position Dependent Prediction Combination For Intra-Frame Video Coding
Authors: Amir Said, Xin Zhao, Marta Karczewicz, Jianle Chen, Feng Zou
Abstract: Intra-frame prediction in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard can be empirically improved by applying sets of recursive two-dimensional filters to the predicted values. However, this approach does not allow (or complicates significantly) the parallel computation of pixel predictions. In this work we analyze why the recursive filters are effective, and use the results to derive sets of non-recursive predictors that have superior performance. We present an extension to HEVC intra prediction that combines values predicted using non-filtered and filtered (smoothed) reference samples, depending on the prediction mode, and block size. Simulations using the HEVC common test conditions show that a 2.0% bit rate average reduction can be achieved compared to HEVC, for All Intra (AI) configurations.

Title: StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?
Authors: Iddo Yosha, Gallil Maimon, Yossi Adi
Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks.

Title: Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi
Authors: Viraj Nadkarni, Pramod Viswanath
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.

Title: PdNeuRAM: Forming-Free, Multi-Bit Pd/HfO2 ReRAM for Energy-Efficient Computing

Abstract: Memristor technology shows great promise for energy-efficient computing, yet it grapples with challenges like resistance drift and inherent variability. For filamentary Resistive RAM (ReRAM), one of the most investigated types of memristive devices, the expensive electroforming step required to create conductive pathways results in increased power and area overheads and reduced endurance. In this study, we present novel HfO2-based forming-free ReRAM devices, PdNeuRAM, that operate at low voltages, support multi-bit functionality, and display reduced variability. Through a deep understanding and comprehensive material characterization, we discover the key process that allows this unique behavior: a Pd-O-Hf configuration that capitalizes on Pd innate affinity for integrating into HfO2. This structure actively facilitates charge redistribution at room temperature, effectively eliminating the need for electroforming. Moreover, the fabricated ReRAM device provides tunable resistance states for dense memory and reduces programming and reading energy by 43% and 73%, respectively, using spiking neural networks (SNN). This study reveals novel mechanistic insights and delineates a strategic roadmap for the realization of power-efficient and cost-effective ReRAM devices.

Title: PGLearn -- An Open-Source Learning Toolkit for Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Michael Klamkin, Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.

Title: Spring-Brake! Handed Shearing Auxetics Improve Efficiency of Hopping and Standing
Authors: Joseph Sullivan, Ian Good, Samuel A. Burden, Jeffrey Ian Lipton
Abstract: Energy efficiency is critical to the success of legged robotics. Efficiency is lost through wasted energy during locomotion and standing. Including elastic elements has been shown to reduce movement costs, while including breaks can reduce standing costs. However, adding separate elements for each increases the mass and complexity of a leg, reducing overall system performance. Here we present a novel compliant mechanism using a Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) that acts as a spring and break in a monopod hopping robot. The HSA acts as a parallel elastic actuator, reducing electrical power for dynamic hopping and matching the efficiency of state-of-the-art compliant hoppers. The HSA\u2019s auxetic behavior enables dual functionality. During static tasks, it locks under large forces with minimal input power by blocking deformation, creating high friction similar to a capstan mechanism. This allows the leg to support heavy loads without motor torque, addressing thermal inefficiency. The multi-functional design enhances both dynamic and static performance, offering a versatile solution for robotic applications.

Title: Categorical Lyapunov Theory II: Stability of Systems
Authors: Aaron D. Ames, Sébastien Mattenet, Joe Moeller
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a foundational characterization of stable equilibrium points in dynamical systems. In this paper, we develop a framework for stability for F-coalgebras. We give two definitions for a categorical setting in which we can study the stability of a coalgebra for an endofunctor F. One is minimal and better suited for concrete settings, while the other is more intricate and provides a richer theory. We prove a Lyapunov theorem for both notions of setting for stability, and a converse Lyapunov theorem for the second.

Title: EmergentTTS-Eval: Evaluating TTS Models on Complex Prosodic, Expressiveness, and Linguistic Challenges Using Model-as-a-Judge
Authors: Ruskin Raj Manku, Yuzhi Tang, Xingjian Shi, Mu Li, Alex Smola
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation $\href{this https URL}{code}$ and the $\href{this https URL}{dataset}$.

Title: GeoMan: Temporally Consistent Human Geometry Estimation using Image-to-Video Diffusion
Authors: Gwanghyun Kim, Xueting Li, Ye Yuan, Koki Nagano, Tianye Li, Jan Kautz, Se Young Chun, Umar Iqbal
Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.

Title: Dynamic Estimation Loss Control in Variational Quantum Sensing via Online Conformal Inference
Authors: Ivana Nikoloska, Hamdi Joudeh, Ruud van Sloun, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing on NISQ devices.

Title: Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System
Authors: Simón Martínez-Rozas, David Alejo, José Javier Carpio, Fernando Caballero, Luis Merino
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.

Title: Spoken Language Modeling with Duration-Penalized Self-Supervised Units
Authors: Nicol Visser, Herman Kamper
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored. We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks where they are beneficial.

Title: Spectrotemporal Modulation: Efficient and Interpretable Feature Representation for Classifying Speech, Music, and Environmental Sounds
Authors: Andrew Chang, Yike Li, Iran R. Roman, David Poeppel
Abstract: Audio DNNs have demonstrated impressive performance on various machine listening tasks; however, most of their representations are computationally costly and uninterpretable, leaving room for optimization. Here, we propose a novel approach centered on spectrotemporal modulation (STM) features, a signal processing method that mimics the neurophysiological representation in the human auditory cortex. The classification performance of our STM-based model, without any pretraining, is comparable to that of pretrained audio DNNs across diverse naturalistic speech, music, and environmental sounds, which are essential categories for both human cognition and machine perception. These results show that STM is an efficient and interpretable feature representation for audio classification, advancing the development of machine listening and unlocking exciting new possibilities for basic understanding of speech and auditory sciences, as well as developing audio BCI and cognitive computing.

Title: On the Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient-Tracking with Finite-Time Consensus
Authors: Aaron Fainman, Stefan Vlaski
Abstract: Algorithms for decentralized optimization and learning rely on local optimization steps coupled with combination steps over a graph. Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieve finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm, clarifying the interplay between accuracy and length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.

Title: Weakly-supervised Localization of Manipulated Image Regions Using Multi-resolution Learned Features
Authors: Ziyong Wang, Charith Abhayaratne
Abstract: The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions. Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet), with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on pixel-level labels.

Title: Multilook Coherent Imaging: Theoretical Guarantees and Algorithms
Authors: Xi Chen, Soham Jana, Christopher A. Metzler, Arian Maleki, Shirin Jalali
Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging, providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Distributed Federated Learning for Vehicular Network Security: Anomaly Detection Benefits and Multi-Domain Attack Threats
Authors: Utku Demir, Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek, Hossein Jafari, Sastry Kompella, Mengran Xue
Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale, high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data. Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network. We further show that local training data size and time-varying network connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.

Title: Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform
Authors: Saulo Queiroz
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing the N-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based solely on recursive Rectangular Index Compression (RIC) [1][2] and structured frequency shifts. The RIC DFT algorithm compresses a signal from $N=CL$ to $C\in[2,N/2]$ points at the expense of $N-1$ complex additions and no complex multiplication. It is shown that a $C$-point DFT on the compressed signal corresponds exactly to $C$ DFT coefficients of the original $N$-point DFT, namely, $X_{kL}$, $k=0,1,\ldots,C-1$ with no need for twiddle factors. We rely on this strategy to decompose the DFT by recursively compressing the input signal and applying global frequency shifts (to get odd-indexed DFT coefficients). We show that this new structure can relax the power-of-two assumption of the radix-2 FFT by enabling signal input lengths such as $N=c\cdot 2^k$ (for $k\geq 0$ and a non-power-of-two $c>0$). Thus, our algorithm potentially outperforms radix-2 FFTs for the cases where significant zero-padding is needed. The proposed approach achieves a computational complexity of $O(N \log N)$ and offers a new structural perspective on DFT computation, with potential impacts on several DFT issues like numerical stability, hardware implementation, sparse transforms, convolutions, and others DFT-based procedures.

Title: Maximum Spherical Mean Value (mSMV) Filtering for Whole Brain Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping
Authors: Alexandra G. Roberts, Dominick J. Romano, Mert Şişman, Alexey V. Dimov, Pascal Spincemaille, Thanh D. Nguyen, Ilhami Kovanlikaya, Susan A. Gauthier, Yi Wang
Abstract: To develop a tissue field filtering algorithm, called maximum Spherical Mean Value (mSMV), for reducing shadow artifacts in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain without requiring brain tissue erosion. Residual background field is a major source of shadow artifacts in QSM. The mSMV algorithm filters large field values near the border, where the maximum value of the harmonic background field is located. The effectiveness of mSMV for artifact removal was evaluated by comparing with existing QSM algorithms in numerical brain simulation as well as using in vivo human data acquired from 11 healthy volunteers and 93 patients. Numerical simulation showed that mSMV reduces shadow artifacts and improves QSM accuracy. Better shadow reduction, as demonstrated by lower QSM variation in the gray matter and higher QSM image quality score, was also observed in healthy subjects and in patients with hemorrhages, stroke and multiple sclerosis. The mSMV algorithm allows QSM maps that are substantially equivalent to those obtained using SMV-filtered dipole inversion without eroding the volume of interest.

Title: Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting
Authors: Thuan Pham, Xingpeng Li
Abstract: Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.

Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.

Title: Generalizable Representation Learning for fMRI-based Neurological Disorder Identification
Authors: Wenhui Cui, Haleh Akrami, Anand A. Joshi, Richard M. Leahy
Abstract: Despite the impressive advances achieved using deep learning for functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in tasks such as identifying neurological disorders. For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to identify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. This approach enables generalization to challenging clinical tasks featuring scarce training data. We achieve this by leveraging self-supervised learning on the control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a particular supervised task and incorporating meta-learning to improve the generalization across domains. To explore the generalizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical applications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring scarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification. Results demonstrate the superiority of our representation learning strategy on diverse clinically-relevant tasks. Code is publicly available at this https URL

Title: An unsupervised method for MRI recovery: Deep image prior with structured sparsity
Authors: Muhammad Ahmad Sultan, Chong Chen, Yingmin Liu, Katarzyna Gil, Karolina Zareba, Rizwan Ahmad
Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.

Title: Zero-Shot Semantic Communication with Multimodal Foundation Models
Authors: Jiangjing Hu, Haotian Wu, Wenjing Zhang, Fengyu Wang, Wenjun Xu, Hui Gao, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: Most existing semantic communication (SemCom) systems use deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) to encode task-specific semantics in a goal-oriented manner. However, their reliance on predefined tasks and datasets significantly limits their flexibility and generalizability in practical deployments. Multi-modal foundation models provide a promising solution by generating universal semantic tokens. Inspired by this, we introduce SemCLIP, a zero-shot SemCom framework leveraging the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model. By transmitting CLIP-generated image tokens instead of raw images, SemCLIP enables efficient SemCom under low bandwidth and challenging channel conditions, facilitating diverse downstream tasks and zero-shot applications. Specifically, we propose a DeepJSCC scheme for efficient CLIP token encoding. To mitigate potential degradation caused by compression and channel noise, a multi-modal transmission-aware prompt learning mechanism is designed at the receiver, which adapts prompts based on transmission quality, enhancing system robustness and channel adaptability. Simulation results demonstrate that SemCLIP outperforms the baselines, achieving a $41\%$ improvement in zero-shot performance at low signal-to-noise ratios. Meanwhile, SemCLIP reduces bandwidth usage by more than $50$-fold compared to alternative image transmission methods, demonstrating the potential of foundation models towards a generalized, task-agnostic SemCom solution.

Title: LEAVS: An LLM-based Labeler for Abdominal CT Supervision
Authors: Ricardo Bigolin Lanfredi, Yan Zhuang, Mark Finkelstein, Praveen Thoppey Srinivasan Balamuralikrishna, Luke Krembs, Brandon Khoury, Arthi Reddy, Pritam Mukherjee, Neil M. Rofsky, Ronald M. Summers
Abstract: Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.

Title: Geometry of the Feasible Output Regions of Grid-Interfacing Inverters with Current Limits
Authors: Lauren Streitmatter, Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang
Abstract: Many resources in the grid connect to power grids via programmable grid-interfacing inverters that can provide grid services and offer greater control flexibility and faster response times compared to synchronous generators. However, the current through the inverter needs to be limited to protect the semiconductor components. Existing controllers are designed using somewhat ad hoc methods, for example, by adding current limiters to preexisting control loops, which can lead to stability issues or overly conservative operations. In this paper, we study the geometry of the feasible output region of a current-limited inverter. We show that under a commonly used model, the feasible region is convex. We provide an explicit characterization of this region, which allows us to efficiently find the optimal operating points of the inverter. We demonstrate how knowing the feasible set and its convexity allows us to improve upon existing grid-forming inverters such that their steady-state currents always remain within the current magnitude limit, whereas standard grid-forming controllers can lead to instabilities and violations.

Title: BrainMRDiff: A Diffusion Model for Anatomically Consistent Brain MRI Synthesis
Authors: Moinak Bhattacharya, Saumya Gupta, Annie Singh, Chao Chen, Gagandeep Singh, Prateek Prasanna
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made publicly available soon.

Title: LLM-Enhanced Symbolic Control for Safety-Critical Applications
Authors: Amir Bayat, Alessandro Abate, Necmiye Ozay, Raphael M. Jungers
Abstract: Motivated by Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0, we introduce a framework for synthesizing Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD) for reach-avoid problems from Natural Language (NL) specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs). A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.

Title: Exploring Spatiotemporal Emotional Synchrony in Dyadic Interactions: The Role of Speech Conditions in Facial and Vocal Affective Alignment
Authors: Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela, Yukie Nagai
Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony, this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities. Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer, more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective alignment in real world interaction.

Title: Articulatory Feature Prediction from Surface EMG during Speech Production
Authors: Jihwan Lee, Kevin Huang, Kleanthis Avramidis, Simon Pistrosch, Monica Gonzalez-Machorro, Yoonjeong Lee, Björn Schuller, Louis Goldstein, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: We present a model for predicting articulatory features from surface electromyography (EMG) signals during speech production. The proposed model integrates convolutional layers and a Transformer block, followed by separate predictors for articulatory features. Our approach achieves a high prediction correlation of approximately 0.9 for most articulatory features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these predicted articulatory features can be decoded into intelligible speech waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first method to decode speech waveforms from surface EMG via articulatory features, offering a novel approach to EMG-based speech synthesis. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between EMG electrode placement and articulatory feature predictability, providing knowledge-driven insights for optimizing EMG electrode configurations. The source code and decoded speech samples are publicly available.

Title: Non-rigid Motion Correction for MRI Reconstruction via Coarse-To-Fine Diffusion Models
Authors: Frederic Wang, Jonathan I. Tamir
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging. We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency components are sampled during each motion state.

Title: OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec for Image Compression Across Multiple Bit-rates
Authors: Jinpei Guo, Yifei Ji, Zheng Chen, Kai Liu, Min Liu, Wang Rao, Wenbo Li, Yong Guo, Yulun Zhang
Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Low-Rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Backbones for Energy-Efficient Image Coding for Machine
Authors: Yichi Zhang, Zhihao Duan, Yuning Huang, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) focuses on optimizing image compression for AI-driven analysis rather than human perception. Existing ICM frameworks often rely on separate codecs for specific tasks, leading to significant storage requirements, training overhead, and computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient framework that leverages pre-trained vision backbones to extract robust and versatile latent representations suitable for multiple tasks. We introduce a task-specific low-rank adaptation mechanism, which refines the pre-trained features to be both compressible and tailored to downstream applications. This design minimizes trainable parameters and reduces energy costs for multi-task scenarios. By jointly optimizing task performance and entropy minimization, our method enables efficient adaptation to diverse tasks and datasets without full fine-tuning, achieving high coding efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional codecs and pre-processors, offering an energy-efficient and effective solution for ICM applications. The code and the supplementary materials will be available at: this https URL.

Title: How We Won the ISLES'24 Challenge by Preprocessing
Authors: Tianyi Ren, Juampablo E. Heras Rivera, Hitender Oswal, Yutong Pan, William Henry, Sophie Walters, Mehmet Kurt
Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

Title: VietASR: Achieving Industry-level Vietnamese ASR with 50-hour labeled data and Large-Scale Speech Pretraining
Authors: Jianheng Zhuo, Yifan Yang, Yiwen Shao, Yong Xu, Dong Yu, Kai Yu, Xie Chen
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made remarkable progress but heavily relies on large-scale labeled data, which is scarce for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. While existing systems such as Whisper, USM, and MMS achieve promising performance, their efficacy remains inadequate in terms of training costs, latency, and accessibility. To address these issues, we propose VietASR, a novel ASR training pipeline that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data and a small set of labeled data. Through multi-iteration ASR-biased self-supervised learning on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, VietASR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for enhancing ASR performance. Experiments demonstrate that pre-training on 70,000-hour unlabeled data and fine-tuning on merely 50-hour labeled data yield a lightweight but powerful ASR model. It outperforms Whisper Large-v3 and commercial ASR systems on real-world data. Our code and models will be open-sourced to facilitate research in low-resource ASR.

Title: Gauss-Ramanujan Functions: Constructions, Properties, and Applications in Communications and Signal Processing
Authors: Sainath Bitragunta
Abstract: In this article, I construct a new set of functions based on Ramanujan sequences (RSEs), Gaussian pulse (GP), and its delayed Gaussian pulse (DGP). The motivation for this construction is based on the special properties of RSEs, GP, and DGP. First, I present a procedure for constructing Gauss-Ramanujan (GauRam) functions using selected RSEs. I develop an insightful analysis for deterministic and stochastic overlap between GP and DGP. Specifically, I present exact and closed form approximation expressions for delay-averaged GP and DGP overlap and then evaluate them numerically. Later, I derive and analyze the mathematical (spectral) properties of selected GauRam functions. I extend the analysis by analyzing the Hilbert transform of the first-order GauRam function and validating orthogonality and its usefulness in analytic signal representations. Furthermore, I present insightful applications of these functions in communications and signal processing. Specifically, I present the continuous-wave Gauss-Ramanujan modulation (GRM) scheme, Gauss-Ramanujan Shift Keying (GRSK) scheme, and Gauss-Ramanujan wavelets and their analysis and comparisons with benchmarking. The desirable properties of these novel modulation schemes and wavelets enable their use in next-generation hybrid and energy-efficient communication systems and signal processing.

Title: Surf2CT: Cascaded 3D Flow Matching Models for Torso 3D CT Synthesis from Skin Surface
Authors: Siyeop Yoon, Yujin Oh, Pengfei Jin, Sifan Song, Matthew Tivnan, Dufan Wu, Xiang Li, Quanzheng Li
Abstract: We present Surf2CT, a novel cascaded flow matching framework that synthesizes full 3D computed tomography (CT) volumes of the human torso from external surface scans and simple demographic data (age, sex, height, weight). This is the first approach capable of generating realistic volumetric internal anatomy images solely based on external body shape and demographics, without any internal imaging. Surf2CT proceeds through three sequential stages: (1) Surface Completion, reconstructing a complete signed distance function (SDF) from partial torso scans using conditional 3D flow matching; (2) Coarse CT Synthesis, generating a low-resolution CT volume from the completed SDF and demographic information; and (3) CT Super-Resolution, refining the coarse volume into a high-resolution CT via a patch-wise conditional flow model. Each stage utilizes a 3D-adapted EDM2 backbone trained via flow matching. We trained our model on a combined dataset of 3,198 torso CT scans (approximately 1.13 million axial slices) sourced from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the AutoPET challenge. Evaluation on 700 paired torso surface-CT cases demonstrated strong anatomical fidelity: organ volumes exhibited small mean percentage differences (range from -11.1% to 4.4%), and muscle/fat body composition metrics matched ground truth with strong correlation (range from 0.67 to 0.96). Lung localization had minimal bias (mean difference -2.5 mm), and surface completion significantly improved metrics (Chamfer distance: from 521.8 mm to 2.7 mm; Intersection-over-Union: from 0.87 to 0.98). Surf2CT establishes a new paradigm for non-invasive internal anatomical imaging using only external data, opening opportunities for home-based healthcare, preventive medicine, and personalized clinical assessments without the risks associated with conventional imaging techniques.

Title: Quantitative Verification with Neural Networks
Authors: Alessandro Abate, Alec Edwards, Mirco Giacobbe, Hashan Punchihewa, Diptarko Roy
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to the quantitative verification of probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models. Our approach leverages neural networks to compute tight and sound bounds for the probability that a stochastic process hits a target condition within finite time. This problem subsumes a variety of quantitative verification questions, from the reachability and safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models, to the study of assertion-violation and termination analysis of probabilistic programs. We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed. We demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmarks that, thanks to the expressive power of neural networks, our method yields smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing symbolic methods in all cases, and that our approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.

Title: A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security
Authors: Weixuan Chen, Shuo Shao, Qianqian Yang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ping Zhang
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure SemCom approach based on superposition codes, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper' s reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping.

Title: Can Audio Reveal Music Performance Difficulty? Insights from the Piano Syllabus Dataset
Authors: Pedro Ramoneda, Minhee Lee, Dasaem Jeong, J.J. Valero-Mas, Xavier Serra
Abstract: Automatically estimating the performance difficulty of a music piece represents a key process in music education to create tailored curricula according to the individual needs of the students. Given its relevance, the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) field depicts some proof-of-concept works addressing this task that mainly focuses on high-level music abstractions such as machine-readable scores or music sheet images. In this regard, the potential of directly analyzing audio recordings has been generally neglected, which prevents students from exploring diverse music pieces that may not have a formal symbolic-level transcription. This work pioneers in the automatic estimation of performance difficulty of music pieces on audio recordings with two precise contributions: (i) the first audio-based difficulty estimation dataset -- namely, Piano Syllabus (PSyllabus) dataset -- featuring 7,901 piano pieces across 11 difficulty levels from 1,233 composers; and (ii) a recognition framework capable of managing different input representations -- both unimodal and multimodal manners -- directly derived from audio to perform the difficulty estimation task. The comprehensive experimentation comprising different pre-training schemes, input modalities, and multi-task scenarios prove the validity of the proposal and establishes PSyllabus as a reference dataset for audio-based difficulty estimation in the MIR field. The dataset as well as the developed code and trained models are publicly shared to promote further research in the field.

Title: Nonlinear Network Identifiability with Full Excitations
Authors: Renato Vizuete, Julien M. Hendrickx
Abstract: We derive conditions for the identifiability of nonlinear networks characterized by additive dynamics at the level of the edges when all the nodes are excited. In contrast to linear systems, we show that the measurement of all sinks is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs, under the assumption that dynamics are described by analytic functions without constant terms (i.e., $f(0)=0$). But if constant terms are present, then the identifiability is impossible as soon as one node has more than one in-neighbor. In the case of general digraphs that may contain cycles, we consider additively separable functions for the analysis of the identifiability, and we show that the measurement of one node of all the sinks of the condensation digraph is necessary and sufficient. Several examples are added to illustrate the results.

Title: Approximate Thompson Sampling for Learning Linear Quadratic Regulators with $O(\sqrt{T})$ Regret
Authors: Yeoneung Kim, Gihun Kim, Jiwhan Park, Insoon Yang
Abstract: We propose a novel Thompson sampling algorithm that learns linear quadratic regulators (LQR) with a Bayesian regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Our method leverages Langevin dynamics with a carefully designed preconditioner and incorporates a simple excitation mechanism. We show that the excitation signal drives the minimum eigenvalue of the preconditioner to grow over time, thereby accelerating the approximate posterior sampling process. Furthermore, we establish nontrivial concentration properties of the approximate posteriors generated by our algorithm. These properties enable us to bound the moments of the system state and attain an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound without relying on the restrictive assumptions that are often used in the literature.

Title: QMamba: On First Exploration of Vision Mamba for Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Fengbin Guan, Xin Li, Zihao Yu, Yiting Lu, Zhibo Chen
Abstract: In this work, we take the first exploration of the recently popular foundation model, i.e., State Space Model/Mamba, in image quality assessment (IQA), aiming at observing and excavating the perception potential in vision Mamba. A series of works on Mamba has shown its significant potential in various fields, e.g., segmentation and classification. However, the perception capability of Mamba remains under-explored. Consequently, we propose QMamba by revisiting and adapting the Mamba model for three crucial IQA tasks, i.e., task-specific, universal, and transferable IQA, which reveals its clear advantages over existing foundational models, e.g., Swin Transformer, ViT, and CNNs, in terms of perception and computational cost. To improve the transferability of QMamba, we propose the StylePrompt tuning paradigm, where lightweight mean and variance prompts are injected to assist task-adaptive transfer learning of pre-trained QMamba for different downstream IQA tasks. Compared with existing prompt tuning strategies, our StylePrompt enables better perceptual transfer with lower computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic, authentic IQA datasets, and cross IQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed QMamba. The code will be available at: this https URL

Title: Epsilon-VAE: Denoising as Visual Decoding
Authors: Long Zhao, Sanghyun Woo, Ziyu Wan, Yandong Li, Han Zhang, Boqing Gong, Hartwig Adam, Xuhui Jia, Ting Liu
Abstract: In generative modeling, tokenization simplifies complex data into compact, structured representations, creating a more efficient, learnable space. For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approaches. By adopting iterative reconstruction through diffusion, our autoencoder, namely Epsilon-VAE, achieves high reconstruction quality, which in turn enhances downstream generation quality by 22% at the same compression rates or provides 2.3x inference speedup through increasing compression rates. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.

Title: SGD Jittering: A Training Strategy for Robust and Accurate Model-Based Architectures
Authors: Peimeng Guan, Mark A. Davenport
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.

Title: Visatronic: A Multimodal Decoder-Only Model for Speech Synthesis
Authors: Akshita Gupta, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Karren Dai Yang, Richard He Bai, Zakaria Aldeneh, Navdeep Jaitly
Abstract: The rapid progress of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) has fueled significantly improvement in the capabilities of machine learning systems that benefit from mutlimodal input data. However, existing multimodal models are predominantly built on top of pre-trained LLMs, which can limit accurate modeling of temporal dependencies across other modalities and thus limit the model's ability to jointly process and leverage multimodal inputs. To specifically investigate the alignment of text, video, and speech modalities in LLM-style (decoder-only) models, we consider a simplified multimodal generation task, Video-Text to Speech (VTTS): speech generation conditioned on both its corresponding text and video of talking people. The ultimate goal is to generate speech that not only follows the text but also aligns temporally with the video and is consistent with the facial expressions. In this paper, we first introduce Visatronic, a unified multimodal decoder-only transformer model that adopts an LLM-style architecture to embed visual, textual, and speech inputs into a shared subspace, treating all modalities as temporally aligned token streams. Next, we carefully explore different token mixing strategies to understand the best way to propagate information from the steps where video and text conditioning is input to the steps where the audio is generated. We extensively evaluate Visatronic on the challenging VoxCeleb2 dataset and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to LRS3, where Visatronic, trained on VoxCeleb2, achieves a 4.5% WER, outperforming prior SOTA methods trained only on LRS3, which report a 21.4% WER. Additionally, we propose a new objective metric, TimeSync, specifically designed to measure phoneme-level temporal alignment between generated and reference speech, further ensuring synchronization quality.

Title: SCoTT: Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking for Wireless-Aware Robot Navigation in Digital Twins
Authors: Aladin Djuhera, Amin Seffo, Vlad C. Andrei, Holger Boche, Walid Saad
Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.

Authors: An T. Le, Kay Hansel, João Carvalho, Joe Watson, Julen Urain, Armin Biess, Georgia Chalvatzaki, Jan Peters
Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.

Title: Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning
Authors: Stefan Smeu, Dragos-Alexandru Boldisor, Dan Oneata, Elisabeta Oneata
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.

Title: Robustness-enhanced Myoelectric Control with GAN-based Open-set Recognition
Authors: Cheng Wang, Ziyang Feng, Pin Zhang, Manjiang Cao, Yiming Yuan, Tengfei Chang
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used in human motion recognition and medical rehabilitation, yet their variability and susceptibility to noise significantly limit the reliability of myoelectric control systems. Existing recognition algorithms often fail to handle unfamiliar actions effectively, leading to system instability and errors. This paper proposes a novel framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the robustness and usability of myoelectric control systems by enabling open-set recognition. The method incorporates a GAN-based discriminator to identify and reject unknown actions, maintaining system stability by preventing misclassifications. Experimental evaluations on publicly available and self-collected datasets demonstrate a recognition accuracy of 97.6\% for known actions and a 23.6\% improvement in Active Error Rate (AER) after rejecting unknown actions. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and suitable for deployment on edge devices, making it practical for real-world applications.

Authors: Che Liu, Yingji Zhang, Dong Zhang, Weijie Zhang, Chenggong Gong, Haohan Li, Yu Lu, Shilin Zhou, Yue Lu, Ziliang Gan, Ziao Wang, Junwei Liao, Haipang Wu, Ji Liu, André Freitas, Qifan Wang, Zenglin Xu, Rongjuncheng Zhang, Yong Dai
Abstract: This work proposes an industry-level omni-modal large language model (LLM) pipeline that integrates auditory, visual, and linguistic modalities to overcome challenges such as limited tri-modal datasets, high computational costs, and complex feature alignments. Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark. (6) An in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment reveals that incorporating the audio modality enhances representational alignment between vision and language.

Title: Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer
Authors: Ali Baheri, Cecilia O. Alm
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly couples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.

Title: Self-Supervised Enhancement of Forward-Looking Sonar Images: Bridging Cross-Modal Degradation Gaps through Feature Space Transformation and Multi-Frame Fusion
Authors: Zhisheng Zhang, Peng Zhang, Fengxiang Wang, Liangli Ma, Fuchun Sun
Abstract: Enhancing forward-looking sonar images is critical for accurate underwater target detection. Current deep learning methods mainly rely on supervised training with simulated data, but the difficulty in obtaining high-quality real-world paired data limits their practical use and generalization. Although self-supervised approaches from remote sensing partially alleviate data shortages, they neglect the cross-modal degradation gap between sonar and remote sensing images. Directly transferring pretrained weights often leads to overly smooth sonar images, detail loss, and insufficient brightness. To address this, we propose a feature-space transformation that maps sonar images from the pixel domain to a robust feature domain, effectively bridging the degradation gap. Additionally, our self-supervised multi-frame fusion strategy leverages complementary inter-frame information to naturally remove speckle noise and enhance target-region brightness. Experiments on three self-collected real-world forward-looking sonar datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively suppressing noise, preserving detailed edges, and substantially improving brightness, demonstrating strong potential for underwater target detection applications.

Title: Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine Using Koopman Eigenfunction Model
Authors: David Grasev
Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Title: A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Efficient Multichannel Acoustic Feedback Control
Authors: Yuan-Kuei Wu, Juan Azcarreta, Kashyap Patel, Buye Xu, Jung-Suk Lee, Sanha Lee, Ashutosh Pandey
Abstract: This study presents a deep-learning framework for controlling multichannel acoustic feedback in audio devices. Traditional digital signal processing methods struggle with convergence when dealing with highly correlated noise such as feedback. We introduce a Convolutional Recurrent Network that efficiently combines spatial and temporal processing, significantly enhancing speech enhancement capabilities with lower computational demands. Our approach utilizes three training methods: In-a-Loop Training, Teacher Forcing, and a Hybrid strategy with a Multichannel Wiener Filter, optimizing performance in complex acoustic environments. This scalable framework offers a robust solution for real-world applications, making significant advances in Acoustic Feedback Control technology.

Title: Performance Guaranteed Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning: A Sliding Mode Approach
Authors: Huazi Pan, Yanjun Zhang, Leo Yu Zhang, Scott Adams, Abbas Kouzani, Suiyang Khoo
Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS) issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by 10%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state, achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning rates.

Title: Foundation Model Hidden Representations for Heart Rate Estimation from Auscultation
Authors: Jingping Nie, Dung T. Tran, Karan Thakkar, Vasudha Kowtha, Jon Huang, Carlos Avendano, Erdrin Azemi, Vikramjit Mitra
Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024 (which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.

Title: Stereo Radargrammetry Using Deep Learning from Airborne SAR Images
Authors: Tatsuya Sasayama, Shintaro Ito, Koichi Ito, Takafumi Aoki
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a stereo radargrammetry method using deep learning from airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Deep learning-based methods are considered to suffer less from geometric image modulation, while there is no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods. We create a SAR image dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence method. The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel interpolation without ground projection of the SAR image and divides the SAR image into patches for processing, which makes it possible to apply deep learning. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a wider range and more accurate elevation measurements compared to conventional methods.

Title: Hybrid Disagreement-Diversity Active Learning for Bioacoustic Sound Event Detection
Authors: Shiqi Zhang, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity conservation but faces practical challenges during model development and training: limited amounts of annotated data, sparse events, species diversity, and class imbalance. To address these challenges efficiently with a limited labeling budget, we apply the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT), an active learning method integrating committee voting disagreement and diversity analysis. We also refine an existing BioSED dataset specifically for evaluating active learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MFFT achieves a mAP of 68% when cold-starting and 71% when warm-starting (which is close to the fully-supervised mAP of 75%) while using only 2.3% of the annotations. Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are critical for monitoring endangered species, demonstrating its practical value.
