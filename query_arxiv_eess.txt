Title: Global and Local Contrastive Learning for Joint Representations from Cardiac MRI and ECG
Authors: Alexander Selivanov, Philip Müller, Özgün Turgut, Nil Stolt-Ansó, Daniel Rückert
Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at: this https URL

Title: Building Lightweight Semantic Segmentation Models for Aerial Images Using Dual Relation Distillation
Authors: Minglong Li, Lianlei Shan, Weiqiang Wang, Ke Lv, Bin Luo, Si-Bao Chen
Abstract: Recently, there have been significant improvements in the accuracy of CNN models for semantic segmentation. However, these models are often heavy and suffer from low inference speed, which limits their practical application. To address this issue, knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising approach to achieve a good trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel dual relation distillation (DRD) technique that transfers both spatial and channel relations in feature maps from a cumbersome model (teacher) to a compact model (student). Specifically, we compute spatial and channel relation maps separately for the teacher and student models, and then align corresponding relation maps by minimizing their distance. Since the teacher model usually learns more information and collects richer spatial and channel correlations than the student model, transferring these correlations from the teacher to the student can help the student mimic the teacher better in terms of feature distribution, thus improving the segmentation accuracy of the student model. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, including two widely adopted benchmarks in the remote sensing field (Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets) and one popular benchmark in general scene (Cityscapes dataset). The experimental results demonstrate that our novel distillation framework can significantly boost the performance of the student network without incurring extra computational overhead.

Title: U-R-VEDA: Integrating UNET, Residual Links, Edge and Dual Attention, and Vision Transformer for Accurate Semantic Segmentation of CMRs
Authors: Racheal Mukisa, Arvind K. Bansal
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.

Title: Distributed Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Networks
Authors: Yiming Wang, Arthur N. Montanari, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: Nonlinear networks are often multistable, exhibiting coexisting stable states with competing regions of attraction (ROAs). As a result, ROAs can have complex "tentacle-like" morphologies that are challenging to characterize analytically or computationally. In addition, the high dimensionality of the state space prohibits the automated construction of Lyapunov functions using state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. In this letter, we propose a distributed approach for the construction of Lyapunov functions based solely on local information. To this end, we establish an augmented comparison lemma that characterizes the existence conditions of partial Lyapunov functions, while also accounting for residual effects caused by the associated dimensionality reduction. These theoretical results allow us to formulate an SOS optimization that iteratively constructs such partial functions, whose aggregation forms a composite Lyapunov function. The resulting composite function provides accurate convex approximations of both the volumes and shapes of the ROAs. We validate our method on networks of van der Pol and Ising oscillators, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing high-dimensional systems with non-convex ROAs.

Title: Noise-Tolerant Hybrid Approach for Data-Driven Predictive Control
Authors: Mahmood Mazare, Hossein Ramezani
Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in hybrid data-driven predictive control: the effect of measurement noise on Hankel matrices. While noise is handled in direct and indirect methods, hybrid approaches often overlook its impact during trajectory estimation. We propose a Noise-Tolerant Data-Driven Predictive Control (NTDPC) framework that integrates singular value decomposition to separate system dynamics from noise within reduced-order Hankel matrices. This enables accurate prediction with shorter data horizons and lower computational effort. A sensitivity index is introduced to support horizon selection under different noise levels. Simulation results indicate improved robustness and efficiency compared to existing hybrid methods.

Title: Precise Near-Field Beam Training with DFT Codebook based on Amplitude-only Measurement
Authors: Zijun Wang, Shawn Tsai, Rama Kiran, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) operating in high-frequency bands have spurred the development of near-field communication, driving advancements in beam training and signal processing design. In this work, we present a low-complexity near-field beam training scheme that fully utilizes the conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook designed for far-field users. We begin by analyzing the received beam pattern in the near field and derive closed-form expressions for the beam width and central gain. These analytical results enable the definition of an angle-dependent, modified Rayleigh distance, which effectively distinguishes near-field and far-field user regimes. Building on the analysis, we develop a direct and computationally efficient method to estimate user distance, with a complexity of O(1), and further improve its accuracy through a simple refinement. Simulation results demonstrate significant gains in both single- and multi-user settings, with up to 2.38 dB SNR improvement over exhaustive search. To further enhance estimation accuracy, we additionally propose a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based refinement method, leveraging the Rician distribution of signal amplitudes and achieving accuracy close to the Cramer--Rao bound (CRB). Simulation shows the single-user and multi-user achievable rates can both approach those obtained with ideal channel state information.

Title: Physical Limits of Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution over Long-Distance Satellite Links
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna, Saif Al-Kuwari, Khalid Qaraqe
Abstract: Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, such as E91 and BBM92, offer strong information-theoretic security and are naturally suited for satellite-to-satellite QKD (SatQKD) links. However, implementing these protocols over long-distance inter-satellite free-space optical (FSO) channels poses critical physical-layer challenges that are not addressed in the existing literature. In particular, photon losses due to beam divergence, pointing errors, and background noise can severely degrade the key generation rate and quantum bit error rate (QBER), especially under narrow receiver field-of-view (FoV) constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of entanglement-based inter-satellite QKD, focusing on photon-level modeling and the impact of practical impairments. We develop analytical expressions for signal detection probabilities, background photon influence, multi-pair emissions, and QBER, incorporating key parameters such as link distance, transmitter tracking jitter, receiver misalignment, and photon pair generation rate. Simulation results reveal the nonlinear sensitivity of system performance to tracking error and FoV limitations, and highlight optimal parameter regimes that jointly maximize secret key rate while maintaining QBER below acceptable thresholds. The proposed model provides actionable design insights for reliable and efficient deployment of entanglement-based SatQKD systems.

Title: DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.

Title: Compact Analytical Model for Real-Time Evaluation of OAM-Based Inter-Satellite Links
Authors: Mohammad Taghi Dabiri, Mazen Hasna
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient analytical framework for evaluating the performance of inter-satellite communication systems utilizing orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams under pointing errors. An accurate analytical model is first developed to characterize intermodal crosstalk caused by beam misalignment in OAM-based inter-satellite links. Building upon this model, we derive efficient expressions to analyze and optimize system performance in terms of bit error rate (BER). Unlike traditional Monte Carlo-based methods that are computationally intensive, the proposed approach offers accurate performance predictions. This enables a substantial decrease in computation time while maintaining high accuracy, thanks to the use of analytical expressions for both crosstalk and BER. This fast and accurate evaluation capability is particularly critical for dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, where network topology and channel conditions change rapidly, requiring real-time link adaptation. Furthermore, we systematically design and evaluate asymmetric OAM mode sets, which significantly outperform symmetric configurations in the presence of pointing errors. Our results also reveal key insights into the interaction between beam divergence, tracking accuracy, and link distance, demonstrating that the proposed framework enables real-time optimization of system parameters with high fidelity. The analytical findings are rigorously validated against extensive Monte Carlo simulations, confirming their practical applicability for high-mobility optical wireless systems such as LEO satellite networks.

Title: Doppler Estimation and Compensation Techniques in LoRa Direct-to-Satellite Communications
Authors: Jamil Farhat, Gianni Pasolini, Enrico Paolini, Muhammad Asad Ullah, Richard Demo Souza
Abstract: Within the LPWAN framework, the LoRa modulation adopted by LoRaWAN technology has garnered significant interest as a connectivity solution for IoT applications due to its ability to offer low-cost, low-power, and long-range communications. One emerging use case of LoRa is DtS connectivity, which extends coverage to remote areas for supporting IoT operations. The satellite IoT industry mainly prefers LEO because it has lower launch costs and less path loss compared to Geostationary orbit. However, a major drawback of LEO satellites is the impact of the Doppler effect caused by their mobility. Earlier studies have confirmed that the Doppler effect significantly degrades the LoRa DtS performance. In this paper, we propose four frameworks for Doppler estimation and compensation in LoRa DtS connectivity and numerically compare the performance against the ideal scenario without the Doppler effect. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-offs among these frameworks by analyzing the interplay between spreading factor, and other key parameters related to the Doppler effect. The results provide insights into how to achieve robust LoRa configurations for DtS connectivity.

Authors: Naoki Ishikawa, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Petar Popovski, Robert W. Heath Jr
Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is, however, still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and uncovering a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that classical heuristics can sharpen certain quantum parameters, underscoring the complementary strengths of classical and quantum computing. This article aims to catalyze interdisciplinary research at the frontier of quantum information processing and future communication systems.

Title: Resilience Through Escalation: A Graph-Based PACE Architecture for Satellite Threat Response
Authors: Anouar Boumeftah, Sarah McKenzie-Picot, Peter Klimas, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: Satellite systems increasingly face operational risks from jamming, cyberattacks, and electromagnetic disruptions. Traditional redundancy strategies often fail against dynamic, multi-vector threats. This paper introduces a resilience-by-design framework grounded in the PACE (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) methodology, originally developed for tactical communications in military operations, adapting it to satellite systems through a layered state-transition model informed by threat scoring frameworks such as CVSS, DREAD, and NASA's risk matrix. We define a dynamic resilience index to quantify system adaptability and implement three PACE variants: static, adaptive, and softmax-based decision models, to evaluate resilience under diverse disruption scenarios. The proposed approach highlights the effectiveness of lightweight, decision-aware fallback mechanisms in improving survivability and operational continuity for next-generation space assets.

Title: Development of MR spectral analysis method robust against static magnetic field inhomogeneity
Authors: Shuki Maruyama, Hidenori Takeshima
Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra. The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by 26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra. The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to 1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

Title: Co-Design of Sensing, Communications, and Control for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks
Authors: Haijia Jin, Jun Wu, Weijie Yuan, Fan Liu, Yuanhao Cui
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) services and the evolution toward the sixth generation (6G) have positioned unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as critical enablers of low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs). This work investigates the co-design of integrated sensing, communication, and control ($\mathbf{SC^{2}}$) for multi-UAV cooperative systems with finite blocklength (FBL) transmission. In particular, the UAVs continuously monitor the state of the field robots and transmit their observations to the robot controller to ensure stable control while cooperating to localize an unknown sensing target (ST). To this end, a weighted optimization problem is first formulated by jointly considering the control and localization performance in terms of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost and the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. The resultant problem, optimizing resource allocations, the UAVs' deployment positions, and multi-user scheduling, is non-convex. To circumvent this challenge, we first derive a closed-form expression of the LQR cost with respect to other variables. Subsequently, the non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into a series of sub-problems by leveraging the alternating optimization (AO) approach, in which the difference of convex functions (DC) programming and projected gradient descent (PGD) method are employed to obtain an efficient near-optimal solution. Furthermore, the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to the benchmark schemes and reveal the trade-off between control and sensing performance.

Title: Optimal Parameter Design for Power Electronic Converters Using a Probabilistic Learning-Based Stochastic Surrogate Model
Authors: Akash Mahajan, Shivam Chaturvedi, Srijita Das, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui
Abstract: The selection of optimal design for power electronic converter parameters involves balancing efficiency and thermal constraints to ensure high performance without compromising safety. This paper introduces a probabilistic-learning-based stochastic surrogate modeling framework to address this challenge and significantly reduce the time required during the design phase. The approach begins with a neural network classifier that evaluates the feasibility of parameter configurations, effectively filtering out unsafe and/or impractical inputs. Subsequently, a probabilistic prediction model estimates the converter's efficiency and temperature while quantifying prediction uncertainty, providing both performance insights and reliability metrics. Finally, a heuristic optimization-based model is employed to optimize a multi-objective function that maximizes efficiency while adhering to thermal constraints. The optimization process incorporates penalty terms to discourage solutions that violate practical thresholds, ensuring actionable and realistic recommendations. An advanced heuristic optimization method is used to find the optimal solution and is compared with several well-known search algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu-Search (TS), and Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC). The results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes, offering a robust solution for advancing power electronics design.

Title: Analysis of Null Related Beampattern Measures and Signal Quantization Effects for Linear Differential Microphone Arrays
Authors: Shweta Pal, Arun Kumar, Monika Agrawal
Abstract: A differential microphone array (DMA) offers enhanced capabilities to obtain sharp nulls at the cost of relatively broad peaks in the beam power pattern. This can be used for applications that require nullification or attenuation of interfering sources. To the best of our knowledge, the existing literature lacks measures that directly assess the efficacy of nulls, and null-related measures have not been investigated in the context of differential microphone arrays (DMAs). This paper offers new insights about the utility of DMAs by proposing measures that characterize the nulls in their beam power patterns. We investigate the performance of differential beamformers by presenting and evaluating null-related measures namely null depth (ND) and Null Width (NW) as a function of depth level relative to the beam power pattern maxima. A study of signal quantization effects due to data acquisition for 1st, 2nd and 3rd order linear DMAs and for different beampatterns i.e. dipole, cardioid, hypercardioid and supercardioid is presented. An analytical expression for the quantized beamformed output for any general $ N^{th} $ order DMA is formulated. Simulation results of the variation of ND with number of quantization bits and the variation of NW as a function of depth are also presented and inferences are drawn. Lab experiments are conducted in a fully anechoic room to support the simulation results. The measured beampattern exhibits a pronounced null depth, confirming the effectiveness of the experimental setup.

Title: CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate
Authors: Hankun Wang, Yiwei Guo, Chongtian Shao, Bohan Li, Xie Chen, Kai Yu
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Post-training for Deepfake Speech Detection
Authors: Wanying Ge, Xin Wang, Xuechen Liu, Junichi Yamagishi
Abstract: We introduce a post-training approach that adapts self-supervised learning (SSL) models for deepfake speech detection by bridging the gap between general pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning. We present AntiDeepfake models, a series of post-trained models developed using a large-scale multilingual speech dataset containing over 56,000 hours of genuine speech and 18,000 hours of speech with various artifacts in over one hundred languages. Experimental results show that the post-trained models already exhibit strong robustness and generalization to unseen deepfake speech. When they are further fine-tuned on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset, these models consistently surpass existing state-of-the-art detectors that do not leverage post-training. Model checkpoints and source code are available online.

Title: Point Cloud Environment-Based Channel Knowledge Map Construction
Authors: Yancheng Wang, Wei Guo, Guanying Chen, Ye Zhang, Shuguang Cui
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) provides certain levels of channel state information (CSI) for an area of interest, serving as a critical enabler for environment-aware communications by reducing the overhead of frequent CSI acquisition. However, existing CKM construction schemes adopt over-simplified environment information, which significantly compromises their accuracy. To address this issue, this work proposes a joint model- and data-driven approach to construct CKM by leveraging point cloud environmental data along with a few samples of location-tagged channel information. First, we propose a novel point selector to identify subsets of point cloud that contain environmental information relevant to multipath channel gains, by constructing a set of co-focal ellipsoids based on different time of arrival (ToAs). Then, we trained a neural channel gain estimator to learn the mapping between each selected subset and its corresponding channel gain, using a real-world dataset we collected through field measurements, comprising environmental point clouds and corresponding channel data. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that: For CKM construction of power delay profile (PDP), the proposed method achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.95 dB, significantly lower than the 7.32 dB achieved by the conventional ray-tracing method; for CKM construction of received power values, i.e., radio map, it achieves an RMSE of 1.04 dB, surpassing the Kriging interpolation method with an RMSE of 1.68 dB.

Title: Characterization of Rydberg-Atom Signal Reception of Dual-Frequency Signals Coupled with Two Energy Levels
Authors: Hao Wu, Chongwu Xie, Xinyuan Yao, Kang-Da Wu, Shanchi Wu, Rui Ni, Guo-Yong Xiang, Chen Gong
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been adopted for novel radio frequency (RF) measurement technique and the sensing capability for signals in multiple frequencies makes it attractive for multi-user communication. However, unlike traditional antennas where the signals in multiple frequencies are orthogonal, the received signals of atomic sensors corresponding to different energy levels will be downconverted to the baseband simultaneously, resulting in multi-user interference. Thus, in this paper, we analyze the mutual interference characteristics of two RF signals with different carrier frequencies coupling different energy levels. We introduce the joint response coefficient based on the receiver characteristics and analyze the interference of one user to another. We analyze the bit-error rate (BER) and symbol-error rate (SER) for two signals coupling two different energy levels. We also conduct experiments to validate the BER and SER results.

Title: A Novel Framework for Integrating 3D Ultrasound into Percutaneous Liver Tumour Ablation
Authors: Shuwei Xing, Derek W. Cool, David Tessier, Elvis C.S. Chen, Terry M. Peters, Aaron Fenster
Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However, challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable 2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

Title: Uncover Treasures in DCT: Advancing JPEG Quality Enhancement by Exploiting Latent Correlations
Authors: Jing Yang, Qunliang Xing, Mai Xu, Minglang Qiao
Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images. Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput on average.

Title: Performance improvement of spatial semantic segmentation with enriched audio features and agent-based error correction for DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4
Authors: Jongyeon Park, Joonhee Lee, Do-Hyeon Lim, Hong Kook Kim, Hyeongcheol Geum, Jeong Eun Lim
Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus, these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model. Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric. Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7% compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

Title: Adversarial Training: Enhancing Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation
Authors: Shengjie Liu, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have widespread applications for optimizing resource allocation. Yet, their performance is vulnerable to distribution shifts between training and test data, say channels. In this letter, we resort to adversarial training (AT) for enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability of DNNs trained in unsupervised manner. We reformulate AT to capture the OOD degradation, and propose a one-step gradient ascent method for AT. The proposed method is validated by optimizing hybrid precoding. Simulation results showcase the enhanced OOD performance of multiple kinds of DNNs across various channel distributions, when only Rayleigh fading channels are used for training.

Title: GANet-Seg: Adversarial Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Hybrid Generative Models
Authors: Qifei Cui, Xinyu Lu
Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for brain tumor segmentation leveraging pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures. By combining a global anomaly detection module with a refined mask generation network, the proposed model accurately identifies tumor-sensitive regions and iteratively enhances segmentation precision using adversarial loss constraints. Multi-modal MRI data and synthetic image augmentation are employed to improve robustness and address the challenge of limited annotated datasets. Experimental results on the BraTS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high sensitivity and accuracy in both lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics than the baseline. This scalable method minimizes the dependency on fully annotated data, paving the way for practical real-world applications in clinical settings.

Title: Coordinated Control of Autonomous Vehicles for Traffic Density Reduction at a Signalized Junction: An MPC Approach
Authors: Rudra Sen, Subashish Datta
Abstract: The effective and safe management of traffic is a key issue due to the rapid advancement of the urban transportation system. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) possess the capability to connect with each other and adjacent infrastructure, presenting novel opportunities for enhancing traffic flow and coordination. This work proposes a dual-mode model predictive control (MPC) architecture that tackles two interrelated issues: mitigating traffic density at signalized junctions and facilitating seamless, cooperative lane changes in high-density traffic conditions. The objective of this work is to facilitate responsive decision-making for CAVs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of urban mobility. Moreover, we ensure recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed MPC scheme by the integration of an online-calculated maximal control invariant terminal set. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulation.

Title: Estimating Technical Loss without Power Flows: A Practical, Data-Driven Approach for Loss Estimation in Distribution Grids
Authors: Mohini Bariya, Genevieve Flaspohler
Abstract: Electric grids in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the world face an acute challenge. To support global decarbonisation efforts and raise millions from energy poverty, these grids must shoulder substantial load growth while integrating distributed renewable generation. However, decades of rapid and poorly funded infrastructure expansions have led to national grids in many LMICs that are strained and weak, composed of aging, faulty, and undersized infrastructure. A cause and symptom of this weakness is excessive technical loss within the grid infrastructure during energy delivery, particularly at the distribution level; network losses are regularly estimated to be well over 20 percent, compared to a baseline of 5 percent in higher-income nations. Addressing technical loss through targeted interventions is essential for bolstering grids' physical and economic strength. Unfortunately, current approaches for estimating and localizing technical loss require expensive, extensive power flow sensing, which is essentially absent in LMIC distribution systems. We present a novel approach to technical loss estimation without power flows, which leverages more readily available voltage magnitude measurements at sparse locations in the grid. This estimator puts loss estimation and localization within reach for LMIC grids globally, and provides a critical tool for the effective design, implementation, and evaluation of loss-reduction interventions.

Abstract: Shifting 6G-and-beyond wireless communication systems to higher frequency bands and the utilization of massive multiple-input multiple-output arrays will extend the near-field region, affecting beamforming and user localization schemes. In this paper, we propose a localization-based beam-focusing strategy that leverages the dominant line-of-sight (LoS) propagation arising at mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. To support this approach, we analyze the 2D-MUSIC algorithm for distance estimation by examining its spectrum in simplified, tractable setups with minimal numbers of antennas and users. Lastly, we compare the proposed localization-based beam focusing, with locations estimated via 2D-MUSIC, with zero forcing with pilot-based channel estimation in terms of uplink sum spectral efficiency. Our numerical results show that the proposed method becomes more effective under LoS-dominated propagation, short coherence blocks, and strong noise power arising at high carrier frequencies and with large bandwidths.

Title: Integrating Movable Antennas and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Coverage Enhancement
Authors: Ying Gao, Qingqing Wu, Weidong Mei, Guangji Chen, Wen Chen, Ziyuan Zheng
Abstract: This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided movable antenna (MA) system, where multiple IRSs cooperate with a multi-MA base station to extend wireless coverage to multiple designated target areas. The objective is to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across all locations within these areas through joint optimization of MA positions, IRS reflection coefficients, and transmit beamforming. To achieve this while balancing the performance-cost trade-off, we propose three coverage-enhancement schemes: the area-adaptive MA-IRS scheme, the area-adaptive MA-staIRS scheme, and the shared MA-staIRS scheme, where staIRS denotes static IRSs with reflection coefficients configured only once during installation. These schemes lead to challenging non-convex optimization problems with implicit objective functions, which are difficult to solve optimally. To address these problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework that can be applied to solve each problem efficiently albeit suboptimally. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed MA-based schemes consistently outperform their fixed-position antenna (FPA)-based counterparts under both area-adaptive and static IRS configurations, with the area-adaptive MA-IRS scheme achieving the best worst-case SNR performance; 2) as transmit antennas are typically far fewer than IRS elements, the area-adaptive MA-staIRS scheme may underperform the baseline FPA scheme with area-adaptive IRSs in terms of the worst-case SNR, but a modest increase in antenna number can reverse this trend; 3) under a fixed total cost, the optimal MA-to-IRS-element ratio for the worst-case SNR maximization is empirically found to be proportional to the reciprocal of their unit cost ratio.

Title: Hybrid Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Arabic Dialect Recognition in Low-Resource Settings
Authors: Ghazal Al-Shwayyat, Omer Nezih Gerek
Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1) Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization, providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within resource-constrained environments.

Title: ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing
Authors: Huadai Liu, Jialei Wang, Kaicheng Luo, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Zhou Zhao, Wei Xue
Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present \textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

Title: Lightweight Physics-Informed Zero-Shot Ultrasound Plane Wave Denoising
Authors: Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Mostafa Sharifzadeh, Hassan Rivaz
Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets. Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme, enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based denoising methods.

Title: Joint Scheduling of DER under Demand Charges: Structure and Approximation
Authors: Ruixiao Yang, Gulai Shen, Ahmed S. Alahmed, Chuchu Fan
Abstract: We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering frameworks with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the structure of the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based form. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to the theoretical upper bound.

Title: Exploring the Design Space of 3D MLLMs for CT Report Generation
Authors: Mohammed Baharoon, Jun Ma, Congyu Fang, Augustin Toma, Bo Wang
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at this https URL

Title: IMC-PINN-FE: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Patient-Specific Left Ventricular Finite Element Modeling with Image Motion Consistency and Biomechanical Parameter Estimation
Authors: Siyu Mu, Wei Xuan Chan, Choon Hwai Yap
Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However, conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC) with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics. Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to 0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.

Title: Drift-Adaptive Slicing-Based Resource Management for Cooperative ISAC Networks
Authors: Shisheng Hu, Jie Gao, Xue Qin, Conghao Zhou, Xinyu Huang, Mushu Li, Mingcheng He, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel drift-adaptive slicing-based resource management scheme for cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Particularly, we establish two network slices to provide sensing and communication services, respectively. In the large-timescale planning for the slices, we partition the sensing region of interest (RoI) of each mobile device and reserve network resources accordingly, facilitating low-complexity distance-based sensing target assignment in small timescales. To cope with the non-stationary spatial distributions of mobile devices and sensing targets, which can result in the drift in modeling the distributions and ineffective planning decisions, we construct digital twins (DTs) of the slices. In each DT, a drift-adaptive statistical model and an emulation function are developed for the spatial distributions in the corresponding slice, which facilitates closed-form decision-making and efficient validation of a planning decision, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed drift-adaptive slicing-based resource management scheme can increase the service satisfaction ratio by up to 18% and reduce resource consumption by up to 13.1% when compared with benchmark schemes.

Title: Spiking Neural Networks for SAR Interferometric Phase Unwrapping: A Theoretical Framework for Energy-Efficient Processing
Authors: Marc Bara
Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data, propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

Title: Structural System Identification via Validation and Adaptation
Authors: Cristian López, Keegan J. Moore
Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate, and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification, and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks, a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for different nonlinear structural systems.

Title: FINN-GL: Generalized Mixed-Precision Extensions for FPGA-Accelerated LSTMs
Authors: Shashwat Khandelwal, Jakoba Petri-Koenig, Thomas B. Preußer, Michaela Blott, Shreejith Shanker
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction. However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Title: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Cognitive Radar Resource Management
Authors: Ziyang Lu, Subodh Kalia, M. Cenk Gursoy, Chilukuri K. Mohan, Pramod K. Varshney
Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple competing objectives in dynamic environments.

Title: A Multi-Stage Framework for Multimodal Controllable Speech Synthesis
Authors: Rui Niu, Weihao Wu, Jie Chen, Long Ma, Zhiyong Wu
Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities, their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.

Title: Step-by-Step Video-to-Audio Synthesis via Negative Audio Guidance
Authors: Akio Hayakawa, Masato Ishii, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows, aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively. Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Title: Constant Modulus Waveforms for IoT-Centric Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Tian Han, Shalanika Dayarathna, Rajitha Senanayake, Peter Smith, Aryan Kaushik, Alain Mourad, Richard A. Stirling-Gallacher, Jamie Evans
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered a key enabler to support application scenarios such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in which both communications and sensing play significant roles. Multi-carrier waveforms, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), have been considered as good candidates for ISAC due to their high communications data rate and good time bandwidth property for sensing. Nevertheless, their high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) values lead to either performance degradation or an increase in system complexity. This can make OFDM unsuitable for IoT applications with insufficient resources in terms of power, system complexity, hardware size or cost. This article provides IoT-centric constant modulus waveform designs that leverage the advantage of unit PAPR and thus are more suitable in resource-limited scenarios. More specifically, several single-carrier frequency and/or phase-modulated waveforms are considered. A comprehensive discussion on their radar sensing and communications performance is conducted based on performance metrics, including the radar ambiguity function, the bandwidth property, the data rate, and the communications receiver complexity.

Title: PeakNetFP: Peak-based Neural Audio Fingerprinting Robust to Extreme Time Stretching
Authors: Guillem Cortès-Sebastià, Benjamin Martin, Emilio Molina, Xavier Serra, Romain Hennequin
Abstract: This work introduces PeakNetFP, the first neural audio fingerprinting (AFP) system designed specifically around spectral peaks. This novel system is designed to leverage the sparse spectral coordinates typically computed by traditional peak-based AFP methods. PeakNetFP performs hierarchical point feature extraction techniques similar to the computer vision model PointNet++, and is trained using contrastive learning like in the state-of-the-art deep learning AFP, NeuralFP. This combination allows PeakNetFP to outperform conventional AFP systems and achieves comparable performance to NeuralFP when handling challenging time-stretched audio data. In extensive evaluation, PeakNetFP maintains a Top-1 hit rate of over 90% for stretching factors ranging from 50% to 200%. Moreover, PeakNetFP offers significant efficiency advantages: compared to NeuralFP, it has 100 times fewer parameters and uses 11 times smaller input data. These features make PeakNetFP a lightweight and efficient solution for AFP tasks where time stretching is involved. Overall, this system represents a promising direction for future AFP technologies, as it successfully merges the lightweight nature of peak-based AFP with the adaptability and pattern recognition capabilities of neural network-based approaches, paving the way for more scalable and efficient solutions in the field.

Title: Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Shallow Transformers for Wireless Symbol Detection
Authors: Li Fan, Peng Wang, Jing Yang, Cong Shen
Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems, particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Title: A Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach for Minority Instrument Detection
Authors: Dylan Sechet, Francesca Bugiotti, Matthieu Kowalski, Edouard d'Hérouville, Filip Langiewicz
Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability. Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for further advancements in this domain.

Title: Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction
Authors: Yuheng Zhang, Mengfei Duan, Kunyu Peng, Yuhang Wang, Ruiping Liu, Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Zhiyong Li, Kailun Yang
Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Prompt-Guided Turn-Taking Prediction
Authors: Koji Inoue, Mikey Elmers, Yahui Fu, Zi Haur Pang, Divesh Lala, Keiko Ochi, Tatsuya Kawahara
Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual prompts.

Title: Unlocking Constraints: Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation
Authors: Yihong Cao, Jiaming Zhang, Xu Zheng, Hao Shi, Kunyu Peng, Hang Liu, Kailun Yang, Hui Zhang
Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models to achieve segmentation with 360° viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and 11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: MedPrompt: LLM-CNN Fusion with Weight Routing for Medical Image Segmentation and Classification
Authors: Shadman Sobhan, Kazi Abrar Mahmud, Abduz Zami
Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of 2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall, MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

Title: Estimation of superconducting cavity bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer
Authors: Bozo Richter, Andrea Bellandi, Julien Branlard, Leon Speidel, Annika Eichler
Abstract: Enabled by progress in superconducting technology, several continuous wave linear accelerators are foreseen in the next decade. For these machines, it is of crucial importance to track the main cavity parameters, such as the resonator bandwidth and detuning. The bandwidth yields information on the superconducting state of the cavity. The detuning should be minimized to limit the required power to operate the cavity. The estimation of these parameters is commonly implemented in the digital electronics of the Low-Level RF control system to minimize the computation delay. In this proceeding, we present a way to compute the bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer. In contrast to previous methods, a state observer yields estimations at the native control system sample rate without explicitly filtering the input signals. Additionally, the error convergence properties of the estimations can be controlled intuitively by adjusting gain parameters. Implementation considerations and test results on the derived observer are presented in the manuscript.

Title: Exact Time-Varying Turnpikes for Dynamic Operation of District Heating Networks
Authors: Max Rose, Hannes Gernandt, Timm Faulwasser, Johannes Schiffer
Abstract: District heating networks (DHNs) are crucial for decarbonizing the heating sector. Yet, their efficient and reliable operation requires the coordination of multiple heat producers and the consideration of future demands. Predictive and optimization-based control is commonly used to address this task, but existing results for DHNs do not account for time-varying problem aspects. Since the turnpike phenomenon can serve as a basis for model predictive control design and analysis, this paper examines its role in DHN optimization by analyzing the underlying optimal control problem with time-varying prices and demands. That is, we derive conditions for the existence of a unique time-varying singular arc, which constitutes the time varying turnpike, and we provide its closed-form expression. Additionally, we present converse turnpike results showing a exact time-varying case implies strict dissipativity of the optimal control problem. A numerical example illustrates our findings.

Title: Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Trajectory Tracking of a Seagoing USV: Design, Simulation, and Field Experiments
Authors: Jelmer van der Saag, Elia Trevisan, Wouter Falkena, Javier Alonso-Mora
Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.

Title: Integrating Vehicle Acoustic Data for Enhanced Urban Traffic Management: A Study on Speed Classification in Suzhou
Authors: Pengfei Fan, Yuli Zhang, Xinheng Wang, Ruiyuan Jiang, Hankang Gu, Dongyao Jia, Shangbo Wang
Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features, which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable urban planning.

Title: Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music. Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.

Title: Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering
Authors: Yizhe Cheng, Chunxun Tian, Haoru Wang, Wentao Zhu, Xiaoxuan Ma, Yizhou Wang
Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Title: Cluster-Aware Two-Stage Method for Fast Iterative MIMO Detection in LEO Satellite Communications
Authors: Jiuyu Liu, Yi Ma, Qihao Peng, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: In this paper, a cluster-aware two-stage multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection method is proposed for direct-to-cell satellite communications. The method achieves computational efficiency by exploiting a distinctive property of satellite MIMO channels: users within the same geographical cluster exhibit highly correlated channel characteristics due to their physical proximity, which typically impedes convergence in conventional iterative MIMO detectors. The proposed method implements a two-stage strategy that first eliminates intra-cluster interference using computationally efficient small matrix inversions, then utilizes these pre-computed matrices to accelerate standard iterative MIMO detectors such as Gauss-Seidel (GS) and symmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) for effective inter-cluster interference cancellation. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more than 12 times faster convergence under perfect channel state information. Even when accounting for channel estimation errors, the method maintains 9 times faster convergence, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness for next-generation satellite MIMO communications.

Title: Plasmonically Enhanced Flexural-Mode AlScN Nanoplate Resonator as Uncooled and Ultrafast IR Detector with High Responsivity
Authors: Aurelio Venditti, Walter Gubinelli, Enise F. Altin, Luca Colombo, Pietro Simeoni, Benyamin Davaji, Matteo Rinaldi
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel class of miniaturized, uncooled, and ultra-fast infrared (IR) resonant thermal detectors (RTDs) based on 30%-doped Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) nanoplates. Exploiting high electromechanical coupling, good thermal properties, and enhanced and selective IR absorption, the presented device aims to demonstrate significant advancements over the state-of-the-art IR RTDs. This single pixel combines compact footprint, high spectral selectivity and responsivity, reduced noise, and fast thermal response, allowing for the potential development of innovative IR thermal imagers through multi-pixel integration. The flexural nature of the actuated resonance mode eventually enables an interferometric optical readout, paving the way towards achieving extremely low Noise Equivalent Power levels. These results demonstrate a high IR responsivity of around 130 ppt/pW, a thermal time constant of around 330 us, and a large out-of-plane displacement. This work represents the first experimental integration on a resonating platform of plasmonic absorbers that utilize AlScN as dielectric layer.

Title: Learnable Adaptive Time-Frequency Representation via Differentiable Short-Time Fourier Transform
Authors: Maxime Leiber, Yosra Marnissi, Axel Barrau, Sylvain Meignen, Laurent Massoulié
Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real-world data.

Title: Towards an Optimal Control Perspective of ResNet Training
Authors: Jens Püttschneider, Simon Heilig, Asja Fischer, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer pruning strategy.

Title: Aligning Spoken Dialogue Models from User Interactions
Authors: Anne Wu, Laurent Mazaré, Neil Zeghidour, Alexandre Défossez
Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions, with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit segmentation between speaker this http URL create a large-scale dataset of more than 150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.

Title: Mathematical Foundation of Sparsity-based Multi-snapshot Spectral Estimation
Authors: Ping Liu, Sanghyeon Yu, Ola Sabet, Lucas Pelkmans, Habib Ammari
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral estimation problem of estimating the locations of a fixed number of point sources given multiple snapshots of Fourier measurements in a bounded domain. We aim to provide a mathematical foundation for sparsity-based super-resolution in such spectral estimation problems in both one- and multi-dimensional spaces. In particular, we estimate the resolution and stability of the location recovery when considering the sparsest solution under the measurement constraint, and characterize their dependence on the cut-off frequency, the noise level, the sparsity of point sources, and the incoherence of the amplitude vectors of point sources. Our estimate emphasizes the importance of the high incoherence of amplitude vectors in enhancing the resolution of multi-snapshot spectral estimation. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it also provides the first stability result in the super-resolution regime for the well-known sparse MMV problem in DOA estimation.

Title: Controller Adaptation via Learning Solutions of Contextual Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Viet-Anh Le, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework for adapting the controller's parameters based on learning optimal solutions from contextual black-box optimization problems. We consider a class of control design problems for dynamical systems operating in different environments or conditions represented by contextual parameters. The overarching goal is to identify the controller parameters that maximize the controlled system's performance, given different realizations of the contextual this http URL formulate a contextual Bayesian optimization problem in which the solution is actively learned using Gaussian processes to approximate the controller adaptation strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework with a sim-to-real example. We learn the optimal weighting strategy of a model predictive control for connected and automated vehicles interacting with human-driven vehicles from simulations and then deploy it in a real-time experiment.

Title: Exploiting Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Massive MIMO Systems Operating Over Non-Stationary Aging Channels
Authors: Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: This work investigates a multi-user, multi-antenna uplink wireless system, in which multiple users transmit signals to a base station. Prior research has explored the potential for linear growth in spectral efficiency by employing multiple transmit and receive antennas. This gain depends heavily on the quality of channel state information and the number of uncorrelated antennas. However, spatial correlations, arising from closely-spaced antennas and channel aging effects -- stemming from the difference between the channel state at pilot and data time instances -- can substantially counteract these benefits, and degrade the transmission rate, especially in non-stationary environments. To address these challenges, this work introduces a real-time beamforming framework to compensate for the spatial correlation and channel aging effects. First, a channel estimation scheme leveraging temporal channel correlations and considering mobile device velocity and antenna spacing is developed. Subsequently, an expression approximating the average spectral efficiency -- which depends on pilot spacing, pilot and data powers, and beamforming vectors -- is obtained. By maximizing this expression, optimal parameters are identified. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to prior works. Interestingly, the optimal pilot spacing remains unaffected by large-scale channel parameters and the velocities of interfering users. The impact of interference components also diminishes with an increasing number of transmit antennas.

Title: Enhancing Dynamic CT Image Reconstruction with Neural Fields and Optical Flow
Authors: Pablo Arratia, Matthias Ehrhardt, Lisa Kreusser
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate image reconstruction for dynamic Computed Tomography. The motion of the target with respect to the measurement acquisition rate leads to highly resolved in time but highly undersampled in space measurements. Such problems pose a major challenge: not accounting for the dynamics of the process leads to a poor reconstruction with non-realistic motion. Variational approaches that penalize time evolution have been proposed to relate subsequent frames and improve image quality based on classical grid-based discretizations. Neural fields have emerged as a novel way to parameterize the quantity of interest using a neural network with a low-dimensional input, benefiting from being lightweight, continuous, and biased towards smooth representations. The latter property has been exploited when solving dynamic inverse problems with neural fields by minimizing a data-fidelity term only. We investigate and show the benefits of introducing explicit motion regularizers for dynamic inverse problems based on partial differential equations, namely, the optical flow equation, for the optimization of neural fields. We compare it against its unregularized counterpart and show the improvements in the reconstruction. We also compare neural fields against a grid-based solver and show that the former outperforms the latter in terms of PSNR in this task.

Title: A Review of Safe Reinforcement Learning Methods for Modern Power Systems
Authors: Tong Su, Tong Wu, Junbo Zhao, Anna Scaglione, Le Xie
Abstract: Given the availability of more comprehensive measurement data in modern power systems, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant interest in operation and control. Conventional RL relies on trial-and-error interactions with the environment and reward feedback, which often leads to exploring unsafe operating regions and executing unsafe actions, especially when deployed in real-world power systems. To address these challenges, safe RL has been proposed to optimize operational objectives while ensuring safety constraints are met, keeping actions and states within safe regions throughout both training and deployment. Rather than relying solely on manually designed penalty terms for unsafe actions, as is common in conventional RL, safe RL methods reviewed here primarily leverage advanced and proactive mechanisms. These include techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation, safety layers, and theoretical guarantees like Lyapunov functions to rigorously enforce safety boundaries. This paper provides a comprehensive review of safe RL methods and their applications across various power system operations and control domains, including security control, real-time operation, operational planning, and emerging areas. It summarizes existing safe RL techniques, evaluates their performance, analyzes suitable deployment scenarios, and examines algorithm benchmarks and application environments. The paper also highlights real-world implementation cases and identifies critical challenges such as scalability in large-scale systems and robustness under uncertainty, providing potential solutions and outlining future directions to advance the reliable integration and deployment of safe RL in modern power systems.

Title: Towards Event-Triggered NMPC for Efficient 6G Communications: Experimental Results and Open Problems
Authors: Jens Püttschneider, Julian Golembiewski, Niklas A. Wagner, Christian Wietfeld, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: Networked control systems enable real-time control and coordination of distributed systems, leveraging the low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity offered by 5G and future 6G networks. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and smart grids. Despite networked control algorithms admitting nominal stability guarantees even in the presence of delays and packet dropouts, their practical performance still heavily depends on the specific characteristics and conditions of the underlying network. To achieve the desired performance while efficiently using communication resources, co-design of control and communication is pivotal. Although periodic schemes, where communication instances are fixed, can provide reliable control performance, unnecessary transmissions, when updates are not needed, result in inefficient usage of network resources. In this paper, we investigate the potential for co-design of model predictive control and network communication. To this end, we design and implement an event-triggered nonlinear model predictive controller for stabilizing a Furuta pendulum communicating over a tailored open radio access network 6G research platform. We analyze the control performance as well as network utilization under varying channel conditions and event-triggering criteria. Additionally, we analyze the network-induced delay pattern and its interaction with the event-triggered controller. Our results show that the event-triggered control scheme achieves similar performance to periodic control with reduced communication demand.

Title: Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks
Authors: Mohamad H. Kazma, Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in water distribution networks (WDNs), with a focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements (SP) that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a greedy algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic systems and observability theory, and yields SPs that are submodular and robust to hydraulic changes. Case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.

Title: Radio Map Estimation via Latent Domain Plug-and-Play Denoising
Authors: Le Xu, Lei Cheng, Junting Chen, Wenqiang Pu, Xiao Fu
Abstract: Radio map estimation (RME), also known as spectrum cartography, aims to reconstruct the strength of radio interference across different domains (e.g., space and frequency) from sparsely sampled measurements. To tackle this typical inverse problem, state-of-the-art RME methods rely on handcrafted or data-driven structural information of radio maps. However, the former often struggles to model complex radio frequency (RF) environments and the latter requires excessive training -- making it hard to quickly adapt to in situ sensing tasks. This work presents a spatio-spectral RME approach based on plug-and-play (PnP) denoising, a technique from computational imaging. The idea is to leverage the observation that the denoising operations of signals like natural images and radio maps are similar -- despite the nontrivial differences of the signals themselves. Hence, sophisticated denoisers designed for or learned from natural images can be directly employed to assist RME, avoiding using radio map data for training. Unlike conventional PnP methods that operate directly in the data domain, the proposed method exploits the underlying physical structure of radio maps and proposes an ADMM algorithm that denoises in a latent domain. This design significantly improves computational efficiency and enhances noise robustness. Theoretical aspects, e.g., recoverability of the complete radio map and convergence of the ADMM algorithm are analyzed. Synthetic and real data experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Context-Aware Doubly-Robust Semi-Supervised Learning
Authors: Clement Ruah, Houssem Sifaou, Osvaldo Simeone, Bashir Al-Hashimi
Abstract: The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in next-generation communication systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of traffic and network conditions, which call for the use of highly contextual, site-specific, data. A promising solution is to rely not only on real-world data, but also on synthetic pseudo-data generated by a network digital twin (NDT). However, the effectiveness of this approach hinges on the accuracy of the NDT, which can vary widely across different contexts. To address this problem, this paper introduces context-aware doubly-robust (CDR) learning, a novel semi-supervised scheme that adapts its reliance on the pseudo-data to the different levels of fidelity of the NDT across contexts. CDR is evaluated on the task of downlink beamforming where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, providing a 24% loss decrease when compared to doubly-robust (DR) semi-supervised learning in regimes with low labeled data availability.

Title: Exploring the Effects of Load Altering Attacks on Load Frequency Control through Python and RTDS
Authors: Michał Forystek, Andrew D. Syrmakesis, Alkistis Kontou, Panos Kotsampopoulos, Nikos D. Hatziargyriou, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.

Title: Aliasing Reduction in Neural Amp Modeling by Smoothing Activations
Authors: Ryota Sato, Julius O. Smith III
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-quality digital emulations of analog audio hardware, such as vintage tube guitar amplifiers, led to numerous works on neural network-based black-box modeling, with deep learning architectures like WaveNet showing promising results. However, a key limitation in all of these models was the aliasing artifacts stemming from nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. In this paper, we investigated novel and modified activation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier models. Supporting this, we introduced a novel metric, the Aliasing-to-Signal Ratio (ASR), which quantitatively assesses the level of aliasing with high accuracy. Measuring also the conventional Error-to-Signal Ratio (ESR), we conducted studies on a range of preexisting and modern activation functions with varying stretch factors. Our findings confirmed that activation functions with smoother curves tend to achieve lower ASR values, indicating a noticeable reduction in aliasing. Notably, this improvement in aliasing reduction was achievable without a substantial increase in ESR, demonstrating the potential for high modeling accuracy with reduced aliasing in neural amp models.

Title: Simultaneous Segmentation of Ventricles and Normal/Abnormal White Matter Hyperintensities in Clinical MRI using Deep Learning
Authors: Mahdi Bashiri Bawil, Mousa Shamsi, Abolhassan Shakeri Bavil
Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and monitoring rely heavily on accurate assessment of brain MRI biomarkers, particularly white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and ventricular changes. Current segmentation approaches suffer from several limitations: they typically segment these structures independently despite their pathophysiological relationship, struggle to differentiate between normal and pathological hyperintensities, and are poorly optimized for anisotropic clinical MRI data. We propose a novel 2D pix2pix-based deep learning framework for simultaneous segmentation of ventricles and WMHs with the unique capability to distinguish between normal periventricular hyperintensities and pathological MS lesions. Our method was developed and validated on FLAIR MRI scans from 300 MS patients. Compared to established methods (SynthSeg, Atlas Matching, BIANCA, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, and WMH-SynthSeg), our approach achieved superior performance for both ventricle segmentation (Dice: 0.801+/-0.025, HD95: 18.46+/-7.1mm) and WMH segmentation (Dice: 0.624+/-0.061, precision: 0.755+/-0.161). Furthermore, our method successfully differentiated between normal and abnormal hyperintensities with a Dice coefficient of 0.647. Notably, our approach demonstrated exceptional computational efficiency, completing end-to-end processing in approximately 4 seconds per case, up to 36 times faster than baseline methods, while maintaining minimal resource requirements. This combination of improved accuracy, clinically relevant differentiation capability, and computational efficiency addresses critical limitations in current neuroimaging analysis, potentially enabling integration into routine clinical workflows and enhancing MS diagnosis and monitoring.

Title: DSA-NRP: No-Reflow Prediction from Angiographic Perfusion Dynamics in Stroke EVT
Authors: Shreeram Athreya, Carlos Olivares, Ameera Ismail, Kambiz Nael, William Speier, Corey Arnold
Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes. Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure, delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI. No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC: 0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331 $\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

Title: Coherent Track-Before-Detect
Authors: Mingchao Liang, Florian Meyer
Abstract: Accurately tracking an unknown and time-varying number of objects in complex environments is a significant challenge but a fundamental capability in a variety of applications, including applied ocean sciences, surveillance, autonomous driving, and wireless communications. Conventional Bayesian multiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT) approach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract measurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can discard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability to resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD) paradigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data. However, existing TBD approaches introduce simplifications to facilitate the development of inference methods, such as assuming known signal amplitudes or conditional independence between sensor measurements given object states. These assumptions can lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting TBD methods in realistic scenarios. This paper introduces coherent TBD based on a comprehensive signal model for sensor data. The new model accounts for sensor data correlations and amplitude fluctuations, enabling the accurate representation of the physics of the data-generating process in TBD. Coherent TBD is suitable for a wide range of problems in active and passive radar, active and passive sonar, as well as integrated sensing and communication systems. Based on a factor graph representation of the new measurement model, a scalable belief propagation (BP) method is developed to perform efficient Bayesian inference. Experimental results, performed with both synthetic and real data, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art conventional MOT methods.

Title: ARSAR-Net: Intelligent SAR Imaging with Adaptive Regularization
Authors: Shiping Fu, Yufan Chen, Zhe Zhang, Xiaolan Qiu, Qixiang Ye
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks have recently emerged as a promising approach for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. However, baseline unfolding networks, typically derived from iterative reconstruction algorithms such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), lack generalization capability across scenes, primarily because their regularizers are empirically designed rather than learned from data. In this study, we introduce a learnable regularizer into the unfolding network and propose a SAR imaging network with adaptive regularization (ARSAR-Net), which aims to generalize across heterogeneous scenes including offshore ships, islands, urban areas, and mountainous terrain. Furthermore, two variants of ARSAR-Net are developed, targeting improved imaging efficiency and reconstruction quality, respectively. Extensive validation through simulated and real-data experiments demonstrates three key advantages of ARSAR-Net: (1) a 50% increase in imaging speed over existing unfolding networks, (2) a PSNR gain of up to 2.0 dB in imaging quality, and (3) enhanced adaptability to complex scenes. These advancements establish a new paradigm for computationally efficient and generalizable SAR imaging systems.

Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.

Title: Rapid Gyroscope Calibration: A Deep Learning Approach
Authors: Yair Stolero, Itzik Klein
Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for the application of gyroscope calibration. We explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 186.6 hours of gyroscope readings, using 36 gyroscopes of four different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The six datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes. Our dataset is publicly available to allow reproducibility of our work and to increase research in the field.

Title: A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Balanced Digraphs
Authors: Feng-Yu Yue, Daniel Zelazo
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.

Title: LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks
Authors: Atonu Ghosh, Sudip Misra
Abstract: Minimal infrastructure requirements make LoRa suitable for service delivery in remote areas. Additionally, web applications have become a de-facto standard for modern service delivery. However, Long Range (LoRa) fails to enable HTTP access due to its limited bandwidth, payload size limitations, and high collisions in multi-user setups. We propose LoRaConnect to enable HTTP access over LoRa. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which client devices connect and access HTTP resources over LoRa backhaul. It implements caching and synchronization mechanisms to address LoRa's aforementioned limitations. It also implements a message-slicing method in the application layer to overcome LoRa's payload limitations. We evaluate the proposed system using actual hardware in three experimental setups to assess the baseline performance, ideal scenario, and practical application scenario with Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). Additionally, it implements a ping operation to demonstrate Internet capability and extensible nature. LoRaWeb achieves an average throughput of 1.18 KB/S approximately, with an access delay of only 1.3 S approximately for a 1.5KB webpage in the baseline setup. Moreover, it achieves an access delay of approximately 6.7 S for a 10KB webpage in the ideal case and an average end-to-end delay of only 612 ms approximately in the FHSS-based setup. Comparison with benchmark suggests multi-fold improvement.

Title: DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection
Authors: Francisco Caetano, Christiaan Viviers, Luis A. Zavala-Mondragón, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.

Title: One Model to Forecast Them All and in Entity Distributions Bind Them
Authors: Kutay Bölat, Simon Tindemans
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster, we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.

Title: Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application
Authors: Xiucheng Wang, Honggang Jia, Nan Cheng, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.

Title: ITO-Master: Inference-Time Optimization for Audio Effects Modeling of Music Mastering Processors
Authors: Junghyun Koo, Marco A. Martinez-Ramirez, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Giorgio Fabbro, Michele Mancusi, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.

Title: TCDiff++: An End-to-end Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion Model for Harmonious Music-Driven Group Choreography
Authors: Yuqin Dai, Wanlu Zhu, Ronghui Li, Xiu Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Jun Li, Jian Yang
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.

Title: IndieFake Dataset: A Benchmark Dataset for Audio Deepfake Detection
Authors: Abhay Kumar, Kunal Verma, Omkar More
Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants, better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment. However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21 (DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF) and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The complete dataset, along with documentation and sample reference clips, is publicly accessible for research use on project website.

Title: Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance
Authors: Xuesong Li, Dianye Huang, Yameng Zhang, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang
Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.
