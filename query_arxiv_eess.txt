Title: WEE-Therapy: A Mixture of Weak Encoders Framework for Psychological Counseling Dialogue Analysis
Authors: Yongqi Kang, Yong Zhao
Abstract: The advancement of computational psychology requires AI tools capable of deeply understanding counseling dialogues. Existing audio language models (AudioLLMs) often rely on single speech encoders pre-trained on general data, struggling to capture domain-specific features like complex emotions and professional techniques. To address this, we propose WEE-Therapy, a multi-task AudioLLM incorporating a Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism. This supplements a powerful base encoder with a pool of lightweight, specialized encoders. A novel dual-routing strategy combines stable, data-independent domain knowledge with dynamic, data-dependent expert selection. Evaluated on emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and summarization, WEE-Therapy achieves significant performance gains across all tasks with minimal parameter overhead, demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted clinical analysis.

Title: SpeechCT-CLIP: Distilling Text-Image Knowledge to Speech for Voice-Native Multimodal CT Analysis
Authors: Lukas Buess, Jan Geier, David Bani-Harouni, Chantal Pellegrini, Matthias Keicher, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Nassir Navab, Andreas Maier, Tomas Arias-Vergara
Abstract: Spoken communication plays a central role in clinical workflows. In radiology, for example, most reports are created through dictation. Yet, nearly all medical AI systems rely exclusively on written text. In this work, we address this gap by exploring the feasibility of learning visual-language representations directly from spoken radiology reports. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale dataset (Speech-RATE) of spoken radiology reports and train SpeechCT-CLIP, a contrastive model that aligns speech and 3D CT volumes in a shared representation space. While naive speech-based models underperform compared to text-trained counterparts, we show that knowledge distillation from a pretrained text-image CLIP model effectively transfers semantic alignment capabilities from text to speech, substantially narrowing this gap. Experiments demonstrate improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705, recovering 88% of the performance difference, and strong retrieval results without requiring text at inference. These findings highlight speech as a practical alternative to text in multimodal pretraining and open the door to voice-driven diagnostic support tools in clinical practice.

Title: An Encoder-Decoder Network for Beamforming over Sparse Large-Scale MIMO Channels
Authors: Yubo Zhang, Jeremy Johnston, Xiaodong Wang
Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.

Title: Precise HDV Positioning through Safety-Aware Integrated Sensing and Communication in a Value-of-Information-Driven 6G V2X System
Authors: Mohammad Reza Abedi, Zahra Rashidi, Nader Mokari, Hamid Saeedi, Nizar Zorba
Abstract: Recent advancements in Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) have unlocked new potential for addressing the dual demands of high-resolution positioning and reliable communication in 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. These capabilities are vital for transmitting safety-critical data from Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to improve metrics such as Time to Collision (TTC) and reduce the Collision Risk (CR) ratio. However, limited radio resources and interference remain major obstacles to achieving both precision and capacity simultaneously. The challenge intensifies in mixedtraffic scenarios involving Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), which lack connectivity and cannot share their status or positioning. Additionally, CAV sensors are limited in range and accuracy, making detection of HDVs unreliable. ISAC plays a pivotal role here by enabling the sensing of HDV positions via shared communication infrastructure, improving environmental awareness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Value of Information (VoI) metric that prioritizes the transmission of safety-critical data. The joint sensing-communication-control problem is modeled as a two-time-scale sequential decision process and solved using a Multi-Agent Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. By focusing on high- VoI data, the framework reduces complexity and optimizes network and traffic resource usage. Simulations show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the CR ratio by at least 33% and improves the TTC by up to 66%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing safety and efficiency in mixedautonomy environments.

Title: Conceptualizing and Modeling Communication-Based Cyberattacks on Automated Vehicles
Authors: Tianyi Li, Tianyu Liu, Yicheng Yang
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is rapidly proliferating across electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, enhancing traffic flow while simultaneously expanding the attack surface for communication-based cyberattacks. Because the two powertrains translate control inputs into motion differently, their cyber-resilience remains unquantified. Therefore, we formalize six novel message-level attack vectors and implement them in a ring-road simulation that systematically varies the ACC market penetration rates (MPRs) and the spatial pattern of compromised vehicles. A three-tier risk taxonomy converts disturbance metrics into actionable defense priorities for practitioners. Across all simulation scenarios, EV platoons exhibit lower velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster post-attack recovery compared to ICE counterparts, revealing an inherent stability advantage. These findings clarify how controller-to-powertrain coupling influences vulnerability and offer quantitative guidance for the detection and mitigation of attacks in mixed automated traffic.

Title: Dynamic Modeling and Control System Analysis for Continuous-Disc Filters in Pulp Mill Operations
Authors: Jose M. Campos-Salazar, Felipe Santander, Sebastian Larrain
Abstract: Vacuum disc filtration is critical in pulp mills for white liquor clarification and pulp washing, involving tightly coupled dynamics between rotational speed, vacuum pressure, slurry concentration, filtrate flow, and cake thickness. These nonlinear interactions are often regulated using empirical methods, lacking formal modeling and control. This article develops a dynamic, multivariable model of a continuous-disc filter (CD-filter) system based on first principles, simplified to a single representative disc for tractability. A linearized state-space model supports the design of two control strategies: a decentralized PI-based scheme and a centralized model predictive control (MPC). MATLAB-Simulink simulations reveal that MPC outperforms PI in tracking accuracy, overshoot reduction, and disturbance rejection. A 3D efficiency surface illustrates the importance of coordinating inlet flow and solids concentration. Results highlight the need for advanced multivariable control in optimizing CD-filter performance.

Title: When Voice Matters: Evidence of Gender Disparity in Positional Bias of SpeechLLMs
Authors: Shree Harsha Bokkahalli Satish, Gustav Eje Henter, Éva Székely
Abstract: The rapid development of SpeechLLM-based conversational AI systems has created a need for robustly benchmarking these efforts, including aspects of fairness and bias. At present, such benchmarks typically rely on multiple choice question answering (MCQA). In this paper, we present the first token-level probabilistic evaluation and response-based study of several issues affecting the use of MCQA in SpeechLLM benchmarking: 1) we examine how model temperature and prompt design affect gender and positional bias on an MCQA gender-bias benchmark; 2) we examine how these biases are affected by the gender of the input voice; and 3) we study to what extent observed trends carry over to a second gender-bias benchmark. Our results show that concerns about positional bias from the text domain are equally valid in the speech domain. We also find the effect to be stronger for female voices than for male voices. To our knowledge, this is the first study to isolate positional bias effects in SpeechLLM-based gender-bias benchmarks. We conclude that current MCQA benchmarks do not account for speech-based bias and alternative strategies are needed to ensure fairness towards all users.

Title: Data-Driven Stochastic Distribution System Hardening Based on Bayesian Online Learning
Authors: Wenlong Shi, Hongyi Li, Zhaoyu Wang
Abstract: Extreme weather frequently cause widespread outages in distribution systems (DSs), demonstrating the importance of hardening strategies for resilience enhancement. However, the well-utilization of real-world outage data with associated weather conditions to make informed hardening decisions in DSs is still an open issue. To bridge this research gap, this paper proposes a data-driven stochastic distribution line (DL) hardening strategy. First, a deep neural network (DNN) regression model is developed to predict the probabilistic evolution of outage scenarios under various hardening decisions. Based on the DNN predictions, the problem is formulated as a decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, accounting for uncertainties in outage scenario distributions using a data-driven ambiguity set. To address decision-dependent uncertainty, a Bayesian online learning algorithm is proposed. This algorithm decomposes the original problem into inner and outer problems. Then, it iteratively refines hardening decisions by sequentially incorporating outage data and dynamically updating decision-specific ambiguity sets by using Bayes' theorem and Bayesian Inference. Also, the convergence of the algorithm is proven through dynamic regret analysis. Finally, case studies are implemented on a real-world DS in Redfield, Iowa, USA. A dataset spanning 24 years (2001-2024) is constructed based on the utility outage records. The simulation results validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Title: Power Distribution System Blackstart Restoration Using Renewable Energy
Authors: Wenlong Shi, Hongyi Li, Cong Bai, Zhaoyu Wang
Abstract: Integrating renewable energy sources into the grid not only reduces global carbon emissions, but also facilitates distribution system (DS) blackstart restoration. This process leverages renewable energy, inverters, situational awareness and distribution automation to initiate blackstart at the DS level, obtaining a fast response and bottom-up restoration. In this Review, we survey the latest technological advances for DS blackstart restoration using renewable energy. We first present mathematical models for distributed energy resources (DERs), network topology, and load dynamics. We then discuss how the situational awareness can help improve restoration performance through real-time monitoring and forecasting. Next, the DS blackstart restoration problem, including objectives, constraints, and existing methodologies for decision-making are provided. Lastly, we outline remaining challenges, and highlight the opportunities and future research directions.

Title: Situationally Aware Rolling Horizon Multi-Tier Load Restoration Considering Behind-The-Meter DER
Authors: Wenlong Shi, Junyuan Zheng, Zhaoyu Wang
Abstract: Restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is well studied, however, most existing research focuses on network partition and microgrid formation, where load transfer is limited to adjacent feeders. This focus is not practical, as when adjacent feeders lack sufficient capacity, utilities may request support from more distant feeders in practice. Such a hirarchical restoration is complex, especially when involving changing system conditions due to cold load pickup and delayed reconnection of behind-the-meter DERs. To fill this research gap, a situationally aware multi-tier load restoration framework is proposed. Specifically, models are proposed to describe the multi-tier load restoration, including the multi-tier load transfer and substation transformer and feeder protection models. By introducing binary actional switching variables and load block transfer variables, the models effectively captures the dynamics of switches and multi-tier transfer process. To integrate situational awareness of evolving system conditions, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and then embedded within a rolling horizon optimization. Particularly, a set of safeguarded constraints are developed based on segment-level restoration reward bounds to mitigate the myopia of traditional rolling horizon optimization. The proposed safeguarded rolling strategy guarantees that each time step is lower bounded by a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of its optimal restoration potential, thereby balancing short-term switching decisions with long-term restoration goals. Finally, cases studies on the modified IEEE 123-node test feeder validate the proposed multi-tier restoration framework.

Title: A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Adversarial Control of Gas Pipeline Operations
Authors: Tejaswini Sanjay Katale, Lu Gao, Yunpeng Zhang, Alaa Senouci
Abstract: Cyberattacks on pipeline operational technology systems pose growing risks to energy infrastructure. This study develops a physics-informed simulation and optimization framework for analyzing cyber-physical threats in petroleum pipeline networks. The model integrates networked hydraulic dynamics, SCADA-based state estimation, model predictive control (MPC), and a bi-level formulation for stealthy false-data injection (FDI) attacks. Pipeline flow and pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.

Title: Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data
Authors: Guy Ohayon, Pierre-Etienne H. Fiquet, Florentin Guth, Jona Ballé, Eero P. Simoncelli
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Title: Multi-Source Position and Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Based on Euclidean Distance Matrices
Authors: Klaus Brümann, Simon Doclo
Abstract: A popular method to estimate the positions or directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple sound sources using an array of microphones is based on steered-response power (SRP) beamforming. For a three-dimensional scenario, SRP-based methods need to jointly optimize three continuous variables for position estimation or two continuous variables for DOA estimation, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose novel methods for multi-source position and DOA estimation by exploiting properties of Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) and their respective Gram matrices. In the proposed multi-source position estimation method only a single continuous variable, representing the distance between each source and a reference microphone, needs to be optimized. For each source, the optimal continuous distance variable and set of candidate time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates are determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. The estimated relative source positions are then mapped to estimated absolute source positions by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem for each source. The proposed multi-source DOA estimation method entirely eliminates the need for continuous variable optimization by defining a relative coordinate system per source such that one of its coordinate axes is aligned with the respective source DOA. The optimal set of candidate TDOA estimates is determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of a rank-reduced Gram matrix. The computational cost of the proposed EDM-based methods is significantly reduced compared to the SRP-based methods. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations show that the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the SRP-based method in terms of two-source position and DOA estimation accuracy.

Title: Guaranteed Time Control using Linear Matrix Inequalities
Authors: Víctor Costa da Silva Campos, Mariella Maia Quadros, Luciano Frezzato, Leonardo Mozelli, Anh-Tu Nguyen
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis approach aiming to guarantee a minimum upper-bound for the time taken to reach a target set of non-zero measure that encompasses the origin, while taking into account uncertainties and input and state constraints. This approach is based on a harmonic transformation of the Lyapunov function and a novel piecewise quadratic representation of this transformed Lyapunov function over a simplicial partition of the state space. The problem is solved in a policy iteration fashion, whereas the evaluation and improvement steps are formulated as linear matrix inequalities employing the structural relaxation approach. Though initially formulated for uncertain polytopic systems, extensions to piecewise and nonlinear systems are discussed. Three examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios.

Title: Rate-Adaptive Semantic Communication via Multi-Stage Vector Quantization
Authors: Jinsung Park, Junyong Shin, Yongjeong Oh, Jihun Park, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for rate-adaptive semantic communication based on multi-stage vector quantization (VQ), termed \textit{MSVQ-SC}. Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require exponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed framework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and dynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design enables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while mitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To optimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes task loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental allocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating entropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing communication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while providing flexible and fine-grained rate control.

Title: STSM-FiLM: A FiLM-Conditioned Neural Architecture for Time-Scale Modification of Speech
Authors: Dyah A. M. G. Wisnu, Ryandhimas E. Zezario, Stefano Rini, Fo-Rui Li, Yan-Tsung Peng, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Time-Scale Modification (TSM) of speech aims to alter the playback rate of audio without changing its pitch. While classical methods like Waveform Similarity-based Overlap-Add (WSOLA) provide strong baselines, they often introduce artifacts under non-stationary or extreme stretching conditions. We propose STSM-FILM - a fully neural architecture that incorporates Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to condition the model on a continuous speed factor. By supervising the network using WSOLA-generated outputs, STSM-FILM learns to mimic alignment and synthesis behaviors while benefiting from representations learned through deep learning. We explore four encoder--decoder variants: STFT-HiFiGAN, WavLM-HiFiGAN, Whisper-HiFiGAN, and EnCodec, and demonstrate that STSM-FILM is capable of producing perceptually consistent outputs across a wide range of time-scaling factors. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of FiLM-based conditioning to improve the generalization and flexibility of neural TSM models.

Title: High Pixel Resolution Visible to Extended Shortwave Infrared Single Pixel Imaging with a black Phosphorus-Molybdenum disulfide (bP-MoS2) photodiode
Authors: Seyed Saleh Mousavi Khaleghi, Jinyuan Chen, Sivacarendran Balendhran, Alexander Corletto, Shifan Wang, Huan Liu, James Bullock, Kenneth B. Crozier
Abstract: High-resolution infrared imagers are currently more expensive than CMOS and CCD cameras, due to costly sensor arrays. Van der Waals (vdWs) materials present an opportunity for low-cost, room temperature infrared photodetectors. Although photodetectors based on vdWs materials show promising performance, creating a megapixel array is yet to be achieved. Imaging with a single vdWs photodetector typically relies on time-consuming mechanical scanning and suffers from low resolution. Single pixel imaging (SPI) offers an affordable alternative to achieve high-resolution imaging, utilizing only one photodetector and a spatial light modulator. Progress in SPI using vdWs material photodetectors has been limited, with only one prior demonstration in the near infrared range (64$\times$64 pixels). In this work, we demonstrate a high-resolution SPI system (1023$\times$768 for visible light and 512$\times$512 for extended shortwave infrared) using a black phosphorus-molybdenum disulfide (bP-MoS$_2$) photodiode, surpassing earlier vdWs material SPI implementations by a factor of 64 in pixel count. We introduce an easy-to-implement edge detection method for rapid feature extraction. We employ compressed sampling and reduce imaging time by a factor of four. Our compressed sampling approach is based on a cyclic S-matrix, which is derived from a Hadamard-based sequence, where each row is a circular shift of the first row. This enables efficient imaging reconstruction via circular convolution and Fourier transforms, allowing fewer measurements while preserving the key image features. Our method for SPI using a vdWs material photodetector presents the opportunity for inexpensive shortwave infrared and midwave infrared cameras, and thus may enable advances in gas detection, biomedical imaging, autonomous driving, security, and surveillance.

Title: Mutual Information-Driven Visualization and Clustering for Core KPI Selection in O-RAN Testing
Authors: Anish Pradhan, Lingjia Liu, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex, with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information (DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core'' performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics, organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN testing.

Title: A UAV-Based VNIR Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset for Landmine and UXO Detection
Authors: Sagar Lekhak, Emmett J. Ientilucci, Jasper Baur, Susmita Ghosh
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic induction (EMI) data from the same test field.

Title: Image Enhancement Based on Pigment Representation
Authors: Se-Ho Lee, Keunsoo Ko, Seung-Wook Kim
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low computational complexity and small model size.

Title: A Control-Barrier-Function-Based Algorithm for Policy Adaptation in Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Zehui Lu, Nicolas Miguel, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adapting a predesigned policy, represented by a parameterized function class, from a solution that minimizes a given original cost function to a trade-off solution between minimizing the original objective and an additional cost function. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where deviations from the optimal value of the original cost are explicitly constrained. To solve it, we develop a closed-loop system that governs the evolution of the policy parameters, with a closed-loop controller designed to adjust the additional cost gradient to ensure the satisfaction of the constraint. The resulting closed-loop system, termed control-barrier-function-based policy adaptation, exploits the set-invariance property of control barrier functions to guarantee constraint satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on the Cartpole and Lunar Lander benchmarks from OpenAI Gym, as well as a quadruped robot, thereby illustrating both its practicality and potential for real-world policy adaptation.

Title: Denoising and Augmentation: A Dual Use of Diffusion Model for Enhanced CSI Recovery
Authors: Yupeng Li, Ruhao Zhang, Yitong Liu, Chunju Shao, Jing Jin, Shijian Gao
Abstract: This letter introduces a dual application of denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based channel estimation algorithm integrating data denoising and augmentation. Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals at pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An unsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge of pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the data-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state information (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by adjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward strategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level simulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.

Title: Periodic Event-Triggered Prescribed Time Control of Euler-Lagrange Systems under State and Input Constraints
Authors: Chidre Shravista Kashyap, Karnan A, Pushpak Jagtap, Jishnu Keshavan
Abstract: This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour. Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control scheme.

Title: GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction
Authors: Daeyoung Kim
Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches, deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

Title: Neyman Pearson Detector for Multiple Ambient Backscatter Zero-Energy-Devices Beacons using Near-Perfect Code
Authors: Shanglin Yang, Jean-Marie Gorce, Muhammad Jehangir Khan, Dinh-Thuy Phan-Huy, Guillaume Villemaud
Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low-power indoor localization system based on Zero-Energy Devices (ZEDs) has shown promising results in ambient backscatter communication. In this paper, we study detection of multiple coexisting ZEDs in ambient backscatter systems under interference and synchronization uncertainty. Building on a Neyman-Pearson (NP) formulation previously applied to single-tag detection, we introduce a detector tailored to multi-tag scenarios. The core idea is to use a Near-Perfect Code (NPC) as the synchronization sequence, which substantially improves the peak-to-sidelobe (PSL) ratio and thus separability among concurrent tags. The proposed scheme replaces dual band-pass filtering with dual correlators, enabling an explicit Bayesian detector and tight control of the false-alarm rate; we further incorporate a contrast metric and multi-frequency combining to reveal secondary tags. Experiments on the CorteXlab testbed (part of the SLICES-EU infrastructure) confirm robustness at low SNR, with observed PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB. These results advance scalable, reliable ambient backscatter localization in practical multi-tag environments.

Title: Pioneering Scalable Prototyping for Mid-Band XL-MIMO Systems: Design and Implementation
Authors: Jiachen Tian, Yu Han, Zhengtao Jin, Xi Yang, Jie Yang, Wankai Tang, Xiao Li, Wenjin Wang, Shi Jin
Abstract: The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is emerging as a key enabler for future communication systems. Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems, the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems, posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements, and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12 users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of 15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80 bit/s/Hz.

Authors: Chunbo Hao, Ruibin Yuan, Jixun Yao, Qixin Deng, Xinyi Bai, Wei Xue, Lei Xie
Abstract: Music structure analysis (MSA) underpins music understanding and controllable generation, yet progress has been limited by small, inconsistent corpora. We present SongFormer, a scalable framework that learns from heterogeneous supervision. SongFormer (i) fuses short- and long-window self-supervised audio representations to capture both fine-grained and long-range dependencies, and (ii) introduces a learned source embedding to enable training with partial, noisy, and schema-mismatched labels. To support scaling and fair evaluation, we release SongFormDB, the largest MSA corpus to date (over 10k tracks spanning languages and genres), and SongFormBench, a 300-song expert-verified benchmark. On SongFormBench, SongFormer sets a new state of the art in strict boundary detection (HR.5F) and achieves the highest functional label accuracy, while remaining computationally efficient; it surpasses strong baselines and Gemini 2.5 Pro on these metrics and remains competitive under relaxed tolerance (HR3F). Code, datasets, and model are publicly available.

Title: Enhancing Photogrammetry Reconstruction For HRTF Synthesis Via A Graph Neural Network
Authors: Ludovic Pirard, Katarina C. Poole, Lorenzo Picinali
Abstract: Traditional Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) acquisition methods rely on specialised equipment and acoustic expertise, posing accessibility challenges. Alternatively, high-resolution 3D modelling offers a pathway to numerically synthesise HRTFs using Boundary Elements Methods and others. However, the high cost and limited availability of advanced 3D scanners restrict their applicability. Photogrammetry has been proposed as a solution for generating 3D head meshes, though its resolution limitations restrict its application for HRTF synthesis. To address these limitations, this study investigates the feasibility of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) using neural subdivision techniques for upsampling low-resolution Photogrammetry-Reconstructed (PR) meshes into high-resolution meshes, which can then be employed to synthesise individual HRTFs. Photogrammetry data from the SONICOM dataset are processed using Apple Photogrammetry API to reconstruct low-resolution head meshes. The dataset of paired low- and high-resolution meshes is then used to train a GNN to upscale low-resolution inputs to high-resolution outputs, using a Hausdorff Distance-based loss function. The GNN's performance on unseen photogrammetry data is validated geometrically and through synthesised HRTFs generated via Mesh2HRTF. Synthesised HRTFs are evaluated against those computed from high-resolution 3D scans, to acoustically measured HRTFs, and to the KEMAR HRTF using perceptually-relevant numerical analyses as well as behavioural experiments, including localisation and Spatial Release from Masking (SRM) tasks.

Title: Life Estimation of HVDC Cable Insulation under Load Cycles: from Macroscopic to Microscopic Charge Conduction Modelling
Authors: Bassel Diban, Giovanni Mazzanti
Abstract: This paper goes one step forward in the life estimation of HVDC cable insulation under load cycles by introducing for the first time a microscopic model of charge conduction and transport i.e., Bipolar Charge Transport BCT model for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that found in literature. Then, the parameters of the developed BCT model are optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic PEA space charge measurements. Followed by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure 852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models already found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable electric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior of the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling load cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different amplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This investigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research project.

Title: Delay-Tolerant Augmented-Consensus-based Distributed Directed Optimization
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Narahari Kasagatta Ramesh, Alireza Aghasi
Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning, data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.

Title: Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized Linear-Quadratic Control with multiplicative noise
Authors: Gabriel Diaz, Lucky Li, Wenhao Zhang
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

Title: Incomplete Air Mixing Reduces the Efficiency of Commercial Buildings Behaving as Virtual Batteries
Authors: Austin J. Lin, Jacques A. de Chalendar, Johanna L. Mathieu
Abstract: Commercial building Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems can provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Some researchers have found it convenient to model HVAC systems as virtual batteries. These models also better align with models used by grid planners and operators. However, experiments have shown that HVAC load shifting can be inefficient, and virtual battery models do not capture this inefficiency well. While the models typically use the average room temperature as the system's ``state of charge," they do not capture other factors that affect HVAC power/energy such as airflow and mixing. Here, we develop a new analytical building model to explore how incomplete mixing of supply air into a conditioned space leads to inefficiency in a virtual battery capturing the dynamics of HVAC fan power load shifting. The model qualitatively matches experimental results better than previous models, and shows that, as mixing becomes worse, the virtual battery becomes less efficient. Unfortunately, air mixing is unmeasured/unmeasurable. However, we show that, by closing the loop around measurements of fan power, we can improve the virtual battery's performance without the need for air mixing measurements. For example, in one case, we show a roundtrip efficiency improvement from 0.75 to 0.99.

Title: Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Positioning in Cellular Vehicular Networks
Authors: Xin Tong, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yuzhi Yang, Yu Ge, Zhaohui Yang, Henk Wymeersch, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: In this correspondence, a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed to accomplish data communication, vehicle positioning, and environment sensing simultaneously in a cellular vehicular network. By incorporating the vehicle positioning problem with the existing computational-imaging-based ISAC models, we formulate a special integrated sensing, communication, and positioning problem in which the unknowns are highly coupled. To mitigate the rank deficiency and make it solvable, we discretize the region of interest (ROI) into sensing and positioning pixels respectively, and exploit both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation of the vehicles' uplink access signals. The resultant problem is shown to be a polynomial bilinear compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction problem, which is then solved by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to iteratively achieve symbol detection, vehicle positioning and environment sensing. Performance analysis and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Towards Electrophysiological and Histological Mapping of Upper Limb Nerves in Pigs Using Epineural Stimulation
Authors: Jonathan Baum (CAMIN), Chamot-Nonin Manon, Oppelt Vera, David Guiraud, Christine Azevedo Coste (CAMIN), Thomas Guiho (CAMIN)
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic applications.

Title: Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Multi-Microgrids: Improved Double Auction Mechanism and Prediction-Free Online Trading Approach
Authors: Kaidi Huang, Lin Cheng, Yue Zhou, Fashun Shi, Yufei Xi, Yingrui Zhuang, Ning Qi
Abstract: Peer-to-peer energy trading offers a promising solution for enhancing renewable energy utilization and economic benefits within interconnected microgrids. However, existing real-time P2P markets face two key challenges: high computational complexity in trading mechanisms, and suboptimal participant decision-making under diverse uncertainties. Existing prediction-based decision-making methods rely heavily on accurate forecasts, which are typically unavailable for microgrids, while prediction-free methods suffer from myopic behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved double auction mechanism combined with an adaptive step-size search algorithm to reduce computational burden, and a data-driven dual-reference online optimization (DDOO) framework to enhance participant decision-making. The improved mechanism simplifies bidding procedures, significantly reducing computational burden and ensuring rapid convergence to the market equilibrium. Additionally, the prediction-free DDOO framework mitigates myopic decision-making by introducing two informative reference signals. Case studies on a 20-microgrid system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed mechanism and approach. The improved mechanism significantly decreases the computational time while increasing local energy self-sufficiency periods from 0.01% to 29.86%, reducing reverse power flow periods from 24.51% to 3.96%, and lowering average operating costs by 19.20%. Compared with conventional approaches such as Lyapunov optimization and model predictive control, the DDOO framework achieves a 10%-13% reduction in operating costs with an optimality gap of only 5.76%.

Title: Physics-Constrained Inc-GAN for Tunnel Propagation Modeling from Sparse Line Measurements
Authors: Yang Zhou, Haochang Wu, Yunxi Mu, Hao Qin, Xinyue Zhang, Xingqi Zhang
Abstract: High-speed railway tunnel communication systems require reliable radio wave propagation prediction to ensure operational safety. However, conventional simulation methods face challenges of high computational complexity and inability to effectively process sparse measurement data collected during actual railway operations. This letter proposes an inception-enhanced generative adversarial network (Inc-GAN) that can reconstruct complete electric field distributions across tunnel cross-sections using sparse value lines measured during actual train operations as input. This directly addresses practical railway measurement constraints. Through an inception-based generator architecture and progressive training strategy, the method achieves robust reconstruction from single measurement signal lines to complete field distributions. Numerical simulation validation demonstrates that Inc-GAN can accurately predict electric fields based on measured data collected during actual train operations, with significantly improved computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, providing a novel solution for railway communication system optimization based on real operational data.

Title: CVSM: Contrastive Vocal Similarity Modeling
Authors: Christos Garoufis, Athanasia Zlatintsi, Petros Maragos
Abstract: The availability of large, unlabeled datasets across various domains has contributed to the development of a plethora of methods that learn representations for multiple target (downstream) tasks through self-supervised pre-training. In this work, we introduce CVSM (Contrastive Vocal Similarity Modeling), a contrastive self-supervised procedure for music signal representation learning in the audio domain that can be utilized for musical and vocal similarity modeling. Our method operates under a contrastive framework, maximizing the similarity between vocal excerpts and musical mixtures containing the same vocals; we devise both a label-informed protocol, leveraging artist identity information to sample the contrastive pairs, and a label-agnostic scheme, involving artificial mixture creation from randomly sampled vocal and accompaniment excerpts, which are paired with vocals from the same audio segment. We evaluate our proposed method in measuring vocal similarity both objectively, through linear probing on a suite of appropriate downstream tasks, and subjectively, via conducting a user study consisting of pairwise comparisons between different models in a recommendation-by-query setting. Our results indicate that the representations learned through CVSM are effective in musical and vocal similarity modeling, outperforming numerous baselines across both isolated vocals and complete musical mixtures. Moreover, while the availability of artist identity labels during pre-training leads to overall more consistent performance both in the evaluated downstream tasks and the user study, a label-agnostic CVSM variant incorporating hybrid pre-training with real and artificial mixtures achieves comparable performance to the label-informed one in artist identification and perceived vocal similarity.

Title: Economic zone data-enabled predictive control for connected open water systems
Authors: Xiaoqiao Chen, Xuewen Zhang, Minghao Han, Adrian Wing-Keung Law, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: Real-time regulation of water distribution in connected open water systems is critical for ensuring system safety and meeting operational requirements. In this work, we consider a connected open water system that includes linkage hydraulic structures such as weirs, pumps and sluice gates. We propose a mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach, which is used to maintain the water levels of the branches within desired zones to avoid floods and reduce the energy consumption of the pumps in the considered water system. The proposed DeePC-based approach predicts the future dynamics of the system water levels, and generates optimal control actions based on system input and output data, thereby eliminating the need for both first-principles modeling and explicit data-driven modeling. To achieve multiple control objectives in order of priority, we utilize lexicographic optimization and adapt traditional DeePC cost function for zone tracking and energy consumption minimization. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is utilized to determine the control target zone, which effectively balances zone tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water levels within the desired zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 h. Compared to baseline methods, the proposed approach reduces the zone-tracking mean square error by 98.82% relative to economic zone DeePC without Bayesian optimization, and lowers energy consumption by 44.08% relative to economic set-point tracking DeePC. As compared to passive pump/gate control, the proposed method lowers the frequency of zone violations by 86.94% and the average energy consumption by 4.69%.

Title: Compressed Multiband Sensing in FR3 Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
Authors: Dexin Wang, Isha Jariwala, Ahmad Bazzi, Sundeep Rangan, Theodore S. Rappaport, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel framework for multiband sensing using uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols. To solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization. Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability (SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay root mean squared error of 35% and 38.1%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz) for 6G systems.

Title: A Study of Neural Polar Decoders for Communication
Authors: Rom Hirsch, Ziv Aharoni, Henry D. Pfister, Haim H. Permuter
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements, the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics, resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the 5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

Title: Eigenvalue Tracking of Large-Scale Systems Impacted by Time Delays
Authors: Andreas Bouterakos, Georgios Tzounas
Abstract: The paper focuses on tracking eigenvalue trajectories in power system models with time delays. We formulate a continuation-based approach that employs numerical integration to follow eigenvalues as system parameters vary, in the presence of one or multiple delayed variables. The formulation preserves the sparsity of the delay differential-algebraic equation (DDAE) system model and allows treating the delay magnitude itself as a varying parameter with implementation aspects discussed in detail. Accuracy is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system with distributed energy resources. Scalability is discussed using a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission network.

Title: A Dimension-Decomposed Learning Framework for Online Disturbance Identification in Quadrotor SE(3) Control
Authors: Tianhua Gao
Abstract: Quadrotor stability under complex dynamic disturbances and model uncertainties poses significant challenges. One of them remains the underfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the identification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from which we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for geometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (``slices"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation (PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we prove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to exponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and specific knowledge of the model.

Title: Evaluation of preprocessing pipelines in the creation of in-the-wild TTS datasets
Authors: Matías Di Bernardo, Emmanuel Misley, Ignacio Correa, Mateo García Iacovelli, Simón Mellino, Gala Lucía Gonzalez Barrios
Abstract: This work introduces a reproducible, metric-driven methodology to evaluate preprocessing pipelines for in-the-wild TTS corpora generation. We apply a custom low-cost pipeline to the first in-the-wild Argentine Spanish collection and compare 24 pipeline configurations combining different denoising and quality filtering variants. Evaluation relies on complementary objective measures (PESQ, SI-SDR, SNR), acoustic descriptors (T30, C50), and speech-preservation metrics (F0-STD, MCD). Results expose trade-offs between dataset size, signal quality, and voice preservation; where denoising variants with permissive filtering provide the best overall compromise for our testbed. The proposed methodology allows selecting pipeline configurations without training TTS models for each subset, accelerating and reducing the cost of preprocessing development for low-resource settings.

Title: Wave-GMS: Lightweight Multi-Scale Generative Model for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Talha Ahmed, Nehal Ahmed Shaikh, Hassan Mohy-ud-Din
Abstract: For equitable deployment of AI tools in hospitals and healthcare facilities, we need Deep Segmentation Networks that offer high performance and can be trained on cost-effective GPUs with limited memory and large batch sizes. In this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale generative model for medical image segmentation. Wave-GMS has a substantially smaller number of trainable parameters, does not require loading memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models, and supports training with large batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory. We conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument, and HAM10000), demonstrating that Wave-GMS achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters.

Title: KAME: Tandem Architecture for Enhancing Knowledge in Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Conversational AI
Authors: So Kuroki, Yotaro Kubo, Takuya Akiba, Yujin Tang
Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural, low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency, which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency on par with the baseline.

Title: Accelerated Convolutive Transfer Function-Based Multichannel NMF Using Iterative Source Steering
Authors: Xuemai Xie, Xianrui Wang, Liyuan Zhang, Yichen Yang, Shoji Makino
Abstract: Among numerous blind source separation (BSS) methods, convolutive transfer function-based multichannel non-negative matrix factorization (CTF-MNMF) has demonstrated strong performance in highly reverberant environments by modeling multi-frame correlations of delayed source signals. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the high computational cost associated with the iterative projection (IP) update rule, which requires matrix inversion for each source. To address this issue, we propose an efficient variant of CTF-MNMF that integrates iterative source steering (ISS), a matrix inversion-free update rule for separation filters. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior separation performance to the original CTF-MNMF, while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Title: Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest distillation model
Authors: Zilai Li
Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8 steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO 2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and 17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61, respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps, whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation algorithm.

Title: Linear RNNs for autoregressive generation of long music samples
Authors: Konrad Szewczyk, Daniel Gallo Fernández, James Townsend
Abstract: Directly learning to generate audio waveforms in an autoregressive manner is a challenging task, due to the length of the raw sequences and the existence of important structure on many different timescales. Traditional approaches based on recurrent neural networks, as well as causal convolutions and self-attention, have only had limited success on this task. However, recent work has shown that deep state space models, also referred to as linear RNNs, can be highly efficient in this context. In this work, we push the boundaries of linear RNNs applied to raw audio modeling, investigating the effects of different architectural choices and using context-parallelism to enable training on sequences up to one minute (1M tokens) in length. We present a model, HarmonicRNN, which attains state of the art log-likelihoods and perceptual metrics on small-scale datasets.

Title: Improved Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Control of Time-Varying Systems by Bounded Extremum Seeking
Authors: Shaifalee Saxena, Alan Williams, Rafael Fierro, Alexander Scheinker
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Title: Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization using Markov chain Monte Carlo
Authors: Jannik Graebner, Ryne Beeson
Abstract: Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.

Title: Bridging the Prediction Error Method and Subspace Identification: A Weighted Null Space Fitting Method
Authors: Jiabao He, S. Joe Qin, Håkan Hjalmarsson
Abstract: Subspace identification methods (SIMs) have proven to be very useful and numerically robust for building state-space models. While most SIMs are consistent, few if any can achieve the efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). Conversely, the prediction error method (PEM) with a quadratic criteria is equivalent to MLE, but it comes with non-convex optimization problems and requires good initialization points. This contribution proposes a weighted null space fitting (WNSF) approach for estimating state-space models, combining some key advantages of the two aforementioned mainstream approaches. It starts with a least-squares estimate of a high-order ARX model, and then a multi-step least-squares procedure reduces the model to a state-space model on canoncial form. It is demonstrated through statistical analysis that when a canonical parameterization is admissible, the proposed method is consistent and asymptotically efficient, thereby making progress on the long-standing open problem about the existence of an asymptotically efficient SIM. Numerical and practical examples are provided to illustrate that the proposed method performs favorable in comparison with SIMs.

Title: Efficient Optimal Path Planning in Dynamic Environments Using Koopman MPC
Authors: Mohammad Abtahi, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space. Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to linear problems.

Title: Anti-Jamming Modulation for OFDM Systems under Jamming Attacks
Authors: Jaewon Yun, Joohyuk Park, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers, enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver, we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the proposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method. Simulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed anti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks across a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios.

Authors: Chinthana Wimalasuriya, Spyros Tragoudas
Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy. In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical for real-world applications.

Title: FSMA: Scalable and Reliable LoRa for Non-Terrestrial Networks with Mobile Gateways
Authors: Rohith Reddy Vennam, Maiyun Zhang, Raghav Subbaraman, Deepak Vashist, Dinesh Bharadia
Abstract: The proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for universal IoT applications and the growing use of drones in emergency services, agriculture, and military operations highlight the transformative potential of non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, these networks face two key challenges: (1) large coverage footprints that create frequent collisions and (2) moving gateways that cause dynamic links and demand synchronization-free, link-aware transmissions. Existing random access schemes such as ALOHA, CSMA, and BSMA fail in this setting, suffering from high collision rates, hidden terminals, or excessive gateway energy overhead. We propose Free Signal Multiple Access (FSMA), a gateway-controlled protocol that introduces a lightweight free signal chirp (FreeChirp). FreeChirp ensures that nodes transmit only when the channel is idle and when links are reliable, thereby reducing collisions and enabling link-aware access without the need for synchronization or complex scheduling. We evaluate FSMA using 25 commercial LoRa devices with a drone-mounted moving gateway and demonstrate up to 2x higher throughput, 2x to 5x better packet reception ratio, and 5x improved energy efficiency compared to the baselines. Large-scale simulations with a custom Satellite IoT Simulator further show that FSMA scales to 5000+ devices per satellite pass. These results establish FSMA as a practical step toward scalable, energy-efficient, and reliable NTN IoT networks.

Title: Assist-as-needed Control for FES in Foot Drop Management
Authors: Andreas Christou, Elliot Lister, Georgia Andreopoulou, Don Mahad, Sethu Vijayakumar
Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance, providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions, including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and adherence.

Title: WavInWav: Time-domain Speech Hiding via Invertible Neural Network
Authors: Wei Fan, Kejiang Chen, Xiangkun Wang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu
Abstract: Data hiding is essential for secure communication across digital media, and recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide enhanced methods for embedding secret information effectively. However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.

Title: Single-Rod Brachiation Robot: Mechatronic Control Design and Validation of Prejump Phases
Authors: Juraj Lieskovský, Hijiri Akahane, Aoto Osawa, Jaroslav Bušek, Ikuo Mizuuchi, Tomáš Vyhlídal
Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system, and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are experimentally validated.

Title: Corrosion Risk Estimation for Heritage Preservation: An Internet of Things and Machine Learning Approach Using Temperature and Humidity
Authors: Reginald Juan M. Mercado, Muhammad Kabeer, Haider Al-Obaidy, Rosdiadee Nordin
Abstract: Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks

Title: Distributed Feedback-Feedforward Algorithms for Time-Varying Resource Allocation
Authors: Yiqiao Xu, Tengyang Gong, Zhengtao Ding, Alessandra Parisio
Abstract: This paper studies distributed Time-Varying Resource Allocation (TVRA) where the local cost functions, global equality constraints, and Local Feasibility Constraints (LFCs) vary with time. Algorithms that mimic the structure of feedback-feedforward control systems are proposed. Feedback and feedforward laws are generated using local estimates from a distributed estimator, while a distributed controller enforces the stationarity condition within a fixed time and updates the candidate solution accordingly. To handle the LFCs, feedback laws based on projection and feedforward laws that switch between different modes are introduced as an initialization-free alternative to the barrier-based methods used in most related works. Our projection-based method guarantees that, for any infeasible initial value, the state trajectory enters the locally feasible set within a fixed time and remains within it thereafter, and that the set is forward invariant if the initial value is locally feasible. Convergence analyses are conducted under mild assumptions. For cases without LFCs, the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time. For cases with LFCs, the proposed algorithm is globally asymptotically stable at the optimal trajectory while exhibiting fixed-time convergence between consecutive switching instants. Numerical examples and a power system application verify their effectiveness.

Title: Distributed Koopman Learning with Incomplete Measurements
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Lili Wang, Ayush Rai, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has emerged as a powerful tool for system identification, particularly for approximating nonlinear time-invariant systems (NTIS). This paper considers a network of agents with limited observation capabilities that collaboratively estimate the dynamics of an NTIS. A distributed deep Koopman learning algorithm is developed by integrating Koopman operator theory, deep neural networks, and consensus-based coordination. In the proposed framework, each agent approximates the system dynamics using its partial measurements and lifted states exchanged with its neighbors. This cooperative scheme enables accurate reconstruction of the global dynamics despite the absence of full-state information at individual agents. Simulation results on the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to the centralized deep Koopman learning with full-state access.

Title: Privacy-Aware Design of Distributed MIMO ISAC Systems
Authors: Henrik Åkesson, Marco Gomes, Diana Pamela Moya Osorio
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems raise unprecedented challenges regarding security and privacy since related applications involve the gathering of sensitive, identifiable information about people and the environment, which can lead to privacy leakage. Privacy-aware measures can steer the design of ISAC systems to prevent privacy violations. Thus, we explore this perspective for the design of distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output ISAC systems. For this purpose, we introduce an adversarial model where a malicious user exploits the interference from ISAC signals to extract sensing information. To mitigate this threat, we propose an iterative privacy-aware framework of two blocks: precoder design and access point selection. The precoder design aims to minimize the mutual information between the sensing and communication signals by imposing constraints on sensing and communication performance and maximum transmit power. The access point selection also aims to minimize the mutual information between communication and sensing signals by strategically selecting access points that transmit ISAC signals, and sensing receivers. Results show a reduction in the effectiveness of the attack measured by the probability of detection of the attacker.

Title: Distributed Koopman Learning using Partial Trajectories for Control
Authors: Wenjian Hao, Zehui Lu, Devesh Upadhyay, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework for dynamics learning, termed distributed deep Koopman learning using partial trajectories (DDKL-PT). In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.

Title: Future pathways for eVTOLs: A design optimization perspective
Authors: Johannes Janning, Sophie F. Armanini, Urban Fasel
Abstract: The rapid development of advanced urban air mobility, particularly electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, requires interdisciplinary approaches involving the future urban air mobility ecosystem. Operational cost efficiency, regulatory aspects, sustainability, and environmental compatibility should be incorporated directly into the conceptual design of aircraft and across operational and regulatory strategies. In this work, we apply a novel multidisciplinary design optimization framework for the conceptual design of eVTOL aircraft. The framework optimizes conventional design elements of eVTOL aircraft over a generic mission and integrates a comprehensive operational cost model to directly capture economic incentives of the designed system through profit modeling for operators. We introduce a novel metric, the cross-transportation Figure of Merit (FoM), to compare the optimized eVTOL system with various competing road, rail, and air transportation modes in terms of sustainability, cost, and travel time. We investigate four objective-specific eVTOL optimization designs in a broad scenario space, mapping regulatory, technical, and operational constraints to generate a representation of potential urban air mobility stakeholder-centric design objectives. The analysis of an optimized profit-maximizing eVTOL, cost-minimizing eVTOL, sustainability-maximizing eVTOL, and a combined FoM-maximizing eVTOL design highlights significant trade-offs in the area of profitability, operational flexibility, and sustainability strategies. This underlines the importance of incorporating multiple operationally tangential disciplines into the design process, while also reflecting the diverse priorities of stakeholders such as operators, regulators, and society.

Title: WaveNet-SF: A Hybrid Network for Retinal Disease Detection Based on Wavelet Transform in Spatial-Frequency Domain
Authors: Jilan Cheng, Guoli Long, Zeyu Zhang, Zhenjia Qi, Hanyu Wang, Libin Lu, Shuihua Wang, Yudong Zhang, Jin Hong
Abstract: Retinal diseases are a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, with timely diagnosis being critical for effective treatment. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC) block is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.

Title: Koopman-Nemytskii Operator: A Linear Representation of Nonlinear Controlled Systems
Authors: Wentao Tang
Abstract: While Koopman operator lifts a nonlinear system into an infinite-dimensional function space and represents it as a linear dynamics, its definition is restricted to autonomous systems, i.e., does not incorporate inputs or disturbances. To the end of designing state-feedback controllers, the existing extensions of Koopman operator, which only account for the effect of open-loop values of inputs, does not involve feedback laws on closed-loop systems. Hence, in order to generically represent any nonlinear controlled dynamics linearly, this paper proposes a Koopman-Nemytskii operator, defined as a linear mapping from a product reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of states and feedback laws to an RKHS of states. Using the equivalence between RKHS and Sobolev-Hilbert spaces under certain regularity conditions on the dynamics and kernel selection, this operator is well-defined. Its data-based approximation, which follows a kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kernel EDMD) approach, have established errors in single-step and multi-step state predictions as well as accumulated cost under control.

Title: Fine Tuning a Simulation-Driven Estimator
Authors: Braghadeesh Lakshminarayanan, Margarita A. Guerrero, Cristian R. Rojas
Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.

Title: Verifiable Mission Planning For Space Operations
Authors: Quentin Rommel, Michael Hibbard, Pavan Shukla, Himanshu Save, Srinivas Bettadpur, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Spacecraft must operate under environmental and actuator uncertainties while meeting strict safety requirements. Traditional approaches rely on scenario-based heuristics that fail to account for stochastic influences, leading to suboptimal or unsafe plans. We propose a finite-horizon, chance-constrained Markov decision process for mission planning, where states represent mission and vehicle parameters, actions correspond to operational adjustments, and temporal logic specifications encode operational constraints. We synthesize policies that optimize mission objectives while ensuring constraints are met with high probability. Applied to the GRACE-FO mission, the approach accounts for stochastic solar activity and uncertain thrust performance, yielding maneuver schedules that maximize scientific return and provably satisfy safety requirements. This work demonstrates how Markov decision processes can be applied to space missions, enabling autonomous operation with formal guarantees.

Title: Planning Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in MDPs with Observation-Based Triggers
Authors: Xinyi Wei, Shuo Han, Ahmed H. Hemida, Charles A. Kamhoua, Jie Fu
Abstract: This paper investigates backdoor attack planning in stochastic control systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In a backdoor attack, the adversary provides a control policy that behaves well in the original MDP to pass the testing phase. However, when such a policy is deployed with a trigger policy, which perturbs the system dynamics at runtime, it optimizes the attacker's objective instead. To solve jointly the control policy and its trigger, we formulate the attack planning problem as a constrained optimal planning problem in an MDP with augmented state space, with the objective to maximize the attacker's total rewards in the system with an activated trigger, subject to the constraint that the control policy is near optimal in the original MDP. We then introduce a gradient-based optimization method to solve the optimal backdoor attack policy as a pair of coordinated control and trigger policies. Experimental results from a case study validate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving stealthy backdoor attacks.

Authors: Andreas Bouterakos, Joseph McKeon, Georgios Tzounas
Abstract: The paper focuses on the problem of tracking eigenvalue trajectories in large-scale power system models as system parameters vary. A continuation-based formulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which supports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and semi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such as numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and handling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical recommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.

Title: CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Mingxiu Cai, Hanxiao Wang, Gaochang Wu, Tianyou Chai, Xiatian Zhu
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: A Survey of Deep Learning for Complex Speech Spectrograms
Authors: Yuying Xie, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly impacted the field of speech signal processing, particularly in the analysis and manipulation of complex spectrograms. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art techniques leveraging deep neural networks for processing complex spectrograms, which encapsulate both magnitude and phase information. We begin by introducing complex spectrograms and their associated features for various speech processing tasks. Next, we examine the key components and architectures of complex-valued neural networks, which are specifically designed to handle complex-valued data and have been applied to complex spectrogram processing. As recent studies have primarily focused on applying real-valued neural networks to complex spectrograms, we revisit these approaches and their architectural designs. We then discuss various training strategies and loss functions tailored for training neural networks to process and model complex spectrograms. The survey further examines key applications, including phase retrieval, speech enhancement, and speaker separation, where deep learning has achieved significant progress by leveraging complex spectrograms or their derived feature representations. Additionally, we examine the intersection of complex spectrograms with generative models. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of speech signal processing, deep learning and related fields.

Title: Neural Parameter-varying Data-enabled Predictive Control of Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets
Authors: Pegah GhafGhanbari, Mircea Lazar, Javad Mohammadpour Velni
Abstract: Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets (APPJs) show significant potential for biomedical applications, but their inherent complexity, characterized by nonlinear dynamics and strong sensitivity to operating conditions like tip-to-surface distance, presents challenges for real-time control. This paper introduces the Neural Parameter-varying Data-enabled Predictive Control (NPV-DeePC) framework to address these issues. By integrating hypernetworks into the neural DeePC paradigm, NPV-DeePC adaptively captures system nonlinearities and parameter variations, dynamically adjusts the neural network's learned representation of the system, enabling accurate multi-step trajectory prediction and control. Simulation studies on surface temperature tracking and thermal dose delivery demonstrate that NPV-DeePC achieves higher accuracy and adaptability than existing controllers. Moreover, its computational efficiency supports real-time implementation, making it a practical approach for precise APPJ control and a generalizable solution for other nonlinear, parameter-varying systems.

Title: Robust Pan-Cancer Mitotic Figure Detection with YOLOv12
Authors: Raphaël Bourgade, Guillaume Balezo, Thomas Walter
Abstract: Mitotic figures represent a key histoprognostic feature in tumor pathology, providing crucial insights into tumor aggressiveness and proliferation. However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figure detection approach based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv12 object detection architecture. Our method achieved an F1-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set (hotspots only) and ranked second on the final test leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.7216 across complex and heterogeneous whole-slide regions, without relying on external data.

Title: Stochastic Security Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow Using General Polynomial Chaos Expansion
Authors: Ghulam Mohy-ud-din, Yunqi Wang, Rahmat Heidari, Frederik Geth
Abstract: Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.

Title: Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems
Authors: Yanhua Tan, Beixiong Zheng, Yi Fang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jie Xu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.

Title: Neural Network-based Co-design of Output-Feedback Control Barrier Function and Observer
Authors: Vaishnavi Jagabathula, Ahan Basu, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller, observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.

Title: Radiation Pattern Reconfigurable FAS-Empowered Interference-Resilient UAV Communication
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Zhen Gao, Boyu Ning, Zhaocheng Wang
Abstract: The widespread use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) has propelled the development of advanced techniques on countering unauthorized UAV flights. However, the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains under-addressed. This paper proposes radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (RPR-FAS)-empowered interference-resilient UAV communication scheme. This scheme integrates the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology, which provides each antenna with an adjustable radiation pattern. Therefore, RPR-FAS can enhance the angular resolution of a UAV with a limited number of antennas, thereby improving spectral efficiency (SE) and interference resilience. Specifically, we first design dedicated radiation pattern adapted from 3GPP-TR-38.901, where the beam direction and half power beamwidth are tailored for UAV communications. Furthermore, we propose a low-storage-overhead orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors algorithm, which accurately estimates the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the communication link, even in the single antenna case. Particularly, by utilizing the Fourier transform to the radiation pattern gain matrix, we design a dimension-reduction technique to achieve 1--2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements. Meanwhile, we propose a maximum likelihood interference AoA estimation method based on the law of large numbers, so that the SE can be further improved. Finally, alternating optimization is employed to obtain the optimal uplink radiation pattern and combiner, while an exhaustive search is applied to determine the optimal downlink pattern, complemented by the water-filling algorithm for beamforming. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform traditional methods in terms of angular sensing precision and spectral efficiency.

Title: Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks
Authors: Jeong Min Kong, Eunsun Kim, Ian P. Roberts
Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users. Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies; therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users. Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline, achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

Title: Exactly or Approximately Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation According to Wasserstein Radii Being Small or Large
Authors: Xiao Ding, Enbin Song, Dunbiao Niu, Zhujun Cao, Qingjiang Shi
Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate our theoretical results.

Title: Linear-quadratic mean-field-type difference games with coupled affine inequality constraints
Authors: Partha Sarathi Mohapatra, Puduru Viswanadha Reddy
Abstract: In this letter, we study a class of linear-quadratic mean-field-type difference games with coupled affine inequality constraints. We show that the mean-field-type equilibrium can be characterized by the existence of a multiplier process which satisfies some implicit complementarity conditions. Further, we show that the equilibrium strategies can be computed by reformulating these conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. We illustrate our results with an energy storage problem arising in the management of microgrids.

Title: Unified Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Gaochang Wu, Jing Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyou Chai
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Improved Monte Carlo Planning via Causal Disentanglement for Structurally-Decomposed Markov Decision Processes
Authors: Larkin Liu, Shiqi Liu, Yinruo Hua, Matej Jusup
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), as a general-purpose framework, often overlook the benefits of incorporating the causal structure of the transition and reward dynamics. For a subclass of resource allocation problems, we introduce the Structurally Decomposed MDP (SD-MDP), which leverages causal disentanglement to partition an MDP's temporal causal graph into independent components. By exploiting this disentanglement, SD-MDP enables dimensionality reduction and computational efficiency gains in optimal value function estimation. We reduce the sequential optimization problem to a fractional knapsack problem with log-linear complexity $O(T \log T)$, outperforming traditional stochastic programming methods that exhibit polynomial complexity with respect to the time horizon $T$. Additionally, SD-MDP's computational advantages are independent of state-action space size, making it viable for high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, our approach integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), achieving higher expected rewards under constrained simulation budgets while providing a vanishing simple regret bound.

Title: PAGURI: a user experience study of creative interaction with text-to-music models
Authors: Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Gabriele Perego, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-music models have been the biggest breakthrough in automatic music generation. While they are unquestionably a showcase of technological progress, it is not clear yet how they can be realistically integrated into the artistic practice of musicians and music practitioners. This paper aims to address this question via Prompt Audio Generation User Research Investigation (PAGURI), a user experience study where we leverage recent text-to-music developments to study how musicians and practitioners interact with these systems, evaluating their satisfaction levels. We developed an online tool through which users can generate music samples and/or apply recently proposed personalization techniques based on fine-tuning to allow the text-to-music model to generate sounds closer to their needs and preferences. Using semi-structured interviews, we analyzed different aspects related to how participants interacted with the proposed tool to understand the current effectiveness and limitations of text-to-music models in enhancing users' creativity. Our research centers on user experiences to uncover insights that can guide the future development of TTM models and their role in AI-driven music creation. Additionally, they offered insightful perspectives on potential system improvements and their integration into their music practices. The results obtained through the study reveal the pros and cons of the use of TTMs for creative endeavors. Participants recognized the system's creative potential and appreciated the usefulness of its personalization features. However, they also identified several challenges that must be addressed before TTMs are ready for real-world music creation, particularly issues of prompt ambiguity, limited controllability, and integration into existing workflows.

Title: Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves: Representation, measurements and insights
Authors: Junyi Ji, Derek Gloudemans, Yanbing Wang, Gergely Zachár, William Barbour, Jonathan Sprinkle, Benedetto Piccoli, Daniel B. Work
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the availability of large-scale traffic data containing traffic waves and complex congestion patterns, making existing approaches unsuitable for repeatable and scalable analysis of traffic waves in these data. This paper makes a first step towards addressing this challenge by introducing an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. It enables the measurement of wave properties at scale. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. Our results show insights on the complexity of traffic waves. Traffic waves can bifurcate and merge at a scale that has never been observed or described before. The clustering analysis of all the identified wave components reveals the different topological structures of traffic waves. We explored that the wave merge or bifurcation points can be explained by spatial features. The gallery of all the identified wave topologies is demonstrated at this https URL.

Title: Ultrasound matrix imaging for 3D transcranial in vivo localization microscopy
Authors: Flavien Bureau, Louise Denis, Antoine Coudert, Mathias Fink, Olivier Couture, Alexandre Aubry
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can also be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and nonionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.

Title: Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer
Authors: Yongxin Zhu, Bocheng Li, Yifei Xin, Zhihua Xia, Linli Xu
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures. The code is available at this https URL.

Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of audio signals from degraded measurements. We propose a lightweight model that combines the discrete Fourier transform with a Convolutional Autoencoder (FFT-ConvAE), which enabled our team to achieve second place in the Helsinki Speech Challenge 2024. Our results, together with those of other teams, demonstrate the potential of neural-network-free approaches for effective speech signal reconstruction.

Title: Detection and characterization of targets in complex media using fingerprint matrices
Authors: Arthur Le Ber, Antton Goïcoechea, Lukas M. Rachbauer, William Lambert, Xiaoping Jia, Mathias Fink, Arnaud Tourin, Stefan Rotter, Alexandre Aubry
Abstract: When waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo several scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes full blurring of the image. Here we describe a method for detecting, localizing and characterizing any scattering target embedded in a complex medium. We introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. When applied to the recorded reflection matrix, it provides a likelihood index of the target state. This state can be the position of the target for localization purposes, its shape for characterization or any other parameter that influences its response. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by performing proof-of-concept ultrasound experiments on elastic spheres buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension and on lesion markers, which are commonly used to monitor breast tumours, embedded in a foam mimicking soft tissue. Furthermore, we show how the fingerprint operator can be leveraged to characterize the complex medium itself by mapping the fibre architecture within muscle tissue. Our method is broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.

Title: Active Alignments of Lens Systems with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Matthias Burkhardt, Tobias Schmähling, Pascal Stegmann, Michael Layh, Tobias Windisch
Abstract: Aligning a lens system relative to an imager is a critical challenge in camera manufacturing. While optimal alignment can be mathematically computed under ideal conditions, real-world deviations caused by manufacturing tolerances often render this approach impractical. Measuring these tolerances can be costly or even infeasible, and neglecting them may result in suboptimal alignments. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns exclusively in the pixel space of the sensor output, eliminating the need to develop expert-designed alignment concepts. We conduct an extensive benchmark study and show that our approach surpasses other methods in speed, precision, and robustness. We further introduce relign, a realistic, freely explorable, open-source simulation utilizing physically based rendering that models optical systems with non-deterministic manufacturing tolerances and noise in robotic alignment movement. It provides an interface to popular machine learning frameworks, enabling seamless experimentation and development. Our work highlights the potential of RL in a manufacturing environment to enhance efficiency of optical alignments while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Title: Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections
Authors: Mahdis Rabbani, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.

Title: Theoretical Model of Microparticle-Assisted Super-Resolution Microscopy
Authors: A. R Bekirov
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional theoretical model of microparticle-assisted super-resolution imaging, enabling accurate simulation of virtual image formation. The model reveals that accounting for partial spatial coherence of illumination is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving super-resolution. We also propose a novel illumination strategy based on suppressing the normal component of incident light, which enhances image contrast and resolution. The results establish a consistent wave-optical framework that reproduces experimentally observed subwavelength imaging and clarifies the underlying physical mechanisms.

Title: Enhancing Monocular Height Estimation via Sparse LiDAR-Guided Correction
Authors: Jian Song, Hongruixuan Chen, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of sufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models (DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain costly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data and refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE, yet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they truly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained purely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height predictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily on shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of heights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent difficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores additional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues, we propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global LiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local accuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two stages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based approach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three representative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal substantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 22.8\%, 6.9\%, and 4.9\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how fusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE, paving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.

Title: JALMBench: Benchmarking Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Audio Language Models
Authors: Zifan Peng, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Mingchen Li, Zeren Luo, Jingyi Zheng, Wenhan Dong, Xinlei He, Xuechao Wang, Yingjie Xue, Shengmin Xu, Xinyi Huang
Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have made significant progress recently. These models integrate the audio modality directly into the model, rather than converting speech into text and inputting text to Large Language Models (LLMs). While jailbreak attacks on LLMs have been extensively studied, the security of ALMs with audio modalities remains largely unexplored. Currently, there is a lack of an adversarial audio dataset and a unified framework specifically designed to evaluate and compare attacks and ALMs. In this paper, we present JALMBench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the safety of ALMs against jailbreak attacks. JALMBench includes a dataset containing 11,316 text samples and 245,355 audio samples with over 1,000 hours. It supports 12 mainstream ALMs, 4 text-transferred and 4 audio-originated attack methods, and 5 defense methods. Using JALMBench, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack efficiency, topic sensitivity, voice diversity, and architecture. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies for the attacks at both the prompt level and the response level.

Title: HopaDIFF: Holistic-Partial Aware Fourier Conditioned Diffusion for Referring Human Action Segmentation in Multi-Person Scenarios
Authors: Kunyu Peng, Junchao Huang, Xiangsheng Huang, Di Wen, Junwei Zheng, Yufan Chen, Kailun Yang, Jiamin Wu, Chongqing Hao, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action segmentation methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The dataset and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Online Feedback Optimization for Monotone Systems without Timescale Separation
Authors: Mattia Bianchi, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) steers a dynamical plant to a cost-efficient steady-state, only relying on input-output sensitivity information, rather than on a full plant model. Unlike traditional feedforward approaches, OFO leverages real-time measurements from the plant, thereby inheriting the robustness and adaptability of feedback control. Unfortunately, existing theoretical guarantees for OFO assume that the controller operates on a slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and transient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale separation'' assumption. Specifically, we consider the class of monotone systems, and we prove that OFO can achieve an optimal operating point, regardless of the time constants of controller and plant. By leveraging a small gain theorem for monotone systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for global convergence. Notably, these conditions depend only on the steady-state behavior of the plant, and they are entirely independent of the transient dynamics.

Title: Neuromorphic Deployment of Spiking Neural Networks for Cognitive Load Classification in Air Traffic Control
Authors: Jiahui An, Chonghao Cai, Olympia Gallou, Sara Irina Fabrikant, Giacomo Indiveri, Elisa Donati
Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic system for cognitive load classification in a real-world setting, an Air Traffic Control (ATC) task, using a hardware implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Title: YOLO-Based Defect Detection for Metal Sheets
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Chun-Chi Wang, Wei-Lung Mao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.

Title: SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment
Authors: Yuxun Tang, Lan Liu, Wenhao Feng, Yiwen Zhao, Jionghao Han, Yifeng Yu, Jiatong Shi, Qin Jin
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be accessed at this https URL.
