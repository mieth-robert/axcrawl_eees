Title: Depth Separable architecture for Sentinel-5P Super-Resolution
Authors: Hyam Omar Ali, Romain Abraham, Bruno Galerne
Abstract: Sentinel-5P (S5P) satellite provides atmospheric measurements for air quality and climate monitoring. While the S5P satellite offers rich spectral resolution, it inherits physical limitations that restricts its spatial resolution. Super-resolution (SR) techniques can overcome these limitations and enhance the spatial resolution of S5P data. In this work, we introduce a novel SR model specifically designed for S5P data that have eight spectral bands with around 500 channels for each band. Our proposed S5-DSCR model relies on Depth Separable Convolution (DSC) architecture to effectively perform spatial SR by exploiting cross-channel correlations. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms existing methods for the majority of the spectral bands. This work highlights the potential of leveraging DSC architecture to address the challenges of hyperspectral SR. Our model allows for capturing fine details necessary for precise analysis and paves the way for advancements in air quality monitoring as well as remote sensing applications.

Title: MR imaging in the low-field: Leveraging the power of machine learning
Authors: Andreas Kofler, Dongyue Si, David Schote, Rene M Botnar, Christoph Kolbitsch, Claudia Prieto
Abstract: Recent innovations in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) hardware and software have reignited interest in low-field ($<1\,\mathrm{T}$) and ultra-low-field MRI ($<0.1\,\mathrm{T}$). These technologies offer advantages such as lower power consumption, reduced specific absorption rate, reduced field-inhomogeneities, and cost-effectiveness, presenting a promising alternative for resource-limited and point-of-care settings. However, low-field MRI faces inherent challenges like reduced signal-to-noise ratio and therefore, potentially lower spatial resolution or longer scan times. This chapter examines the challenges and opportunities of low-field and ultra-low-field MRI, with a focus on the role of machine learning (ML) in overcoming these limitations. We provide an overview of deep neural networks and their application in enhancing low-field and ultra-low-field MRI performance. Specific ML-based solutions, including advanced image reconstruction, denoising, and super-resolution algorithms, are discussed. The chapter concludes by exploring how integrating ML with low-field MRI could expand its clinical applications and improve accessibility, potentially revolutionizing its use in diverse healthcare settings.

Title: Measurement-Based Modeling and Analysis of UAV Air-Ground Channels at 1 and 4 GHz
Authors: Zhuangzhuang Cui, Cesar Briso-Rodriguez, Ke Guan, Cesar Calvo-Ramirez, Bo Ai, Zhangdui Zhong
Abstract: In the design of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless communications, a better understanding of propagation characteristics and an accurate channel model are required. Measurements and comprehensive analysis for the UAV-based air-ground (AG) propagation channel in the vertical dimension are presented in this letter. Based on the measurement data at 1 and 4 GHz, the large-scale and small-scale channel parameters are extracted in the line-of-sight (LOS) and nonLOS case, respectively. The altitude-dependent path loss model is proposed herein. Furthermore, shadow fading and fast fading are statistically analyzed for comprehensively describing the fading behavior. Our results will be useful in the modeling of AG channels and the performance analysis for UAV-enabled wireless communication systems.

Title: 5G Channel Models for Railway Use Cases at mmWave Band and the Path Towards Terahertz
Authors: Ke Guan, Juan Moreno Garcia-Lloygorri, Bo Ai, Cesar Briso-Rodriguez, Bile Peng, Danping He, Andrej Hrovat, Zhangdui Zhong, Thomas Kurner
Abstract: High-speed trains are one of the most relevant scenarios for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications and the "smart rail mobility" vision, where a high-data-rate wireless connectivity with up to several GHz bandwidths will be required. This is a strong motivation for the exploration of millimeter wave (mmWave) band. In this article, we identify the main challenges and make progress towards realistic 5G mmWave channel models for railway use cases. In order to cope with the challenge of including the railway features in the channel models, we define reference scenarios to help the parameterization of channel models for railway use at mmWave band. Simulations and the subsequent measurements used to validate the model reflect the detailed influence of railway objects and the accuracy of the simulations. Finally, we point out the future directions towards the full version of the smart rail mobility which will be powered by terahertz (THz) communications.

Title: Floodgates up to contain the DeePC and limit extrapolation
Authors: Mohammad Ramadan, Evan Toler, Mihai Anitescu
Abstract: Behavioral data-enabled control approaches typically assume data-generating systems of linear dynamics. This may result in false generalization if the newly designed closed-loop system results in input-output distributional shifts beyond learning data. These shifts may compromise safety by activating harmful nonlinearities in the data-generating system not experienced previously in the data and/or not captured by the linearity assumption inherent in these approaches. This paper proposes an approach to slow down the distributional shifts and therefore enhance the safety of the data-enabled methods. This is achieved by introducing quadratic regularization terms to the data-enabled predictive control formulations. Slowing down the distributional shifts comes at the expense of slowing down the exploration, in a trade-off resembling the exploration vs exploitation balance in machine learning.

Title: Capacity Expansion Planning under Uncertainty subject to Expected Energy Not Served Constraints
Authors: Marilena Zampara, Daniel Ávila, Anthony Papavasiliou
Abstract: We present a method for solving a large-scale stochastic capacity expansion problem which explicitly considers reliability constraints, in particular constraints on expected energy not served. Our method tackles this problem by a Lagrange relaxation of the expected energy not served constraints. We solve the relaxed formulation in an iterative manner, using a subgradient-based method. Each iteration requires the solution of a stochastic capacity expansion problem, for which we implement a subgradient decomposition scheme in a high-performance computing infrastructure. We apply the proposed methodology on the Economic Viability Assessment model that is used by ENTSO-E in the annual European Resource Adequacy Assessment, extended to include explicit reliability constraints. The approach is able to solve this model achieving a 1.3% optimality gap. We compare our approach against accounting for reliability through penalizing load shedding at VOLL, and find that the former results in 1.6% savings in total cost. We are also able to quantify the cost savings from allowing some load curtailment in the capacity planning process, which ranges from 1.6 to 6% in the cases analyzed.

Title: A Sampling Complexity-aware Framework for Discrete-time Fractional-Order Dynamical System Identification
Authors: Xiaole Zhang, Vijay Gupta, Paul Bogdan
Abstract: A variety of complex biological, natural and man-made systems exhibit non-Markovian dynamics that can be modeled through fractional order differential equations, yet, we lack sample comlexity aware system identification strategies. Towards this end, we propose an affine discrete-time fractional order dynamical system (FoDS) identification algorithm and provide a detailed sample complexity analysis. The algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of FoDS identification in the presence of noisy data. The proposed algorithm consists of two key steps. Firstly, it avoids solving higher-order polynomial equations, which would otherwise result in multiple potential solutions for the fractional orders. Secondly, the identification problem is reformulated as a least squares estimation, allowing us to infer the system parameters. We derive the expectation and probabilistic bounds for the FoDS parameter estimation error, assuming prior knowledge of the functions \( f \) and \( g \) in the FoDS model. The error decays at a rate of \( N = O\left( \frac{d}{\epsilon} \right) \), where \( N \) is the number of samples, \( d \) is the dimension of the state variable, and \( \epsilon \) represents the desired estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that our theoretical bounds are tight, validating the accuracy and robustness of this algorithm.

Title: Accelerated DC loadflow solver for topology optimization
Authors: Nico Westerbeck, Joost van Dijk, Jan Viebahn, Christian Merz, Dirk Witthaut
Abstract: We present a massively parallel solver that accelerates DC loadflow computations for power grid topology optimization tasks. Our approach leverages low-rank updates of the Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) to represent substation splits, line outages, and reconfigurations without ever refactorizing the system. Furthermore, we implement the core routines on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), thereby exploiting their high-throughput architecture for linear algebra. A two-level decomposition separates changes in branch topology from changes in nodal injections, enabling additional speed-ups by an in-the-loop brute force search over injection variations at minimal additional cost. We demonstrate billion-loadflow-per-second performance on power grids of varying sizes in workload settings which are typical for gradient-free topology optimization such as Reinforcement Learning or Quality Diversity methods. While adopting the DC approximation sacrifices some accuracy and prohibits the computation of voltage magnitudes, we show that this sacrifice unlocks new scales of computational feasibility, offering a powerful tool for large-scale grid planning and operational topology optimization.

Title: Pole-Zero Identification: Unveiling the Critical Dynamics of Microwave Circuits Beyond Stability Analysis
Authors: Juan-Mari Collantes, Libe Mori, Aitziber Anakabe, Nerea Otegi, Natanael Ayllon, Franco Ramirez, Vincent Armengaud, Geoffroy Soubercaze-Pun
Abstract: Pole-zero identification refers to the obtaining of the poles and zeros of a linear (or linearized) system described by its frequency response. This is usually done using optimization techniques (such as least squares, maximum likelihood estimation, or vector fitting) that fit a given frequency response of the linear system to a transfer function defined as the ratio of two polynomials. This kind of linear system identification in the frequency domain has numerous applications in a wide variety of engineering fields (such as mechanical systems, power systems and Electromagnetic Compatibility). In the microwave domain, rational approximation is increasingly used to obtain black-box models of complex passive structures for model order reduction and efficient transient simulation. In this paper we will focus on a different application of pole-zero identification. We will review the different ways in which pole-zero identification can be applied to nonlinear circuit design (for power amplifier stability analysis and beyond). We will give a comprehensive view on recent approaches through illustrative application examples. Other uses of rational approximation techniques are beyond the scope of this paper.

Title: Efficient Calculation of Stabilization Parameters in RF Power Amplifiers
Authors: Libe Mori, Ibone Lizarraga, Aitziber Anakabe, Juan-Mari Collantes, Vincent Armengaud, Geoffroy Soubercaze-Pun
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for the calculation of the stabilization parameters in RF power amplifiers operating in periodic large-signal regimes. Stabilization is achieved by applying the principles of linear control theory for Periodic Linear Time-Varying (PLTV) systems. A numerical method is proposed to obtain the Harmonic Transfer Function that represents the system linearized around the large-signal steady state. Then, a feedback analysis is performed to calculate the closed-loop poles of the PLTV system. The proposed approach is demonstrated with two examples. Firstly, a three-stage amplifier that exhibits a low-frequency oscillation for increasing values of input power is correctly stabilized. Next, the stabilization of an unstable design that exhibits an odd-mode parametric oscillation is presented. The results of the proposed technique are compared to those obtained with the conventional parametric stability simulation. These examples serve to illustrate the capability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Title: Coalitional model predictive control of an irrigation canal
Authors: Filiberto Fele, José M. Maestre, Mehdi Hashemy Shahdany, David Muñoz de la Peña, Eduardo F. Camacho
Abstract: We present a hierarchical control scheme for large-scale systems whose components can exchange information through a data network. The main goal of the supervisory layer is to find the best compromise between control performance and communicational costs by actively modifying the network topology. The actions taken at the supervisory layer alter the control agents' knowledge of the complete system, and the set of agents with which they can communicate. Each group of linked subsystems, or coalition, is independently controlled based on a decentralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme, managed at the bottom layer. Hard constraints on the inputs are imposed, while soft constraints on the states are considered to avoid feasibility issues. The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated on a model of the Dez irrigation canal, implemented on the accurate simulator for water systems SOBEK. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained using a centralized MPC controller.

Title: Trustworthy image-to-image translation: evaluating uncertainty calibration in unpaired training scenarios
Authors: Ciaran Bench, Emir Ahmed, Spencer A. Thomas
Abstract: Mammographic screening is an effective method for detecting breast cancer, facilitating early diagnosis. However, the current need to manually inspect images places a heavy burden on healthcare systems, spurring a desire for automated diagnostic protocols. Techniques based on deep neural networks have been shown effective in some studies, but their tendency to overfit leaves considerable risk for poor generalisation and misdiagnosis, preventing their widespread adoption in clinical settings. Data augmentation schemes based on unpaired neural style transfer models have been proposed that improve generalisability by diversifying the representations of training image features in the absence of paired training data (images of the same tissue in either image style). But these models are similarly prone to various pathologies, and evaluating their performance is challenging without ground truths/large datasets (as is often the case in medical imaging). Here, we consider two frameworks/architectures: a GAN-based cycleGAN, and the more recently developed diffusion-based SynDiff. We evaluate their performance when trained on image patches parsed from three open access mammography datasets and one non-medical image dataset. We consider the use of uncertainty quantification to assess model trustworthiness, and propose a scheme to evaluate calibration quality in unpaired training scenarios. This ultimately helps facilitate the trustworthy use of image-to-image translation models in domains where ground truths are not typically available.

Title: Coalitional Control: Cooperative game theory and control
Authors: Filiberto Fele, José M. Maestre, Eduardo F. Camacho
Abstract: The evolution of information and communication technologies has yielded the means of sharing measurements and other information in an efficient and flexible way, which has enabled the size and complexity of control applications to increase. At the same time, the improvements in the computational and communicational capabilities of control devices have fostered the development of noncentralized control architectures, already motivated by the inherent structural constraints of large-scale systems. Computer-based control approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) are visible beneficiaries of these advances and have registered a significant growth regarding both theoretical and applied fields. Coalitional control focuses on the local interests that motivate the controllers to assemble, an aspect so far rarely contemplated in the distributed control literature. This article presents the main concepts and challenges in coalitional control, and the links with cooperative network game theory.

Title: Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Prosumer District Heating Networks: The Extended Version
Authors: Max Sibeijn, Saeed Ahmed, Mohammad Khosravi, Tamás Keviczky
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an economic nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for district heating networks (DHNs). The proposed method features prosumers, multiple producers, and storage systems, which are essential components of 4th generation DHNs. These networks are characterized by their ability to optimize their operations, aiming to reduce supply temperatures, accommodate distributed heat sources, and leverage the flexibility provided by thermal inertia and storage, all crucial for achieving a fossil-fuel-free energy supply. Developing a smart energy management system to accomplish these goals requires detailed models of highly complex nonlinear systems and computational algorithms able to handle large-scale optimization problems. To address this, we introduce a graph-based optimization-oriented model that efficiently integrates distributed producers, prosumers, storage buffers, and bidirectional pipe flows, such that it can be implemented in a real-time MPC setting. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in closed-loop. Our findings demonstrate that the MPC methods achieved up to 9% cost improvement over traditional rule-based controllers while better maintaining system constraints.

Title: Coalitional control: a bottom-up approach
Authors: Filiberto Fele, José M. Maestre, Eduardo F. Camacho
Abstract: The recent major developments in information technologies have opened interesting possibilities for the effective management of multi-agent systems. In many cases, the important role of central control nodes can now be undertaken by several controllers in a distributed topology that suits better the structure of the system. This opens as well the possibility to promote cooperation between control agents in competitive environments, establishing links between controllers in order to adapt the exchange of critical information to the degree of subsystems' interactions. In this paper a bottom-up approach to coalitional control is presented, where the structure of each agent's model predictive controller is adapted to the time-variant coupling conditions, promoting the formation of coalitions - clusters of control agents where communication is essential to ensure the cooperation - whenever it can bring benefit to the overall system performance.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Power System Dynamics: Improving Simulation Accuracy
Authors: Ignasi Ventura Nadal, Rahul Nellikkath, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: The importance and cost of time-domain simulations when studying power systems have exponentially increased in the last decades. With the growing share of renewable energy sources, the slow and predictable responses from large turbines are replaced by the fast and unpredictable dynamics from power electronics. The current existing simulation tools require new solutions designed for faster dynamics. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged in power systems to accelerate such simulations. By incorporating knowledge during the up-front training, PINNs provide more accurate results over larger time steps than traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces PINNs as an alternative approximation method that seamlessly integrates with the current simulation framework. We replace a synchronous machine for a trained PINN in the IEEE 9-, 14-, and 30-bus systems and simulate several network disturbances. Including PINNs systematically boosts the simulations' accuracy, providing more accurate results for both the PINN-modeled component and the whole multi-machine system states.

Title: Adaptively Weighted Averaging Over-the-Air Computation and Its Application to Distributed Gaussian Process Regression
Authors: Koya Sato, Koji Ishibashi
Abstract: This paper introduces a noise-tolerant computing method for over-the-air computation (AirComp) aimed at weighted averaging, which is critical in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as environmental monitoring. Traditional AirComp approaches, while efficient, suffer significantly in accuracy due to noise enhancement in the normalization by the sum of weights. Our proposed method allows nodes to adaptively truncate their weights based on the channel conditions, thereby enhancing noise tolerance. Applied to distributed Gaussian process regression, the method facilitates low-latency, low-complexity, and high-accuracy distributed regression across a range of signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a radio map construction problem, which is a task for visualizing the radio environment based on limited sensing information and spatial interpolation. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach not only maintains computational accuracy in high noise scenarios but also achieves performance close to ideal conditions in high SNR environments. This advancement holds significant implications for the deployment of real-time, large-scale IoT systems, providing a scalable solution to enhance reliability and efficiency in data-driven environmental monitoring.

Title: Dual Invariance Self-training for Reliable Semi-supervised Surgical Phase Recognition
Authors: Sahar Nasirihaghighi, Negin Ghamsarian, Raphael Sznitman, Klaus Schoeffmann
Abstract: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for advancing computer-assisted interventions, yet the scarcity of labeled data hinders training reliable deep learning models. Semi-supervised learning (SSL), particularly with pseudo-labeling, shows promise over fully supervised methods but often lacks reliable pseudo-label assessment mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose a novel SSL framework, Dual Invariance Self-Training (DIST), that incorporates both Temporal and Transformation Invariance to enhance surgical phase recognition. Our two-step self-training process dynamically selects reliable pseudo-labels, ensuring robust pseudo-supervision. Our approach mitigates the risk of noisy pseudo-labels, steering decision boundaries toward true data distribution and improving generalization to unseen data. Evaluations on Cataract and Cholec80 datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art SSL approaches, consistently surpassing both supervised and SSL baselines across various network architectures.

Title: Analysis and Control of Perturbed Density Systems
Authors: Igor Furtat
Abstract: The paper investigates dynamical systems for which the derivative of some positive-definite function along the solutions of this system depends on so-called density function. In turn, such dynamical systems are called density systems. The density function sets the density of the space, where the system is evolved, and affects the behaviour of the original system. For example, this function can define (un)stable regions and forbidden regions where there are no system solutions. The density function can be used in the design of new adaptive control laws with the formulation of appropriate new control goals, e.g., stabilization in given bounded or semi-bounded sets. To design a novel adaptive control law that ensures the system outputs in a given set, systems with known and unknown parameters under disturbances are considered. All theoretical results and conclusions are illustrated by numerical simulations.

Title: PulmoFusion: Advancing Pulmonary Health with Efficient Multi-Modal Fusion
Authors: Ahmed Sharshar, Yasser Attia, Mohammad Yaqub, Mohsen Guizani
Abstract: Traditional remote spirometry lacks the precision required for effective pulmonary monitoring. We present a novel, non-invasive approach using multimodal predictive models that integrate RGB or thermal video data with patient metadata. Our method leverages energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for the regression of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and classification of Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), using lightweight CNNs to overcome SNN limitations in regression tasks. Multimodal data integration is improved with a Multi-Head Attention Layer, and we employ K-Fold validation and ensemble learning to boost robustness. Using thermal data, our SNN models achieve 92% accuracy on a breathing-cycle basis and 99.5% patient-wise. PEF regression models attain Relative RMSEs of 0.11 (thermal) and 0.26 (RGB), with an MAE of 4.52% for FEV1/FVC predictions, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Predictive Beamforming with Distributed MIMO
Authors: Hasret Taha Akçalı, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Tolga Girici, Emil Björnson
Abstract: In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, roadside units (RSUs) can be tasked with both sensing and communication functions to enable sensing-assisted communications. Recent studies have demonstrated that distance, angle, and velocity information obtained through sensing can be leveraged to reduce the overhead associated with communication beam tracking. In this work, we extend this concept to scenarios involving multiple distributed RSUs and distributed MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems. We derive the state evolution model, formulate the extended Kalman-filter equations, and implement predictive beamforming for distributed MIMO. Simulation results indicate that, when compared with a co-located massive MIMO antenna array, distributed antennas lead to more uniform and robust sensing performance, coverage, and data rates, while the vehicular user is in motion.

Title: Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System for Tumor Layered Diagnosis via Multi-task Semi-supervised Learning
Authors: Yihao Liu, Zhihao Cui, Liming Li, Junjie You, Xinle Feng, Jianxin Wang, Xiangyu Wang, Qing Liu, Minghua Wu
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Multimodal MRI is widely used for the preliminary screening of gliomas and plays a crucial role in auxiliary diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and prognostic evaluation. Currently, the computer-aided diagnostic studies of gliomas using MRI have focused on independent analysis events such as tumor segmentation, grading, and radiogenomic classification, without studying inter-dependencies among these events. In this study, we propose a Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System (GMMAS) that utilizes a deep learning network for processing multiple events simultaneously, leveraging their inter-dependencies through an uncertainty-based multi-task learning architecture and synchronously outputting tumor region segmentation, glioma histological subtype, IDH mutation genotype, and 1p/19q chromosome disorder status. Compared with the reported single-task analysis models, GMMAS improves the precision across tumor layered diagnostic tasks. Additionally, we have employed a two-stage semi-supervised learning method, enhancing model performance by fully exploiting both labeled and unlabeled MRI samples. Further, by utilizing an adaptation module based on knowledge self-distillation and contrastive learning for cross-modal feature extraction, GMMAS exhibited robustness in situations of modality absence and revealed the differing significance of each MRI modal. Finally, based on the analysis outputs of the GMMAS, we created a visual and user-friendly platform for doctors and patients, introducing GMMAS-GPT to generate personalized prognosis evaluations and suggestions.

Title: Self-Supervised Frameworks for Speaker Verification via Bootstrapped Positive Sampling
Authors: Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak
Abstract: Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Standard SSL frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs extracted from the same audio utterances. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, as we assume that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method demonstrates consistent improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when implemented in major SSL frameworks, such as SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR, and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.

Title: Low-Complexity Multi-Target Detection in ELAA ISAC
Authors: Diluka Galappaththige, Shayan Zargari, Chintha Tellambura, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Multi-target detection and communication with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) operating at high frequencies necessitate generating multiple beams. However, conventional algorithms are slow and computationally intensive. For instance, they can simulate a \num{200}-antenna system over two weeks, and the time complexity grows exponentially with the number of antennas. Thus, this letter explores an ultra-low-complex solution for a multi-user, multi-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system equipped with an ELAA base station (BS). It maximizes the communication sum rate while meeting sensing beampattern gain targets and transmit power constraints. As this problem is non-convex, a Riemannian stochastic gradient descent-based augmented Lagrangian manifold optimization (SGALM) algorithm is developed, which searches on a manifold to ensure constraint compliance. The algorithm achieves ultra-low complexity and superior runtime performance compared to conventional algorithms. For example, it is \num{56} times faster than the standard benchmark for \num{257} BS antennas.

Title: Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using Normal Forcing
Authors: Aakash Khandelwal, Ranjan Mukherjee
Abstract: The problem of realizing rotary propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using forces purely normal to the stick is considered. This problem represents a nonprehensile manipulation task of an underactuated system. In contrast with previous approaches, the devil-stick is manipulated by controlling the normal force and its point of application. Virtual holonomic constraints are used to design the trajectory of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick in terms of its orientation angle, and conditions for stable propeller motion are derived. Intermittent large-amplitude forces are used to asymptotically stabilize a desired propeller motion. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in realizing stable propeller motion without loss of contact between the actuator and devil-stick.

Title: Recyclable Thin-Film Soft Electronics for Smart Packaging and E-Skins
Authors: Manuel Reis Carneiro, Anibal T. de Almeida, Mahmoud Tavakoli, Carmel Majidi
Abstract: Despite advances in soft, sticker_like electronics, few efforts have dealt with the challenge of electronic waste. Here, this is addressed by introducing an eco friendly conductive ink for thin_film circuitry composed of silver flakes and a water_based polyurethane dispersion. This ink uniquely combines high electrical conductivity (1.6 x 105 S m_1), high resolution digital printability, robust adhesion for microchip integration, mechanical resilience, and recyclability. Recycling is achieved with an ecologically friendly processing method to decompose the circuits into constituent elements and recover the conductive ink with a decrease of only 2.4 per cent in conductivity. Moreover, adding liquid metal enables stretchability of up to 200 per cent strain, although this introduces the need for more complex recycling steps. Finally, on_skin electrophysiological monitoring biostickers along with a recyclable smart package with integrated sensors for monitoring safe storage of perishable foods are demonstrated.

Title: Replacing the Gallium Oxide Shell with Conductive Ag: Toward a Printable and Recyclable Composite for Highly Stretchable Electronics, Electromagnetic Shielding, and Thermal Interfaces
Authors: Abdollah Hajalilou, Elahe Parvini, Tiago A. Morgado, Pedro Alhais Lopes, M. Estrela Melo Jorge, Marta Freitas, Mahmoud Tavakoli
Abstract: Liquid metal (LM)-based composites hold promise for soft electronics due to their high conductivity and fluidic nature. However, the presence of {\alpha}_Ga2O3 and GaOOH layers around LM droplets impairs conductivity and performance. We tackle this issue by replacing the oxide layer with conductive silver (Ag) using an ultrasonic_assisted galvanic replacement reaction. The Ag_coated nanoparticles form aggregated, porous microparticles that are mixed with styrene_isoprene_styrene (SIS) polymers, resulting in a digitally printable composite with superior electrical conductivity and electromechanical properties compared to conventional fillers. Adding more LM enhances these properties further. The composite achieves EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) exceeding 75 dB in the X_band frequency range, even at 200 per cent strain, meeting stringent military and medical standards. It is applicable in wireless communications and Bluetooth signal blocking and as a thermal interface material (TIM). Additionally, we highlight its recyclability using a biodegradable solvent, underscoring its eco_friendly potential. This composite represents a significant advancement in stretchable electronics and EMI shielding, with implications for wearable and bioelectronic applications.

Title: Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology
Authors: Sobhan Hemati, Ghazal Alabtah, Saghir Alfasly, H.R. Tizhoosh
Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.

Title: Separated Inter/Intra-Modal Fusion Prompts for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning
Authors: Sua Jung
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize subtle differences in meaning or the combination of states and objects through the use of known and unknown concepts during training. Existing methods either focused on prompt configuration or on using prompts to tune the pre-trained Vision-Language model. However, these methods faced challenges in accurately identifying subtle differences in meaning or combining states with objects. To jointly eradicate the above issues and construct an efficient and effective CZSL technique, we suggest a method to improve attribute recognition performance by utilizing diverse Prompt Learning with an Inter/Intra-Modality Fusion Synthesizer in scene understanding involving subtle semantic differences and multiple objects.

Title: 6KSFx Synth Dataset
Authors: Nelly Garcia, Joshua Reiss
Abstract: Procedural audio, often referred to as "digital Foley", generates sound from scratch using computational processes. It represents an innovative approach to sound-effects creation. However, the development and adoption of procedural audio has been constrained by a lack of publicly available datasets and models, which hinders evaluation and optimization. To address this important gap, this paper presents a dataset of 6000 synthetic audio samples specifically designed to advance research and development in sound synthesis within 30 sound categories. By offering a description of the diverse synthesis methods used in each sound category and supporting the creation of robust evaluation frameworks, this dataset not only highlights the potential of procedural audio, but also provides a resource for researchers, audio developers, and sound designers. This contribution can accelerate the progress of procedural audio, opening up new possibilities in digital sound design.

Title: Audio Large Language Models Can Be Descriptive Speech Quality Evaluators
Authors: Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Siyin Wang, Helin Wang, Zhehuai Chen, Chao Zhang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: An ideal multimodal agent should be aware of the quality of its input modalities. Recent advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) to incorporate auditory systems for handling various speech-related tasks. However, most audio LLMs remain unaware of the quality of the speech they process. This limitation arises because speech quality evaluation is typically excluded from multi-task training due to the lack of suitable datasets. To address this, we introduce the first natural language-based speech evaluation corpus, generated from authentic human ratings. In addition to the overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS), this corpus offers detailed analysis across multiple dimensions and identifies causes of quality degradation. It also enables descriptive comparisons between two speech samples (A/B tests) with human-like judgment. Leveraging this corpus, we propose an alignment approach with LLM distillation (ALLD) to guide the audio LLM in extracting relevant information from raw speech and generating meaningful responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art regression model in MOS prediction, with a mean square error of 0.17 and an A/B test accuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, the generated responses achieve BLEU scores of 25.8 and 30.2 on two tasks, surpassing the capabilities of task-specific models. This work advances the comprehensive perception of speech signals by audio LLMs, contributing to the development of real-world auditory and sensory intelligent agents.

Title: Compact Neural TTS Voices for Accessibility
Authors: Kunal Jain, Eoin Murphy, Deepanshu Gupta, Jonathan Dyke, Saumya Shah, Vasilieios Tsiaras, Petko Petkov, Alistair Conkie
Abstract: Contemporary text-to-speech solutions for accessibility applications can typically be classified into two categories: (i) device-based statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) or unit selection (USEL) and (ii) cloud-based neural TTS. SPSS and USEL offer low latency and low disk footprint at the expense of naturalness and audio quality. Cloud-based neural TTS systems provide significantly better audio quality and naturalness but regress in terms of latency and responsiveness, rendering these impractical for real-world applications. More recently, neural TTS models were made deployable to run on handheld devices. Nevertheless, latency remains higher than SPSS and USEL, while disk footprint prohibits pre-installation for multiple voices at once. In this work, we describe a high-quality compact neural TTS system achieving latency on the order of 15 ms with low disk footprint. The proposed solution is capable of running on low-power devices.

Title: A Model-Free Data-Driven Algorithm for Continuous-Time Control
Authors: Sean R. Bowerfind, Matthew R. Kirchner, Gary A. Hewer, D. Reed Robinson, Paula Chen, Alireza Farahmandi, Katia Estabridis
Abstract: Presented is an algorithm to synthesize an infinite-horizon LQR optimal feedback controller for continuous-time systems. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics, but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of (possibly suboptimal) input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along an arbitrary trajectory. This paper presents the derivation as well as shows examples applied to both linear and nonlinear systems inspired by air vehicles.

Title: Remote State Estimation over a Wearing Channel: Information Freshness vs. Channel Aging
Authors: Jiping Luo, George Stamatakis, Osvaldo Simeone, Nikolaos Pappas
Abstract: We study the remote estimation of a linear Gaussian system over a nonstationary channel that wears out over time and with every use. The sensor can either transmit a fresh measurement in the current time slot, restore the channel quality at the cost of downtime, or remain silent. More frequent transmissions yield accurate estimates but incur significant wear on the channel. Renewing the channel too often improves channel conditions but results in poor estimation quality. What is the optimal timing to transmit measurements and restore the channel? We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and show the monotonicity properties of an optimal policy. A structured policy iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal policy.

Title: Hybrid Channel- and Coding-Based Challenge-Response Physical-Layer Authentication
Authors: Laura Crosara, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Stefano Tomasin
Abstract: This letter proposes a new physical layer authentication mechanism operating at the physical layer of a communication system where the receiver has partial control of the channel conditions (e.g., using an intelligent reflecting surface). We aim to exploit both instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and a secret shared key for authentication. This is achieved by both transmitting an identifying key by wiretap coding (to conceal the key from the attacker) and checking that the instantaneous CSI corresponds to the channel configuration randomly selected by the receiver. We investigate the trade-off between the pilot signals used for CSI estimation and the coding rate (or key length) to improve the overall security of the authentication procedure.

Title: SemML: Enhancing Automata-Theoretic LTL Synthesis with Machine Learning
Authors: Jan Kretinsky, Tobias Meggendorfer, Maximilian Prokop, Ashkan Zarkhah
Abstract: Synthesizing a reactive system from specifications given in linear temporal logic (LTL) is a classical problem, finding its applications in safety-critical systems design. We present our tool SemML, which won this year's LTL realizability tracks of SYNTCOMP, after years of domination by Strix. While both tools are based on the automata-theoretic approach, ours relies heavily on (i) Semantic labelling, additional information of logical nature, coming from recent LTL-to-automata translations and decorating the resulting parity game, and (ii) Machine Learning approaches turning this information into a guidance oracle for on-the-fly exploration of the parity game (whence the name SemML). Our tool fills the missing gaps of previous suggestions to use such an oracle and provides an efficeint implementation with additional algorithmic improvements. We evaluate SemML both on the entire set of SYNTCOMP as well as a synthetic data set, compare it to Strix, and analyze the advantages and limitations. As SemML solves more instances on SYNTCOMP and does so significantly faster on larger instances, this demonstrates for the first time that machine-learning-aided approaches can out-perform state-of-the-art tools in real LTL synthesis.

Title: Music2Latent2: Audio Compression with Summary Embeddings and Autoregressive Decoding
Authors: Marco Pasini, Stefan Lattner, George Fazekas
Abstract: Efficiently compressing high-dimensional audio signals into a compact and informative latent space is crucial for various tasks, including generative modeling and music information retrieval (MIR). Existing audio autoencoders, however, often struggle to achieve high compression ratios while preserving audio fidelity and facilitating efficient downstream applications. We introduce Music2Latent2, a novel audio autoencoder that addresses these limitations by leveraging consistency models and a novel approach to representation learning based on unordered latent embeddings, which we call summary embeddings. Unlike conventional methods that encode local audio features into ordered sequences, Music2Latent2 compresses audio signals into sets of summary embeddings, where each embedding can capture distinct global features of the input sample. This enables to achieve higher reconstruction quality at the same compression ratio. To handle arbitrary audio lengths, Music2Latent2 employs an autoregressive consistency model trained on two consecutive audio chunks with causal masking, ensuring coherent reconstruction across segment boundaries. Additionally, we propose a novel two-step decoding procedure that leverages the denoising capabilities of consistency models to further refine the generated audio at no additional cost. Our experiments demonstrate that Music2Latent2 outperforms existing continuous audio autoencoders regarding audio quality and performance on downstream tasks. Music2Latent2 paves the way for new possibilities in audio compression.

Title: VoicePrompter: Robust Zero-Shot Voice Conversion with Voice Prompt and Conditional Flow Matching
Authors: Ha-Yeong Choi, Jaehan Park
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in recent voice conversion (VC) systems, enhancing speaker similarity in zero-shot scenarios remains challenging. This challenge arises from the difficulty of generalizing and adapting speaker characteristics in speech within zero-shot environments, which is further complicated by mismatch between the training and inference processes. To address these challenges, we propose VoicePrompter, a robust zero-shot VC model that leverages in-context learning with voice prompts. VoicePrompter is composed of (1) a factorization method that disentangles speech components and (2) a DiT-based conditional flow matching (CFM) decoder that conditions on these factorized features and voice prompts. Additionally, (3) latent mixup is used to enhance in-context learning by combining various speaker features. This approach improves speaker similarity and naturalness in zero-shot VC by applying mixup to latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that VoicePrompter outperforms existing zero-shot VC systems in terms of speaker similarity, speech intelligibility, and audio quality.

Title: Cross-lingual Embedding Clustering for Hierarchical Softmax in Low-Resource Multilingual Speech Recognition
Authors: Zhengdong Yang, Qianying Liu, Sheng Li, Fei Cheng, Chenhui Chu
Abstract: We present a novel approach centered on the decoding stage of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) that enhances multilingual performance, especially for low-resource languages. It utilizes a cross-lingual embedding clustering method to construct a hierarchical Softmax (H-Softmax) decoder, which enables similar tokens across different languages to share similar decoder representations. It addresses the limitations of the previous Huffman-based H-Softmax method, which relied on shallow features in token similarity assessments. Through experiments on a downsampled dataset of 15 languages, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving low-resource multilingual ASR accuracy.

Title: A computational loudness model for electrical stimulation with cochlear implants
Authors: Franklin Alvarez, Yixuan Zhang, Daniel Kipping, Waldo Nogueira
Abstract: Cochlear implants (CIs) are devices that restore the sense of hearing in people with severe sensorineural hearing loss. An electrode array inserted in the cochlea bypasses the natural transducer mechanism that transforms mechanical sound waves into neural activity by artificially stimulating the auditory nerve fibers with electrical pulses. The perception of sounds is possible because the brain extracts features from this neural activity, and loudness is among the most fundamental perceptual features. A computational model that uses a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the peripheral auditory system of CI users was developed to predict categorical loudness from the simulated peripheral neural activity. In contrast, current state-of-the-art computational loudness models predict loudness from the electrical pulses with minimal parametrization of the electrode-nerve interface. In the proposed model, the spikes produced in a population of auditory nerve fibers were grouped by cochlear places, a physiological representation of the auditory filters in psychoacoustics, to be transformed into loudness contribution. Then, a loudness index was obtained with a spatiotemporal integration over this loudness contribution. This index served to define the simulated threshold of hearing (THL) and most comfortable loudness (MCL) levels resembling the growth function in CI users. The performance of real CI users in loudness summation experiments was also used to validate the computational model. These experiments studied the effect of stimulation rate, electrode separation and amplitude modulation. The proposed model provides a new set of perceptual features that can be used in computational frameworks for CIs and narrows the gap between simulations and the human peripheral neural activity.

Title: Efficient Stochastic Polar Decoder With Correlated Stochastic Computing
Authors: Jiaxing Li, Shuwen Zhang, Zhisong Bie
Abstract: Polar codes have gained significant attention in channel coding for their ability to approach the capacity of binary input discrete memoryless channels (B-DMCs), thanks to their reliability and efficiency in transmission. However, existing decoders often struggle to balance hardware area and performance. Stochastic computing offers a way to simplify circuits, and previous work has implemented decoding using this approach. A common issue with these methods is performance degradation caused by the introduction of correlation. This paper presents an Efficient Correlated Stochastic Polar Decoder (ECS-PD) that fundamentally addresses the issue of the `hold-state', preventing it from increasing as correlation computation progresses. We propose two optimization strategies aimed at reducing iteration latency, increasing throughput, and simplifying the circuit to improve hardware efficiency. The optimization can reduce the number of iterations by 25.2% at $E_b/N_0$ = 3 dB. Compared to other efficient designs, the proposed ECS-PD achieves higher throughput and is 2.7 times more hardware-efficient than the min-sum decoder.

Title: Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders
Authors: Pallavi Sharma, Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero, Bogdan Bogdan, Adrian-Dumitru Ciotec, Laura Vasilie, Henning Wessels, Matteo Skull
Abstract: This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk from a given torque demand, addressing the limitations of sparse real-world datasets. Specifically, we implement unconditional and conditional VAEs to generate jerk signals that integrate features from different drivetrain scenarios. The VAEs are trained on experimental data collected from two variants of a fully electric SUV, which differ in maximum torque delivery and drivetrain configuration. New meaningful jerk signals are generated within an engineering context through the interpretation of the VAE's latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs. We show that VAEs bypass the need for exhaustive manual system parametrization while maintaining physical plausibility by conditioning data generation on specific inputs.

Title: Inferring Implicit Goals Across Differing Task Models
Authors: Silvia Tulli, Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou, Mohamed Chetouani, Sarath Sreedharan
Abstract: One of the significant challenges to generating value-aligned behavior is to not only account for the specified user objectives but also any implicit or unspecified user requirements. The existence of such implicit requirements could be particularly common in settings where the user's understanding of the task model may differ from the agent's estimate of the model. Under this scenario, the user may incorrectly expect some agent behavior to be inevitable or guaranteed. This paper addresses such expectation mismatch in the presence of differing models by capturing the possibility of unspecified user subgoal in the context of a task captured as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and querying for it as required. Our method identifies bottleneck states and uses them as candidates for potential implicit subgoals. We then introduce a querying strategy that will generate the minimal number of queries required to identify a policy guaranteed to achieve the underlying goal. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in inferring and achieving unstated goals across various tasks.

Title: Analysis of the navigation of magnetic microrobots through cerebral bifurcations
Authors: Pedro G. Alves, Maria Pinto, Rosa Moreira, Derick Sivakumaran, Fabian C. Landers, Maria Guix, Bradley J. Nelson, Andreas D. Flouris, Salvador Pané, Josep Puigmartí-Luis, Tiago Sotto Mayor
Abstract: Local administration of thrombolytics in ischemic stroke could accelerate clot lysis and the ensuing reperfusion while minimizing the side effects of systemic administration. Medical microrobots could be injected into the bloodstream and magnetically navigated to the clot for administering the drugs directly to the target. The magnetic manipulation required to navigate medical microrobots will depend on various parameters such as the microrobots size, the blood velocity, and the imposed magnetic field gradients. Numerical simulation was used to study the motion of magnetically controlled microrobots flowing through representative cerebral bifurcations, for predicting the magnetic gradients required to navigate the microrobots from the injection point until the target location. Upon thorough validation of the model against several independent analytical and experimental results, the model was used to generate maps and a predictive equation providing quantitative information on the required magnetic gradients, for different scenarios. The developed maps and predictive equation are crucial to inform the design, operation and optimization of magnetic navigation systems for healthcare applications.

Title: SafePR: Unified Approach for Safe Parallel Robots by Contact Detection and Reaction with Redundancy Resolution
Authors: Aran Mohammad, Tim-Lukas Habich, Thomas Seel, Moritz Schappler
Abstract: Fast and safe motion is crucial for the successful deployment of physically interactive robots. Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid type-II singularities and self-collisions. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.

Title: acoupi: An Open-Source Python Framework for Deploying Bioacoustic AI Models on Edge Devices
Authors: Aude Vuilliomenet, Santiago Martínez Balvanera, Oisin Mac Aodha, Kate E. Jones, Duncan Wilson
Abstract: 1. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an essential tool for biodiversity monitoring. Traditional PAM systems require manual data offloading and impose substantial demands on storage and computing infrastructure. The combination of on-device AI-based processing and network connectivity enables local data analysis and transmission of only relevant information, greatly reducing storage needs. However, programming these devices for robust operation is challenging, requiring expertise in embedded systems and software engineering. Despite the increase in AI-based models for bioacoustics, their full potential remains unrealized without accessible tools to deploy them on custom hardware and tailor device behaviour to specific monitoring goals. 2. To address this challenge, we develop acoupi, an open-source Python framework that simplifies the creation and deployment of smart bioacoustic devices. acoupi integrates audio recording, AI-based data processing, data management, and real-time wireless messaging into a unified and configurable framework. By modularising key elements of the bioacoustic monitoring workflow, acoupi allows users to easily customise, extend, or select specific components to fit their unique monitoring needs. 3. We demonstrate the flexibility of acoupi by integrating two bioacoustic classifiers: BirdNET, for the classification of bird species, and BatDetect2, for the classification of UK bat species. We test the reliability of acoupi over a month-long deployment of two acoupi-powered devices in a UK urban park. 4. acoupi can be deployed on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi and can be customised for various applications. acoupi standardised framework and simplified tools facilitate the adoption of AI-powered PAM systems for researchers and conservationists. acoupi is on GitHub at this https URL.

Title: Private Information Retrieval on Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage
Authors: Shreya Meel, Xiangliang Kong, Thomas Jacob Maranzatto, Itzhak Tamo, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.

Title: Solve the General Constrained Optimal Control Problem with Common Integration Method
Authors: Sheng Zhang, Jin-Mei Gao
Abstract: Computation of general state- and/or control-constrained Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) is difficult for various constraints, especially the intractable path constraint. For such problems, the theoretical convergence of numerical algorithms is usually not guaranteed, and the right solution may not be successfully obtained. With the recently proposed Variation Evolving Method (VEM), the evolution equations, which guarantee the convergence towards the optimal solution in theory even for the general constrained OCPs, are derived. In particular, the costate-free optimality conditions are established. Besides the analytic expressions of the costates and the Lagrange multipliers adjoining the terminal constraint, the integral equation that determines the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multiplier variable is also derived. Upon the work in this paper, the general constrained OCPs may be transformed to the Initial-value Problems (IVPs) to be solved, with common Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) numerical integration methods.

Title: A Deep Learning-Based Unified Framework for Red Lesions Detection on Retinal Fundus Images
Authors: Norah Asiri, Muhammad Hussain, Fadwa Al Adel
Abstract: Red-lesions, microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HMs), are the early signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The automatic detection of MAs and HMs on retinal fundus images is a challenging task. Most of the existing methods detect either only MAs or only HMs because of the difference in their texture, sizes, and morphology. Though some methods detect both MAs and HMs, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality of shape and colors features and fail to detect all shape variations of HMs such as flame-shaped. Leveraging the progress in deep learning, we proposed a two-stream red lesions detection system dealing simultaneously with small and large red lesions. For this system, we introduced a new ROIs candidates generation method for large red lesions on fundus images; it is based on blood vessel segmentation and morphological operations, and reduces the computational complexity, and enhances the detection accuracy by generating a small number of potential candidates. For detection, we proposed a framework with two streams. We used pretrained VGGNet as a backbone model and carried out several extensive experiments to tune it for vessels segmentation and candidates generation, and finally learning the appropriate mapping, which yields better detection of the red lesions comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results validated the effectiveness of the system in the detection of both MAs and HMs; it yields higher performance for per lesion detection; its sensitivity equals 0.8589 and good FROC score under 8 FPIs on DiaretDB1-MA reports FROC=0.7518, and with SN=0.7552 and good FROC score under 2,4and 8 FPIs on DiaretDB1-HM, and SN=0.8157 on e-ophtha with overall FROC=0.4537 and on ROCh dataset with FROC=0.3461 which is higher than the state-of-the art methods. For DR screening, the system performs well with good AUC on DiaretDB1-MA, DiaretDB1-HM, and e-ophtha datasets.

Abstract: A stochastic Model Predictive Control strategy for control systems with communication networks between the sensor node and the controller and between the controller and the actuator node is proposed. Data packets are subject to random delays and packet loss is possible; acknowledgments for received packets are not provided. The expected value of a quadratic cost is minimized subject to linear constraints; the set of all initial states for which the resulting optimization problem is guaranteed to be feasible is provided. The state vector of the controlled plant is shown to converge to zero with probability one.

Title: Fast Word Error Rate Estimation Using Self-Supervised Representations for Speech and Text
Authors: Chanho Park, Chengsong Lu, Mingjie Chen, Thomas Hain
Abstract: Word error rate (WER) estimation aims to evaluate the quality of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system's output without requiring ground-truth labels. This task has gained increasing attention as advanced ASR systems are trained on large amounts of data. In this context, the computational efficiency of a WER estimator becomes essential in practice. However, previous works have not prioritised this aspect. In this paper, a Fast estimator for WER (Fe-WER) is introduced, utilizing average pooling over self-supervised learning representations for speech and text. Our results demonstrate that Fe-WER outperformed a baseline relatively by 14.10% in root mean square error and 1.22% in Pearson correlation coefficient on Ted-Lium3. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the distributions of target WER and WER estimates was conducted, including an examination of the average values per speaker. Lastly, the inference speed was approximately 3.4 times faster in the real-time factor.

Title: Leader-Follower Density Control of Spatial Dynamics in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Gian Carlo Maffettone, Alain Boldini, Maurizio Porfiri, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on a group of leader agents that interact with them. Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a leaders' density feedback. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.

Title: Optimization of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access with Integrated Sensing and Backscatter Communication
Authors: Diluka Galappaththige, Shayan Zargari, Chintha Tellambura, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: An integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system is introduced herein. This system features a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) that seamlessly merges sensing with backscatter communication and supports multiple users. Multiple access (MA) for the user is provided by employing rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA, unlike other classical orthogonal and non-orthogonal MA schemes, splits messages into common and private streams. With RSMA, the set of common rate forms can be optimized to reduce interference. Optimized formulas are thus derived for communication rates for users, tags, and the BS's sensing rate, with the primary goal of enhancing the transmission efficiency of the BS. The optimization task involves minimizing the BS's overall transmission power by jointly optimizing the BS's beamforming vectors, the tag reflection coefficients, and user common rates. The alternating optimization method is employed to address this challenge. Concrete solutions are provided for the received beamformers, and semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization techniques are adopted for transmit beamformers and reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, the proposed RSMA-assisted ISABC system achieves a 350% communication rate boost over a nonorthogonal multiple access-assisted ISABC, with only a 24% increase in transmit power, leveraging ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS.

Title: Adaptive Deep Neural Network-Based Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Hannah M. Sweatland, Omkar Sudhir Patil, Warren E. Dixon
Abstract: Safety constraints of nonlinear control systems are commonly enforced through the use of control barrier functions (CBFs). Uncertainties in the dynamic model can disrupt forward invariance guarantees or cause the state to be restricted to an overly conservative subset of the safe set. In this paper, adaptive deep neural networks (DNNs) are combined with CBFs to produce a family of controllers that ensure safety while learning the system's dynamics in real-time without the requirement for pre-training. By basing the least squares adaptation law on a state derivative estimator-based identification error, the DNN parameter estimation error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The convergent bound on the parameter estimation error is then used to formulate CBF-constraints in an optimization-based controller to guarantee safety despite model uncertainty. Furthermore, the developed method is extended for use under intermittent loss of state-feedback. A switched systems analysis for CBFs is provided with a maximum dwell-time condition during which the feedback can be unavailable. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the ability of the developed method to ensure safety in an adaptive cruise control problem and when feedback is lost, unlike baseline methods. Results show improved performance compared to baseline methods and demonstrate the ability of the developed method to ensure safety in feedback-denied environments.

Title: Doppler Power Spectrum in Channels with von Mises-Fisher Distribution of Scatterers
Authors: Kenan Turbic, Martin Kasparick, Slawomir Stanczak
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical analysis of the Doppler spectrum in von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering channels. A simple closed-form expression for the Doppler spectrum is derived and used to investigate the impact of the vMF scattering parameters, i.e., the mean direction and the degree of concentration of scatterers. The spectrum is observed to exhibit exponential behavior for mobile antenna motion parallel to the mean direction of scatterers, while conforming to a Gaussian-like shape for the perpendicular motion. The validity of the obtained results is verified by comparison against the results of Monte Carlo simulations, where an exact match is observed.

Title: Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints
Authors: Meiyi Zhu, Matteo Zecchin, Sangwoo Park, Caili Guo, Chunyan Feng, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.

Title: A large synthetic dataset for machine learning applications in power transmission grids
Authors: Marc Gillioz, Guillaume Dubuis, Philippe Jacquod
Abstract: With the ongoing energy transition, power grids are evolving fast. They operate more and more often close to their technical limit, under more and more volatile conditions. Fast, essentially real-time computational approaches to evaluate their operational safety, stability and reliability are therefore highly desirable. Machine Learning methods have been advocated to solve this challenge, however they are heavy consumers of training and testing data, while historical operational data for real-world power grids are hard if not impossible to access. This manuscript presents a large synthetic dataset of power injections in an electric transmission grid model of continental Europe, and describes the algorithm developed for its generation. The method allows one to generate arbitrarily large time series from the knowledge of the grid -- the admittance of its lines as well as the location, type and capacity of its power generators -- and aggregated power consumption data, such as the national load data given by ENTSO-E. The obtained datasets are statistically validated against real-world data.

Title: Cyber-physical WebAssembly: Secure Hardware Interfaces and Pluggable Drivers
Authors: Michiel Van Kenhove, Maximilian Seidler, Friedrich Vandenberghe, Warre Dujardin, Wouter Hennen, Arne Vogel, Merlijn Sebrechts, Tom Goethals, Filip De Turck, Bruno Volckaert
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and embedded devices in the past decade has introduced numerous challenges in terms of security and configuration management. Simultaneously, advances in cloud-native development practices have greatly enhanced the development experience and facilitated quicker updates, thereby enhancing application security. However, applying these advances to IoT, edge, and embedded devices remains a complex task, primarily due to the heterogeneous environments and the need to support devices with extended lifespans. WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) has emerged as a promising technology to bridge this gap. As WebAssembly becomes more popular on IoT, edge, and embedded devices, there is a growing demand for hardware interface support in WebAssembly programs. This work presents WASI proposals and proof-of-concept implementations to enable hardware interaction with I2C and USB, which are two commonly used protocols in IoT, directly from WebAssembly applications. This is achieved by running the device drivers within WebAssembly as well. A thorough evaluation of the proof of concepts shows that WASI-USB introduces a minimal overhead of at most 8% compared to native operating system USB APIs. However, the results show that runtime initialization overhead can be significant in low-latency applications.

Title: ELFATT: Efficient Linear Fast Attention for Vision Transformers
Authors: Chong Wu, Maolin Che, Renjie Xu, Zhuoheng Ran, Hong Yan
Abstract: The attention mechanism is the key to the success of transformers in different machine learning tasks. However, the quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length of the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism becomes the major bottleneck for the application of long sequence tasks, such as vision tasks. Although various efficient linear attention mechanisms have been proposed, they need to sacrifice performance to achieve high efficiency. What's more, memory-efficient methods, such as FlashAttention-1-3, still have quadratic computation complexity which can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient linear fast attention (ELFATT) mechanism to achieve low memory input/output operations, linear computational complexity, and high performance at the same time. ELFATT offers 4-7x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism in high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. ELFATT is FlashAttention friendly. Using FlashAttention-2 acceleration, ELFATT still offers 2-3x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism on high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. Even on edge GPUs, ELFATT still offers 1.6x to 2.0x speedups compared to state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in various power modes from 5W to 60W. Furthermore, ELFATT can be used to enhance and accelerate diffusion tasks directly without training.

Title: A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary
Authors: Bastien Giraud, Lola Charles, Agnes Marjorie Nakiganda, Johanna Vorwerk, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. However, conventional DSA approaches are becoming intractable for future power systems, driving interest in more computationally efficient data-driven methods. Efficient dataset generation is a cornerstone of these methods. While importance and generic sampling techniques often focus on operating points near the system's security boundary, systematic methods for sampling in this region remain scarce. Furthermore, the impact of sampling near the security boundary on the performance of data-driven DSA methods has yet to be established. This paper highlights the critical role of accurately capturing security boundaries for effective security assessment. As such, we propose a novel method for generating a high number of samples close to the security boundary, considering both AC feasibility and small-signal stability. Case studies on the PGLib-OPF 39-bus and PGLib-OPF 162-bus systems demonstrate the importance of including boundary-adjacent operating points in training datasets while maintaining a balanced distribution of secure and insecure points.

Title: Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content
Authors: Luca Surace, Jorge Condor, Piotr Didyk
Abstract: Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.

Title: Impact of Lead Time on Aggregate EV Flexibility for Congestion Management Services
Authors: Nanda Kishor Panda, Peter Palensky, Simon H. Tindemans
Abstract: Increased electrification of energy end-usage can lead to network congestion during periods of high consumption. Flexibility of loads, such as aggregate smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs), is increasingly leveraged to manage grid congestion through various market-based mechanisms. Under such an arrangement, this paper quantifies the effect of lead time on the aggregate flexibility of EV fleets. Simulations using real-world charging transactions spanning over different categories of charging stations are performed for two flexibility products (redispatch and capacity limitations) when offered along with different business-as-usual (BAU) schedules. Results show that the variation of tradable flexibility depends mainly on the BAU schedules, the duration of the requested flexibility, and its start time. Further, the implication of these flexibility products on the average energy costs and emissions is also studied for different cases. Simulations show that bidirectional (V2G) charging outperforms unidirectional smart charging in all cases.

Title: Wideband Beamforming for RIS Assisted Near-Field Communications
Authors: Ji Wang, Jian Xiao, Yixuan Zou, Wenwu Xie, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD) units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS (SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E beamforming models without explicit channel state information are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy consumption and hardware cost.

Title: Neural variational Data Assimilation with Uncertainty Quantification using SPDE priors
Authors: Maxime Beauchamp, Ronan Fablet, Simon Benaichouche, Pierre Tandeo, Nicolas Desassis, Bertrand Chapron
Abstract: The spatio-temporal interpolation of large geophysical datasets has historically been addressed by Optimal Interpolation (OI) and more sophisticated equation-based or data-driven Data Assimilation (DA) techniques. Recent advances in the deep learning community enables to address the interpolation problem through a neural architecture incorporating a variational data assimilation framework. The reconstruction task is seen as a joint learning problem of the prior involved in the variational inner cost, seen as a projection operator of the state, and the gradient-based minimization of the latter. Both prior models and solvers are stated as neural networks with automatic differentiation which can be trained by minimizing a loss function, typically the mean squared error between some ground truth and the reconstruction. Such a strategy turns out to be very efficient to improve the mean state estimation, but still needs complementary developments to quantify its related uncertainty. In this work, we use the theory of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) and Gaussian Processes (GP) to estimate both space-and time-varying covariance of the state. Our neural variational scheme is modified to embed an augmented state formulation with both state and SPDE parametrization to estimate. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework on a spatio-temporal GP driven by diffusion-based anisotropies and on realistic Sea Surface Height (SSH) datasets. We show how our solution reaches the OI baseline in the Gaussian case. For nonlinear dynamics, as almost always stated in DA, our solution outperforms OI, while allowing for fast and interpretable online parameter estimation.

Title: Closed-loop Multi-step Planning
Authors: Giulia Lafratta, Bernd Porr, Christopher Chandler, Alice Miller
Abstract: Living organisms interact with their surroundings in a closed-loop fashion, where sensory inputs dictate the initiation and termination of behaviours. Even simple animals are able to develop and execute complex plans, which has not yet been replicated in robotics using pure closed-loop input control. We propose a solution to this problem by defining a set of discrete and temporary closed-loop controllers, called ``Tasks'', each representing a closed-loop behaviour. We further introduce a supervisory module which has an innate understanding of physics and causality, through which it can simulate the execution of Task sequences over time and store the results in a model of the environment. On the basis of this model, plans can be made by chaining temporary closed-loop controllers. Our proposed framework was implemented for a real robot and tested in two scenarios as proof of concept.

Title: Competency-Aware Planning for Probabilistically Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty
Authors: Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.

Title: Spatial Adaptation Layer: Interpretable Domain Adaptation For Biosignal Sensor Array Applications
Authors: Joao Pereira, Michael Alummoottil, Dimitrios Halatsis, Dario Farina
Abstract: Machine learning offers promising methods for processing signals recorded with wearable devices such as surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, in these applications, despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be applied to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperformed standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study showed that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements.

Title: Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems
Authors: Bryan Glaz
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified man-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.

Title: LHGNN: Local-Higher Order Graph Neural Networks For Audio Classification and Tagging
Authors: Shubhr Singh, Emmanouil Benetos, Huy Phan, Dan Stowell
Abstract: Transformers have set new benchmarks in audio processing tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns and dependencies within audio data. However, their focus on pairwise interactions limits their ability to process the higher-order relations essential for identifying distinct audio objects. To address this limitation, this work introduces the Local- Higher Order Graph Neural Network (LHGNN), a graph based model that enhances feature understanding by integrating local neighbourhood information with higher-order data from Fuzzy C-Means clusters, thereby capturing a broader spectrum of audio relationships. Evaluation of the model on three publicly available audio datasets shows that it outperforms Transformer-based models across all benchmarks while operating with substantially fewer parameters. Moreover, LHGNN demonstrates a distinct advantage in scenarios lacking ImageNet pretraining, establishing its effectiveness and efficiency in environments where extensive pretraining data is unavailable.

Authors: Zijiang Yang, Meishu Song, Xin Jing, Haojie Zhang, Kun Qian, Bin Hu, Kota Tamada, Toru Takumi, Björn W. Schuller, Yoshiharu Yamamoto
Abstract: The Mice Autism Detection via Ultrasound Vocalization (MADUV) Challenge introduces the first INTERSPEECH challenge focused on detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mice through their vocalizations. Participants are tasked with developing models to automatically classify mice as either wild-type or ASD models based on recordings with a high sampling rate. Our baseline system employs a simple CNN-based classification using three different spectrogram features. Results demonstrate the feasibility of automated ASD detection, with the considered audible-range features achieving the best performance (UAR of 0.600 for segment-level and 0.625 for subject-level classification). This challenge bridges speech technology and biomedical research, offering opportunities to advance our understanding of ASD models through machine learning approaches. The findings suggest promising directions for vocalization analysis and highlight the potential value of audible and ultrasound vocalizations in ASD detection.

Title: Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement
Authors: Anzheng Tang, Jun-Bo Wang, Yijin Pan, Cheng Zeng, Yijian Chen, Hongkang Yu, Ming Xiao, Rodrigo C. de Lamare, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.
