Title: SCENE: Semantic-aware Codec Enhancement with Neural Embeddings
Authors: Han-Yu Lin, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee
Abstract: Compression artifacts from standard video codecs often degrade perceptual quality. We propose a lightweight, semantic-aware pre-processing framework that enhances perceptual fidelity by selectively addressing these distortions. Our method integrates semantic embeddings from a vision-language model into an efficient convolutional architecture, prioritizing the preservation of perceptually significant structures. The model is trained end-to-end with a differentiable codec proxy, enabling it to mitigate artifacts from various standard codecs without modifying the existing video pipeline. During inference, the codec proxy is discarded, and SCENE operates as a standalone pre-processor, enabling real-time performance. Experiments on high-resolution benchmarks show improved performance over baselines in both objective (MS-SSIM) and perceptual (VMAF) metrics, with notable gains in preserving detailed textures within salient regions. Our results show that semantic-guided, codec-aware pre-processing is an effective approach for enhancing compressed video streams.

Title: A Survey on Semantic Communication for Vision: Categories, Frameworks, Enabling Techniques, and Applications
Authors: Runze Cheng, Yao Sun, Ahmad Taha, Xuesong Liu, David Flynn, Muhammad Ali Imran
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) emerges as a transformative paradigm for traffic-intensive visual data transmission, shifting focus from raw data to meaningful content transmission and relieving the increasing pressure on communication resources. However, to achieve SemCom, challenges are faced in accurate semantic quantization for visual data, robust semantic extraction and reconstruction under diverse tasks and goals, transceiver coordination with effective knowledge utilization, and adaptation to unpredictable wireless communication environments. In this paper, we present a systematic review of SemCom for visual data transmission (SemCom-Vision), wherein an interdisciplinary analysis integrating computer vision (CV) and communication engineering is conducted to provide comprehensive guidelines for the machine learning (ML)-empowered SemCom-Vision design. Specifically, this survey first elucidates the basics and key concepts of SemCom. Then, we introduce a novel classification perspective to categorize existing SemCom-Vision approaches as semantic preservation communication (SPC), semantic expansion communication (SEC), and semantic refinement communication (SRC) based on communication goals interpreted through semantic quantization schemes. Moreover, this survey articulates the ML-based encoder-decoder models and training algorithms for each SemCom-Vision category, followed by knowledge structure and utilization strategies. Finally, we discuss potential SemCom-Vision applications.

Title: Compressive Beam-Pattern-Aware Near-field Beam Training via Total Variation Denoising
Authors: Zijun Wang, Maria Nivetha A, Ye Hu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays envisioned for 6G incurs near-field effect, where steering vector depends on angles and range simultaneously. Polar-domain near-field codebooks can focus energy accurately but incur extra two-dimensional sweeping overhead; compressed-sensing (CS) approaches with Gaussian-masked DFT sensing offer a lower-overhead alternative. This letter revisits near-field beam training using conventional DFT codebooks. Unlike far-field responses that concentrate energy on a few isolated DFT beams, near-field responses produce contiguous, plateau-like energy segments with sharp transitions in the DFT beamspace. Pure LASSO denoising, therefore, tends to over-shrink magnitudes and fragment plateaus. We propose a beam-pattern-preserving beam training scheme for multiple-path scenarios that combines LASSO with a lightweight denoising pipeline: LASSO to suppress small-amplitude noise, followed by total variation (TV) to maintain plateau levels and edge sharpness. The two proximal steps require no near-field codebook design. Simulations with Gaussian pilots show consistent NMSE and cosine-similarity gains over least squares and LASSO at the same pilot budget.

Title: Brain-Informed Speech Separation for Cochlear Implants
Authors: Tom Gajecki, Jonas Althoff, Waldo Nogueira
Abstract: We propose a brain-informed speech separation method for cochlear implants (CIs) that uses electroencephalography (EEG)-derived attention cues to guide enhancement toward the attended speaker. An attention-guided network fuses audio mixtures with EEG features through a lightweight fusion layer, producing attended-source electrodograms for CI stimulation while resolving the label-permutation ambiguity of audio-only separators. Robustness to degraded attention cues is improved with a mixed curriculum that varies cue quality during training, yielding stable gains even when EEG-speech correlation is moderate. In multi-talker conditions, the model achieves higher signal-to-interference ratio improvements than an audio-only electrodogram baseline while remaining slightly smaller (167k vs. 171k parameters). With 2 ms algorithmic latency and comparable cost, the approach highlights the promise of coupling auditory and neural cues for cognitively adaptive CI processing.

Title: Dual-Diode Unified SWIPT for High Data Rates with Adaptive Detection
Authors: Zulqarnain Bin Ashraf, Triantafyllos Mavrovoltsos, Constantinos Psomas, Ioannis Krikidis, Besma Smida
Abstract: Due to their low-complexity and energy-efficiency, unified simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (U-SWIPT) receivers are especially suitable for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Towards accurately modeling practical operating conditions, in this study, we provide a unified transient framework for a dual-diode U-SWIPT that jointly accounts for diode nonlinearity and capacitor-induced memory effects. The proposed model accurately describes the inherent time dependence of the rectifier, highlighting its fundamental impact on both energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. Based on the provided memory-aware model, we design a low-complexity adaptive detector that learns the nonlinear state transition dynamics and performs decision-directed detection with linear complexity. The proposed detection scheme approaches maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) performance in memory-dominated regimes, while avoiding the exponential search required by classical sequence detection. Overall, these results demonstrate that properly exploiting rectifier memory provides a better tradeoff between data rate and reliability for U-SWIPT receivers.

Title: Sylber 2.0: A Universal Syllable Embedding
Authors: Cheol Jun Cho, Nicholas Lee, Alan W Black, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli
Abstract: Scaling spoken language modeling requires speech tokens that are both efficient and universal. Recent work has proposed syllables as promising speech tokens at low temporal resolution, but existing models are constrained to English and fail to capture sufficient acoustic detail. To address this gap, we present Sylber 2.0, a self-supervised framework for coding speech at the syllable level that enables efficient temporal compression and high-fidelity reconstruction. Sylber 2.0 achieves a very low token frequency around 5 Hz, while retaining both linguistic and acoustic detail across multiple languages and expressive styles. Experiments show that it performs on par with previous models operating on high-frequency baselines. Furthermore, Sylber 2.0 enables efficient TTS modeling which can generate speech with competitive intelligibility and quality with SOTA models using only 72M parameters. Moreover, the universality of Sylber 2.0 provides more effective features for low resource ASR than previous speech coding frameworks. In sum, we establish an effective syllable-level abstraction for general spoken language.

Title: Optimizing Domain-Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning for Clinical Voice-Based Disease Classification
Authors: Weixin Liu, Bowen Qu, Matthew Pontell, Maria Powell, Bradley Malin, Zhijun Yin
Abstract: The human voice is a promising non-invasive digital biomarker, yet deep learning for voice-based health analysis is hindered by data scarcity and domain mismatch, where models pre-trained on general audio fail to capture the subtle pathological features characteristic of clinical voice data. To address these challenges, we investigate domain-adaptive self-supervised learning (SSL) with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and demonstrate that standard configurations are suboptimal for health-related audio. Using the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset, a multi-institutional collection of pathological voices, we systematically examine three performance-critical factors: reconstruction loss (Mean Absolute Error vs. Mean Squared Error), normalization (patch-wise vs. global), and masking (random vs. content-aware). Our optimized design, which combines Mean Absolute Error (MA-Error) loss, patch-wise normalization, and content-aware masking, achieves a Macro F1 of $0.688 \pm 0.009$ (over 10 fine-tuning runs), outperforming a strong out-of-domain SSL baseline pre-trained on large-scale general audio, which has a Macro F1 of $0.663 \pm 0.011$. The results show that MA-Error loss improves robustness and content-aware masking boosts performance by emphasizing information-rich regions. These findings highlight the importance of component-level optimization in data-constrained medical applications that rely on audio data.

Title: Regional Transportation Modeling for Equitable Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Design
Authors: Ismaeel Babur, Jane Macfarlane
Abstract: The widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) holds promise for mitigating emission-related health impacts, particularly for low-income communities disproportionately affected by exposure to traffic-related air pollution. However, designing effective charging infrastructure necessitates a regional modeling approach that accounts for the inherent cross-jurisdictional nature of mobility patterns. This study underscores the importance of regional modeling in optimizing charging station deployment and evaluating the environmental justice implications for equity priority communities. We present a large-scale regional transportation modeling analysis leveraging Mobiliti, a cloud-based platform that employs parallel discrete event simulation to enable rapid computation. Our approach identifies the spatial demand density for charging infrastructure by analyzing over 19 million trips in the San Francisco Bay Area and determining the threshold points where BEVs may require charging across a typical day. By transitioning these trips that originate outside equity priority communities to BEVs, we quantify the potential emission reductions within these vulnerable areas. The regional modeling framework captures the complex interactions between travel behavior, vehicle characteristics, and charging needs, while accounting for the interconnectivity of infrastructure across municipal boundaries. This study demonstrates the critical role of regional modeling in designing equitable BEV charging networks that address environmental justice concerns. The findings inform strategies for deploying charging infrastructure that maximizes accessibility, minimizes range anxiety, and prioritizes the health and well-being of communities disproportionately burdened by transportation emissions.

Title: Modeling of Non-linear Dynamics of Lithium-ion Batteries via Delay-Embedded Dynamic Mode Decomposition
Authors: Khalid Mahmud Labib, Shabbir Ahmed
Abstract: The complex electrochemical behavior of lithium-ion batteries results in non-linear dynamics and appropriate modeling of this non-linear dynamical system is of interest for better management and control. In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.

Title: On the Optimality of Rate Balancing for Max-Min Fair Multicasting
Authors: Sadaf Syed, Wolfgang Utschick, Michael Joham
Abstract: The max-min fair (MMF) multicasting problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we analytically derive the optimal solution to this NP-hard problem and establish the equivalence between rate balancing and the optimal MMF multicasting solution under certain conditions. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a low-complexity algorithm for MMF multicasting that yields closed-form solutions. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while being computationally more efficient.

Title: Class-Aware Permutation-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio for Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scene with Same-Class Sources
Authors: Binh Thien Nguyen, Masahiro Yasuda, Daiki Takeuchi, Daisuke Niizumi, Noboru Harada
Abstract: To advance immersive communication, the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025 Challenge recently introduced Task 4 on Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes (S5). An S5 system takes a multi-channel audio mixture as input and outputs single-channel dry sources along with their corresponding class labels. Although the DCASE 2025 Challenge simplifies the task by constraining class labels in each mixture to be mutually exclusive, real-world mixtures frequently contain multiple sources from the same class. The presence of duplicated labels can significantly degrade the performance of the label-queried source separation (LQSS) model, which is the key component of many existing S5 systems, and can also limit the validity of the official evaluation metric of DCASE 2025 Task 4. To address these issues, we propose a class-aware permutation-invariant loss function that enables the LQSS model to handle queries involving duplicated labels. In addition, we redesign the S5 evaluation metric to eliminate ambiguities caused by these same-class sources. To evaluate the proposed method within the S5 system, we extend the label prediction model to support same-class labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the robustness of the new metric on mixtures both with and without same-class sources.

Title: Superimposed-Pilot OTFS Under Fractional Doppler: Modular End-to-End Learning
Authors: Yushi Lei, Yusha Liu, Guanghui Liu, Lei Wan, Kun Yang
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising candidate to overcome the performance degradation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which are commonly encountered in high-mobility wireless communication scenarios. However, conventional OTFS transceivers rely on multiple separately designed signal-processing modules, whose isolated optimization often limits global optimal performance. To overcome limitations, this paper proposes a modular deep learning (DL) based end-to-end OTFS transceiver framework that consists of trainable and interchangeable neural network (NN) modules, including constellation mapping/demapping, superimposed pilot placement, inverse Zak (IZak)/Zak transforms, and a U-Net-enhanced NN tailored for joint channel estimation and detection (JCED), while explicitly accounting for the impact of the cyclic prefix. This physics-informed modular architecture provides flexibility for integration with conventional OTFS systems and adaptability to different communication configurations. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed design significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and detection reliability, maintaining robustness under integer and fractional Doppler conditions. The results highlight the potential of DL-based end-to-end optimization to enable practical and high-performance OTFS transceivers for next-generation high-mobility networks.

Title: EndoCaver: Handling Fog, Blur and Glare in Endoscopic Images via Joint Deblurring-Segmentation
Authors: Zhuoyu Wu, Wenhui Ou, Pei-Sze Tan, Jiayan Yang, Wenqi Fang, Zheng Wang, Raphaël C.-W. Phan
Abstract: Endoscopic image analysis is vital for colorectal cancer screening, yet real-world conditions often suffer from lens fogging, motion blur, and specular highlights, which severely compromise automated polyp detection. We propose EndoCaver, a lightweight transformer with a unidirectional-guided dual-decoder architecture, enabling joint multi-task capability for image deblurring and segmentation while significantly reducing computational complexity and model parameters. Specifically, it integrates a Global Attention Module (GAM) for cross-scale aggregation, a Deblurring-Segmentation Aligner (DSA) to transfer restoration cues, and a cosine-based scheduler (LoCoS) for stable multi-task optimisation. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG dataset show that EndoCaver achieves 0.922 Dice on clean data and 0.889 under severe image degradation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while reducing model parameters by 90%. These results demonstrate its efficiency and robustness, making it well-suited for on-device clinical deployment. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Approximately Optimal Multi-Stream Quickest Change Detection for Gaussian Streams
Authors: Joshua Kartzman, Calvin Hawkins, Matthew Hale
Abstract: This paper considers the bandit quickest change detection problem in which one stream contains a change-point that shifts its distribution by an unknown amount in an unknown direction. We consider an agent that can observe only a single stream at each time, and the goal of the agent is to detect this change as quickly as possible while controlling for false alarms. We propose an algorithm that combines a decaying-$\epsilon$-greedy stream switching rule with an efficient change-point detection algorithm for unknown post-change means. We provide bounds on the expected detection delay and average run length to false alarm for our algorithm, and based on these results we prove our algorithm is approximately optimal with respect to a commonly used surrogate. This work is the first to provide provable guarantees in this setting without strong assumptions such as a discretized post-change parameter set or a lower bound on the magnitude of change.

Title: Bonnet: Ultra-fast whole-body bone segmentation from CT scans
Authors: Hanjiang Zhu, Pedro Martelleto Rezende, Zhang Yang, Tong Ye, Bruce Z. Gao, Feng Luo, Siyu Huang, Jiancheng Yang
Abstract: This work proposes Bonnet, an ultra-fast sparse-volume pipeline for whole-body bone segmentation from CT scans. Accurate bone segmentation is important for surgical planning and anatomical analysis, but existing 3D voxel-based models such as nnU-Net and STU-Net require heavy computation and often take several minutes per scan, which limits time-critical use. The proposed Bonnet addresses this by integrating a series of novel framework components including HU-based bone thresholding, patch-wise inference with a sparse spconv-based U-Net, and multi-window fusion into a full-volume prediction. Trained on TotalSegmentator and evaluated without additional tuning on RibSeg, CT-Pelvic1K, and CT-Spine1K, Bonnet achieves high Dice across ribs, pelvis, and spine while running in only 2.69 seconds per scan on an RTX A6000. Compared to strong voxel baselines, Bonnet attains a similar accuracy but reduces inference time by roughly 25x on the same hardware and tiling setup. The toolkit and pre-trained models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Training Beyond Convergence: Grokking nnU-Net for Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan MRI
Authors: Mohtady Barakat, Omar Salah, Ahmed Yasser, Mostafa Ahmed, Zahirul Arief, Waleed Khan, Dong Zhang, Aondona Iorumbur, Confidence Raymond, Mohannad Barakat, Noha Magdy
Abstract: Gliomas are placing an increasingly clinical burden on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the region, the median survival for patients remains under two years, and access to diagnostic imaging is extremely limited. These constraints highlight an urgent need for automated tools that can extract the maximum possible information from each available scan, tools that are specifically trained on local data, rather than adapted from high-income settings where conditions are vastly different. We utilize the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Africa 2025 Challenge dataset, an expert annotated collection of glioma MRIs. Our objectives are: (i) establish a strong baseline with nnUNet on this dataset, and (ii) explore whether the celebrated "grokking" phenomenon an abrupt, late training jump from memorization to superior generalization can be triggered to push performance without extra labels. We evaluate two training regimes. The first is a fast, budget-conscious approach that limits optimization to just a few epochs, reflecting the constrained GPU resources typically available in African institutions. Despite this limitation, nnUNet achieves strong Dice scores: 92.3% for whole tumor (WH), 86.6% for tumor core (TC), and 86.3% for enhancing tumor (ET). The second regime extends training well beyond the point of convergence, aiming to trigger a grokking-driven performance leap. With this approach, we were able to achieve grokking and enhanced our results to higher Dice scores: 92.2% for whole tumor (WH), 90.1% for tumor core (TC), and 90.2% for enhancing tumor (ET).

Title: SORIS: A Self-Organized Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Architecture for Wireless Communications
Authors: Evangelos Koutsonas, Alexandros-Apostolos A. Boulogeorgos, Stylianos E. Trevlakis, George C. Alexandropoulos, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, a new reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) hardware architecture, called self-organized RIS (SORIS), is proposed. The architecture incorporates a microcontroller connected to a single-antenna receiver operating at the same frequency as the RIS unit elements, operating either in transmission or reflection mode. The transmitting RIS elements enable the low latency estimation of both the incoming and outcoming channels at the microcontroller's side. In addition, a machine learning approach for estimating the incoming and outcoming channels involving the remaining RIS elements operating in reflection mode is devised. Specifically, by appropriately selecting a small number of elements in transmission mode, and based on the channel reciprocity principle, the respective channel coefficients are first estimated, which are then fed to a low-complexity neural network that, leveraging spatial channel correlation over RIS elements, returns predictions of the channel coefficients referring to the rest of elements. In this way, the SORIS microcontroller acquires channel state information, and accordingly reconfigures the panel's metamaterials to assist data communication between a transmitter and a receiver, without the need for separate connections with them. Moreover, the impact of channel estimation on the proposed solution, and a detailed complexity analysis for the used model, as well as a wiring density and control signaling analysis, is performed. The feasibility and efficacy of the proposed self-organized RIS design and operation are verified by Monte Carlo simulations, providing useful guidelines on the selection of the RIS elements for operating in transmission mode for initial channel estimation.

Title: Active Learning-Driven Lightweight YOLOv9: Enhancing Efficiency in Smart Agriculture
Authors: Hung-Chih Tu, Bo-Syun Chen, Yun-Chien Cheng
Abstract: This study addresses the demand for real-time detection of tomatoes and tomato flowers by agricultural robots deployed on edge devices in greenhouse environments. Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images. Under limited annotation conditions, the framework achieves an overall detection accuracy of 67.8% mAP, validating its practicality and feasibility for intelligent agricultural applications.

Title: Synthetic Abundance Maps for Unsupervised Super-Resolution of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images
Authors: Xinxin Xu (LTCI, IDS, IP Paris, IMAGES), Yann Gousseau (LTCI, IMAGES), Christophe Kervazo (IDS, IMAGES), Saïd Ladjal (IMAGES, LTCI)
Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (HS-SISR) aims to enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images to fully exploit their spectral information. While considerable progress has been made in this field, most existing methods are supervised and require ground truth data for training-data that is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised training framework for HS-SISR, based on synthetic abundance data. The approach begins by unmixing the hyperspectral image into endmembers and abundances. A neural network is then trained to perform abundance super-resolution using synthetic abundances only. These synthetic abundance maps are generated from a dead leaves model whose characteristics are inherited from the low-resolution image to be super-resolved. This trained network is subsequently used to enhance the spatial resolution of the original image's abundances, and the final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by combining them with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate both the training value of the synthetic data and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Bayesian Matrix Completion Under Geometric Constraints
Authors: Rohit Varma Chiluvuri, Santosh Nannuru
Abstract: The completion of a Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) from sparse and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in signal processing, with applications in sensor network localization, acoustic room reconstruction, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. Traditional approaches, such as rank-constrained optimization and semidefinite programming, enforce geometric constraints but often struggle under sparse or noisy conditions. This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework that places structured priors directly on the latent point set generating the EDM, naturally embedding geometric constraints. By incorporating a hierarchical prior on latent point set, the model enables automatic regularization and robust noise handling. Posterior inference is performed using a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler to handle coupled latent point posterior. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy compared to deterministic baselines in sparse regimes.

Title: Streaming Speech Recognition with Decoder-Only Large Language Models and Latency Optimization
Authors: Genshun Wan, Wenhui Zhang, Jing-Xuan Zhang, Shifu Xiong, Jianqing Gao, Zhongfu Ye
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the potential of decoderonly large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, enabling streaming recognition within this framework remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel streaming ASR approach that integrates a read/write policy network with monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) to dynamically segment speech embeddings. These segments are interleaved with label sequences during training, enabling seamless integration with the LLM. During inference, the audio stream is buffered until the MoChA module triggers a read signal, at which point the buffered segment together with the previous token is fed into the LLM for the next token prediction. We also introduce a minimal-latency training objective to guide the policy network toward accurate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we adopt a joint training strategy in which a non-streaming LLM-ASR model and our streaming model share parameters. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 Mandarin benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recent streaming ASR baselines, achieving character error rates of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The latency optimization results in a 62.5% reduction in average token generation delay with negligible impact on recognition accuracy

Title: CALM: Joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling for Personalization of Multi-Speaker ASR
Authors: Muhammad Shakeel, Yosuke Fukumoto, Chikara Maeda, Chyi-Jiunn Lin, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: We present CALM, a joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling framework for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). In personalized AI scenarios, the joint availability of acoustic and linguistic cues naturally motivates the integration of target-speaker conditioning with contextual biasing in overlapping conversations. CALM implements this integration in an end-to-end framework through speaker embedding-driven target-speaker extraction and dynamic vocabulary-based contextual biasing. We evaluate CALM on simulated English (LibriSpeechMix) and Japanese (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese mixtures, CSJMix). On two-speaker mixtures, CALM reduces biased word error rate (B-WER) from 12.7 to 4.7 on LibriSpeech2Mix and biased character error rate (B-CER) from 16.6 to 8.4 on CSJMix2 (eval3), demonstrating the effectiveness of joint acoustic-linguistic modeling across languages. We additionally report results on the AMI corpus (IHM-mix condition) to validate performance on standardized speech mixtures.

Title: Degradation-Aware Frequency Regulation of a Heterogeneous Battery Fleet via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Tanay Raghunandan Srinivasa, Vivek Deulkar, Jia Bhargava, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Prashant Shenoy
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation. Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction. To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.

Title: EmoShift: Lightweight Activation Steering for Enhanced Emotion-Aware Speech Synthesis
Authors: Li Zhou, Hao Jiang, Junjie Li, Tianrui Wang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Achieving precise and controllable emotional expression is crucial for producing natural and context-appropriate speech in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.

Title: Development of Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) Approach for Underwater Images
Authors: Rajini Makam, Sharanya Patil, Dhatri Shankari T M, Suresh Sundaram, Narasimhan Sundararajan
Abstract: Underwater images suffer severe degradation due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, scattering, and illumination non-uniformity that vary across water types and depths. We propose an unsupervised Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) framework that integrates empirical correction with physics-guided modeling for robust underwater image enhancement. DIVER first applies either IlluminateNet for adaptive luminance enhancement or a Spectral Equalization Filter for spectral normalization. An Adaptive Optical Correction Module then refines hue and contrast using channel-adaptive filtering, while Hydro-OpticNet employs physics-constrained learning to compensate for backscatter and wavelength-dependent attenuation. The parameters of IlluminateNet and Hydro-OpticNet are optimized via unsupervised learning using a composite loss function. DIVER is evaluated on eight diverse datasets covering shallow, deep, and highly turbid environments, including both naturally low-light and artificially illuminated scenes, using reference and non-reference metrics. While state-of-the-art methods such as WaterNet, UDNet, and Phaseformer perform reasonably in shallow water, their performance degrades in deep, unevenly illuminated, or artificially lit conditions. In contrast, DIVER consistently achieves best or near-best performance across all datasets, demonstrating strong domain-invariant capability. DIVER yields at least a 9% improvement over SOTA methods in UCIQE. On the low-light SeaThru dataset, where color-palette references enable direct evaluation of color restoration, DIVER achieves at least a 4.9% reduction in GPMAE compared to existing methods. Beyond visual quality, DIVER also improves robotic perception by enhancing ORB-based keypoint repeatability and matching performance, confirming its robustness across diverse underwater environments.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Co-Design and Operation of Chiller and Thermal Energy Storage for Cost-Optimal HVAC Systems
Authors: Tanay Raghunandan Srinivasa, Vivek Deulkar, Aviruch Bhatia, Vishal Garg
Abstract: We study the joint operation and sizing of cooling infrastructure for commercial HVAC systems using reinforcement learning, with the objective of minimizing life-cycle cost over a 30-year horizon. The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.

Title: Intrinsic MIMO Particle Communication Channel with Random Advection
Authors: Fatih Merdan, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: In this work, receiver diversity in advection-dominated diffusion-advection channels is investigated. Strong directed flow fundamentally alters the communication-theoretic properties of molecular communication systems (MC). Specifically, advection preserves the temporal ordering and shape of transmitted pulses, enabling pulse-based and higher-order modulation schemes that are typically infeasible in purely diffusive environments. Focusing on a single transmitter and a single type of information molecule, it is demonstrated that spatially distributed receivers can observe distinct realizations of the same transmitted signal, giving rise to diversity gain. Several receiver combining strategies are evaluated and shown to improve detection performance compared to single-receiver operation, particularly in low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The results provide a structured framework for understanding receiver-side diversity in molecular communication, highlighting the role of advection as a key enabler for reliable pulse-based signaling. This perspective establishes a foundation for future studies on advanced modulation, joint equalization and detection, and multi-molecule MIMO extensions that can further enhance the performance and physical applicability of MC systems.

Title: Fluid Antenna Systems under Channel Uncertainty and Hardware Impairments: Trends, Challenges, and Future Research Directions
Authors: Saeid Pakravan, Mohsen Ahmadzadeh, Ming Zeng, Wessam Ajib, Ji Wang, Xingwang Li
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving spatially reconfigurable, compact, and energy-efficient wireless communications in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) networks. By dynamically repositioning a liquid-based radiating element within a confined physical structure, FAS can exploit spatial diversity without relying on multiple fixed antenna elements. This spatial mobility provides a new degree of freedom for mitigating channel fading and interference, while maintaining low hardware complexity and power consumption. However, the performance of FAS in realistic deployments is strongly affected by channel uncertainty, hardware nonidealities, and mechanical constraints, all of which can substantially deviate from idealized analytical assumptions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the operation and design of FAS under such practical considerations. Key aspects include the characterization of spatio-temporal channel uncertainty, analysis of hardware and mechanical impairments such as RF nonlinearity, port coupling, and fluid response delay, as well as the exploration of robust design and learning-based control strategies to enhance system reliability. Finally, open research directions are identified, aiming to guide future developments toward robust, adaptive, and cross-domain FAS design for next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Layer-Aware Early Fusion of Acoustic and Linguistic Embeddings for Cognitive Status Classification
Authors: Krystof Novotny, Laureano Moro-Velázquez, Jiri Mekyska
Abstract: Speech contains both acoustic and linguistic patterns that reflect cognitive decline, and therefore models describing only one domain cannot fully capture such complexity. This study investigates how early fusion (EF) of speech and its corresponding transcription text embeddings, with attention to encoder layer depth, can improve cognitive status classification. Using a DementiaBank-derived collection of recordings (1,629 speakers; cognitively normal controls$\unicode{x2013}$CN, Mild Cognitive Impairment$\unicode{x2013}$MCI, and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias$\unicode{x2013}$ADRD), we extracted frame-aligned embeddings from different internal layers of wav2vec 2.0 or Whisper combined with DistilBERT or RoBERTa. Unimodal, EF and late fusion (LF) models were trained with a transformer classifier, optimized, and then evaluated across 10 seeds. Performance consistently peaked in mid encoder layers ($\sim$8$\unicode{x2013}$10), with the single best F1 at Whisper + RoBERTa layer 9 and the best log loss at Whisper + DistilBERT layer 10. Acoustic-only models consistently outperformed text-only variants. EF boosts discrimination for genuinely acoustic embeddings, whereas LF improves probability calibration. Layer choice critically shapes clinical multimodal synergy.

Title: Scale Equivariance Regularization and Feature Lifting in High Dynamic Range Modulo Imaging
Authors: Brayan Monroy, Jorge Bacca
Abstract: Modulo imaging enables high dynamic range (HDR) acquisition by cyclically wrapping saturated intensities, but accurate reconstruction remains challenging due to ambiguities between natural image edges and artificial wrap discontinuities. This work proposes a learning-based HDR restoration framework that incorporates two key strategies: (i) a scale-equivariant regularization that enforces consistency under exposure variations, and (ii) a feature lifting input design combining the raw modulo image, wrapped finite differences, and a closed-form initialization. Together, these components enhance the network's ability to distinguish true structure from wrapping artifacts, yielding state-of-the-art performance across perceptual and linear HDR quality metrics.

Title: Learning-Based Signal Recovery in Nonlinear Systems with Spectrally Separated Interference
Authors: Jayadev Joy, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Upper Mid-Band (FR3, 7-24 GHz) receivers for 6G must operate over wide bandwidths in dense spectral environments, making them particularly vulnerable to strong adjacent-band interference and front-end nonlinearities. While conventional linear receivers can suppress spectrally separated interferers under ideal hardware assumptions, receiver saturation and finite-resolution quantization cause nonlinear spectral leakage that severely degrades performance in practical wideband radios. We study the recovery of a desired signal from nonlinear receiver observations corrupted by a high-power out-of-band interferer. The receiver front-end is modeled as a smooth, memoryless nonlinearity followed by additive noise and optional quantization. To mitigate these nonlinear and quantization-induced distortions, we propose a learned multi-layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (LMLVAMP) algorithm that incorporates spectral priors with neural network based denoising. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional methods, particularly in high-interference regimes representative of FR3 coexistence scenarios.

Title: Vision-Language Controlled Deep Unfolding for Joint Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation
Authors: Ping Chen, Zicheng Huang, Xiangming Wang, Yungeng Liu, Bingyu Liang, Haijin Zeng, Yongyong Chen
Abstract: We propose VL-DUN, a principled framework for joint All-in-One Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation (AiOMIRS) that bridges the gap between low-level signal recovery and high-level semantic understanding. While standard pipelines treat these tasks in isolation, our core insight is that they are fundamentally synergistic: restoration provides clean anatomical structures to improve segmentation, while semantic priors regularize the restoration process. VL-DUN resolves the sub-optimality of sequential processing through two primary innovations. (1) We formulate AiOMIRS as a unified optimization problem, deriving an interpretable joint unfolding mechanism where restoration and segmentation are mathematically coupled for mutual refinement. (2) We introduce a frequency-aware Mamba mechanism to capture long-range dependencies for global segmentation while preserving the high-frequency textures necessary for restoration. This allows for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity, effectively mitigating the spectral bias of standard architectures. As a pioneering work in the AiOMIRS task, VL-DUN establishes a new state-of-the-art across multi-modal benchmarks, improving PSNR by 0.92 dB and the Dice coefficient by 9.76\%. Our results demonstrate that joint collaborative learning offers a superior, more robust solution for complex clinical workflows compared to isolated task processing.

Title: Energy Management Strategies for Electric Aircraft Charging Leveraging Active Landside Vehicle-to-Grid
Authors: Finn Vehlhaber, Mauro Salazar
Abstract: The deployment of medium-range battery electric aircraft is a promising pathway to improve the environmental footprint of air mobility. Yet such a deployment would be accompanied by significant electric power requirements at airports due to aircraft charging. Given the growing prevalence of electric vehicles and their bi-directional charging capabilities--so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G)--we study energy buffer capabilities of parked electric vehicles to alleviate pressure on grid connections. To this end, we present energy management strategies for airports providing cost-optimal apron and landside V2G charge scheduling. Specifically, we first formulate the optimal energy management problem of joint aircraft charging and landside V2G coordination as a linear program, whereby we use partial differential equations to model the aggregated charging dynamics of the electric vehicle fleet. Second, we consider a shuttle flight network with a single hub of a large Dutch airline, real-world grid prices, and synthetic parking garage occupancy data to test our framework. Our results show that V2G at even a single airport can indeed reduce energy costs to charge the aircraft fleet: Compared to a baseline scenario without V2G, the proposed concept yields cost savings of up to 32%, depending on the schedule and amount of participating vehicles, and has other potential beneficial effects on the local power grid, e.g., the reduction of potential power peaks.

Title: Interpolation Techniques for Fast Channel Estimation in Ray Tracing
Authors: Ruibin Chen, Jayadev Joy, Yaqi Hu, Mingsheng Yin, Marco Mezzavilla, Sundeep Rangan
Abstract: Ray tracing is increasingly utilized in wireless system simulations to estimate channel paths. In large-scale simulations with complex environments, ray tracing at high resolution can be computationally demanding. To reduce the computation, this paper presents a novel method for conducting ray tracing at a coarse set of reference points and interpolating the channels at other locations. The key insight is to interpolate the images of reflected points. In addition to the computational savings, the method directly captures the spherical nature of each wavefront enabling fast and accurate computation of channels using line-of-sight MIMO and other wide aperture techniques. Through empirical validation and comparison with exhaustive ray tracing, we demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of our approach in achieving high-fidelity channel predictions with reduced computational resources.

Title: Compressed BC-LISTA via Low-Rank Convolutional Decomposition
Authors: Han Wang, Yhonatan Kvich, Eduardo Pérez, Florian Römer, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: We study Sparse Signal Recovery (SSR) methods for multichannel imaging with compressed {forward and backward} operators that preserve reconstruction accuracy. We propose a Compressed Block-Convolutional (C-BC) measurement model based on a low-rank Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) decomposition that is analytically initialized from a low-rank factorization of physics-derived forward/backward operators in time delay-based measurements. We use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to select a compact set of basis filters from the analytic model and compute linear mixing coefficients to approximate the full model. We consider the Learned Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA) network as a representative example for which the C-BC-LISTA extension is presented. In simulated multichannel ultrasound imaging across multiple Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), C-BC-LISTA requires substantially fewer parameters and smaller model size than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving reconstruction accuracy. In ablations over OMP, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based, and random initializations, OMP-initialized structured compression performs best, yielding the most efficient training and the best performance.

Title: Robust Control of Constrained Linear Systems using Online Convex Optimization and a Reference Governor
Authors: Marko Nonhoff, Mohammad Taher Al Torshan, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: This article develops a control method for linear time-invariant systems subject to time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions, that satisfies state and input constraints, and is robust to exogenous disturbances. To this end, we combine the online convex optimization framework with a reference governor and a constraint tightening approach. The proposed framework guarantees recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction. Its closed-loop performance is studied in terms of its dynamic regret, which is bounded linearly by the variation of the cost functions and the magnitude of the disturbances. The proposed method is illustrated by a numerical case study of a tracking control problem.

Title: Beyond Omnidirectional: Neural Ambisonics Encoding for Arbitrary Microphone Directivity Patterns using Cross-Attention
Authors: Mikko Heikkinen, Archontis Politis, Konstantinos Drossos, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: We present a deep neural network approach for encoding microphone array signals into Ambisonics that generalizes to arbitrary microphone array configurations with fixed microphone count but varying locations and frequency-dependent directional characteristics. Unlike previous methods that rely only on array geometry as metadata, our approach uses directional array transfer functions, enabling accurate characterization of real-world arrays. The proposed architecture employs separate encoders for audio and directional responses, combining them through cross-attention mechanisms to generate array-independent spatial audio representations. We evaluate the method on simulated data in two settings: a mobile phone with complex body scattering, and a free-field condition, both with varying numbers of sound sources in reverberant environments. Evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms both conventional digital signal processing-based methods and existing deep neural network solutions. Furthermore, using array transfer functions instead of geometry as metadata input improves accuracy on realistic arrays.

Title: Scale-Cascaded Diffusion Models for Super-Resolution in Medical Imaging
Authors: Darshan Thaker, Mahmoud Mostapha, Radu Miron, Shihan Qiu, Mariappan Nadar
Abstract: Diffusion models have been increasingly used as strong generative priors for solving inverse problems such as super-resolution in medical imaging. However, these approaches typically utilize a diffusion prior trained at a single scale, ignoring the hierarchical scale structure of image data. In this work, we propose to decompose images into Laplacian pyramid scales and train separate diffusion priors for each frequency band. We then develop an algorithm to perform super-resolution that utilizes these priors to progressively refine reconstructions across different scales. Evaluated on brain, knee, and prostate MRI data, our approach both improves perceptual quality over baselines and reduces inference time through smaller coarse-scale networks. Our framework unifies multiscale reconstruction and diffusion priors for medical image super-resolution.

Title: Solving Inverse Problems with Flow-based Models via Model Predictive Control
Authors: George Webber, Alexander Denker, Riccardo Barbano, Andrew J Reader
Abstract: Flow-based generative models provide strong unconditional priors for inverse problems, but guiding their dynamics for conditional generation remains challenging. Recent work casts training-free conditional generation in flow models as an optimal control problem; however, solving the resulting trajectory optimisation is computationally and memory intensive, requiring differentiation through the flow dynamics or adjoint solves. We propose MPC-Flow, a model predictive control framework that formulates inverse problem solving with flow-based generative models as a sequence of control sub-problems, enabling practical optimal control-based guidance at inference time. We provide theoretical guarantees linking MPC-Flow to the underlying optimal control objective and show how different algorithmic choices yield a spectrum of guidance algorithms, including regimes that avoid backpropagation through the generative model trajectory. We evaluate MPC-Flow on benchmark image restoration tasks, spanning linear and non-linear settings such as in-painting, deblurring, and super-resolution, and demonstrate strong performance and scalability to massive state-of-the-art architectures via training-free guidance of FLUX.2 (32B) in a quantised setting on consumer hardware.

Title: Attention Isn't All You Need for Emotion Recognition:Domain Features Outperform Transformers on the EAV Dataset
Authors: Anmol Guragain
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9\% to \textbf{65.56\%} (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved \textbf{67.62\%} (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached \textbf{75.30\%}, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5\%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved \textbf{72.68\%} (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.

Title: Proliferating series by Jean Barraqué: a study and classification in mathematical terms
Authors: Isabel Tardón, Pablo Martín-Santamaría
Abstract: Barraqué's proliferating series give an interesting turn on the concept of classic serialism by creating a new invariant when it comes to constructing the series: rather than the intervals between consecutive notes, what remains unaltered during the construction of the proliferations of the given base series is the permutation of the notes which happens between two consecutive series, that is to say, the transformation of the order of the notes in the series. This presents new possibilities for composers interested in the serial method, given the fact that the variety of intervals obtained by this method is far greater than that of classic serialism. In this manuscript, we will study some unexplored possibilities that the proliferating series offer from a mathematical point of view, which will allow composers to gain much more familiarity with them and potentially result in the creation of pieces that take serialism to the next level.

Title: Neural Signals Generate Clinical Notes in the Wild
Authors: Jathurshan Pradeepkumar, Zheng Chen, Jimeng Sun
Abstract: Generating clinical reports that summarize abnormal patterns, diagnostic findings, and clinical interpretations from long-term EEG recordings remains labor-intensive. We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\%$--$95\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$. In the zero-shot setting without patient history, CELM attains generation scores in the range of $0.43$--$0.52$, compared to baselines of $0.17$--$0.26$. CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to enable scalable multimodal learning. We release our model and benchmark construction pipeline at [URL].

Title: PersonaCite: VoC-Grounded Interviewable Agentic Synthetic AI Personas for Verifiable User and Design Research
Authors: Mario Truss
Abstract: LLM-based and agent-based synthetic personas are increasingly used in design and product decision-making, yet prior work shows that prompt-based personas often produce persuasive but unverifiable responses that obscure their evidentiary basis. We present PersonaCite, an agentic system that reframes AI personas as evidence-bounded research instruments through retrieval-augmented interaction. Unlike prior approaches that rely on prompt-based roleplaying, PersonaCite retrieves actual voice-of-customer artifacts during each conversation turn, constrains responses to retrieved evidence, explicitly abstains when evidence is missing, and provides response-level source attribution. Through semi-structured interviews and deployment study with 14 industry experts, we identify preliminary findings on perceived benefits, validity concerns, and design tensions, and propose Persona Provenance Cards as a documentation pattern for responsible AI persona use in human-centered design workflows.

Title: Forecasting in the presence of scale-free noise
Authors: Serhii Kryhin, Tatiana Mouzykantskii, Vivishek Sudhir
Abstract: The extraction of signals from noise is a common problem in all areas of science and engineering. A particularly useful version is that of forecasting: determining a causal filter that estimates a future value of a hidden process from past observations. Current techniques for deriving the filter require that the noise be well described by rational power spectra. However, scale-free noises, whose spectra scale as a non-integer power of frequency, are ubiquitous in practice. We establish a method, together with performance guarantees, that solves the forecasting problem in the presence of scale-free noise. Via the duality between estimation and control, our technique can be used to design control for distributed systems. These results will have wide-ranging applications in neuroscience, finance, fluid dynamics, and quantum measurements.

Title: Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer for Indoor Localization in Wi-Fi Driven Networks
Authors: Ayesh Abu Lehyeh, Anastassia Gharib, Safwan Wshah
Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical enabler for a wide range of location-based services in smart environments, including navigation, asset tracking, and safety-critical applications. Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.

Title: Capacity of Two-User Wireless Systems Aided by Movable Signals
Authors: Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Movable signals have emerged as a third approach to enable smart radio environments (SREs), complementing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and flexible antennas. This paper investigates their potential to enhance multi-user wireless systems. Focusing on two-user systems, we characterize the capacity regions of the multiple access channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC). Interestingly, movable signals can dynamically adjust the operating frequency to orthogonalize the user channels, thereby significantly expanding the capacity regions. We also study frequency optimization, constraining it in a limited frequency range, and show that movable signals provide up to 45% sum rate gain over fixed signals.

Title: An Effective Energy Mask-based Adversarial Evasion Attacks against Misclassification in Speaker Recognition Systems
Authors: Chanwoo Park, Chanwoo Kim
Abstract: Evasion attacks pose significant threats to AI systems, exploiting vulnerabilities in machine learning models to bypass detection mechanisms. The widespread use of voice data, including deepfakes, in promising future industries is currently hindered by insufficient legal frameworks. Adversarial attack methods have emerged as the most effective countermeasure against the indiscriminate use of such data. This research introduces masked energy perturbation (MEP), a novel approach using power spectrum for energy masking of original voice data. MEP applies masking to small energy regions in the frequency domain before generating adversarial perturbations, targeting areas less noticeable to the human auditory model. The study primarily employs advanced speaker recognition models, including ECAPA-TDNN and ResNet34, which have shown remarkable performance in speaker verification tasks. The proposed MEP method demonstrated strong performance in both audio quality and evasion effectiveness. The energy masking approach effectively minimizes the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) degradation, indicating that minimal perceptual distortion occurs to the human listener despite the adversarial perturbations. Specifically, in the PESQ evaluation, the relative performance of the MEP method was 26.68% when compared to the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and iterative FGSM.

Title: Rethinking Speech Representation Aggregation in Speech Enhancement: A Phonetic Mutual Information Perspective
Authors: Seungu Han, Sungho Lee, Kyogu Lee
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement (SE) models increasingly leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) representations for their rich semantic information. Typically, intermediate features are aggregated into a single representation via a lightweight adaptation module. However, most SSL models are not trained for noise robustness, which can lead to corrupted semantic representations. Moreover, the adaptation module is trained jointly with the SE model, potentially prioritizing acoustic details over semantic information, contradicting the original purpose. To address this issue, we first analyze the behavior of SSL models on noisy speech from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we measure the mutual information (MI) between the corrupted SSL representations and the corresponding phoneme labels, focusing on preservation of linguistic contents. Building upon this analysis, we introduce the linguistic aggregation layer, which is pre-trained to maximize MI with phoneme labels (with optional dynamic aggregation) and then frozen during SE training. Experiments show that this decoupled approach improves Word Error Rate (WER) over jointly optimized baselines, demonstrating the benefit of explicitly aligning the adaptation module with linguistic contents.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Early-Stage IR-Drop Estimation via CNN Surrogate Modeling
Authors: Ritesh Bhadana
Abstract: IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis. The implementation, dataset generation scripts, and the interactive inference application are publicly available at: this https URL. The live application can be accessed at: this https URL.

Title: A Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Behavior Recognition System via Edge-Cloud Collaboration
Authors: Huan Song, Shuyu Tian, Junyi Hao, Cheng Yuan, Zhenyu Jia, Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li
Abstract: As intelligent sensing expands into high-privacy environments such as restrooms and changing rooms, the field faces a critical privacy-security paradox. Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.

Title: Leveraging Convolutional Sparse Autoencoders for Robust Movement Classification from Low-Density sEMG
Authors: Blagoj Hristov, Zoran Hadzi-Velkov, Katerina Hadzi-Velkova Saneva, Gorjan Nadzinski, Vesna Ojleska Latkoska
Abstract: Reliable control of myoelectric prostheses is often hindered by high inter-subject variability and the clinical impracticality of high-density sensor arrays. This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.

Title: Iterative execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms with applications for signal denoising via sparsification
Authors: H. Robert Frost
Abstract: We describe a family of iterative algorithms that involve the repeated execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. One interesting member of this family is motivated by the discrete Fourier transform uncertainty principle and involves the application of a sparsification operation to both the real domain and frequency domain data with convergence obtained when real domain sparsity hits a stable pattern. This sparsification variant has practical utility for signal denoising, in particular the recovery of a periodic spike signal in the presence of Gaussian noise. General convergence properties and denoising performance relative to existing methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. An R package implementing this technique and related resources can be found at this https URL.

Title: Evidence for Phenotype-Driven Disparities in Freezing of Gait Detection and Approaches to Bias Mitigation
Authors: Timothy Odonga, Christine D. Esper, Stewart A. Factor, J. Lucas McKay, Hyeokhyen Kwon
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a common cause of injurious falls. Recent advances in wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) enable FOG detection, but bias and fairness in these models remain understudied. Bias refers to systematic errors leading to unequal outcomes, while fairness refers to consistent performance across subject groups. Biased models could systematically underserve patients with specific FOG phenotypes or demographics, potentially widening care disparities. We systematically evaluated bias and fairness of state-of-the-art HAR models for FOG detection across phenotypes and demographics using multi-site datasets. We assessed four mitigation approaches: conventional methods (threshold optimization and adversarial debiasing) and transfer learning approaches (multi-site transfer and fine-tuning large pretrained models). Fairness was quantified using demographic parity ratio (DPR) and equalized odds ratio (EOR). HAR models exhibited substantial bias (DPR & EOR < 0.8) across age, sex, disease duration, and critically, FOG phenotype. Phenotype-specific bias is particularly concerning as tremulous and akinetic FOG require different clinical management. Conventional bias mitigation methods failed: threshold optimization (DPR=-0.126, EOR=+0.063) and adversarial debiasing (DPR=-0.008, EOR=-0.001) showed minimal improvement. In contrast, transfer learning from multi-site datasets significantly improved fairness (DPR=+0.037, p<0.01; EOR=+0.045, p<0.01) and performance (F1-score=+0.020, p<0.05). Transfer learning across diverse datasets is essential for developing equitable HAR models that reliably detect FOG across all patient phenotypes, ensuring wearable-based monitoring benefits all individuals with PD.

Title: Robust Transceiver Design for RIS Enhanced Dual-Functional Radar-Communication with Movable Antenna
Authors: Ran Yang, Zheng Dong, Yue Xiu, Guangyi Liu, Wanting Lyu, Xiangxin Meng, Yan Li, Ning Wei
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this paper, we explore an MA-aided DFRC system that utilizes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance signal coverage for communications in dead zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance in practical DFRC environments, we propose a unified robust transceiver design framework aimed at maximizing the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a cluttered environment. Our approach jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, receive filtering, antenna placement, and RIS reflecting coefficients under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both sensing and communication channels. To deal with the channel uncertainty-constrained issue, we leverage the convex hull method to transform the primal problem into a more tractable form. We then introduce a two-layer block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating fractional programming (FP), successive convex approximation (SCA), S-Lemma, and penalty techniques to reformulate it into a series of semidefinite program (SDP) subproblems that can be efficiently solved. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the convergence and computational complexity for the proposed design framework. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, and show that the MA-based design framework can significantly enhance the radar SINR performance while achieving an effective balance between the radar and communication performance.

Title: Site-Specific Location Calibration and Validation of Ray-Tracing Simulator NYURay at Upper Mid-Band Frequencies
Authors: Mingjun Ying, Dipankar Shakya, Peijie Ma, Guanyue Qian, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins, enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by optimizing transmitter-receiver (T-R) locations to align simulated and measured power delay profiles, improving T-R location accuracy by 42.3% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Validation across 18 T-R locations over distances from 40 to 880 m between transmitter and receiver shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14 when comparing measured versus RT predicted power at all T-R locations. While RT underestimates measured delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

Title: A Review On Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Lyapunov and Barrier Functions
Authors: Dhruv Singh Kushwaha, Zoleikha Abdollahi Biron
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free RL.

Title: MAPSS: Manifold-based Assessment of Perceptual Source Separation
Authors: Amir Ivry, Samuele Cornell, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Objective assessment of source-separation systems still mismatches subjective human perception, especially when leakage and self-distortion interact. We introduce the Perceptual Separation (PS) and Perceptual Match (PM), the first pair of measures that functionally isolate these two factors. Our intrusive method begins with generating a bank of fundamental distortions for each reference waveform signal in the mixture. Distortions, references, and their respective system outputs from all sources are then independently encoded by a pre-trained self-supervised learning model. These representations are aggregated and projected onto a manifold via diffusion maps, which aligns Euclidean distances on the manifold with dissimilarities of the encoded waveforms. On this manifold, the PM measures the Mahalanobis distance from each output to its attributed cluster that consists of its reference and distortions embeddings, capturing self-distortion. The PS accounts for the Mahalanobis distance of the output to the attributed and to the closest non-attributed clusters, quantifying leakage. Both measures are differentiable and granular, operating at a resolution as low as 50 frames per second. We further derive, for both measures, deterministic error radius and non-asymptotic, high-probability confidence intervals (CIs). Experiments on English, Spanish, and music mixtures show that the PS and PM nearly always achieve the highest linear correlation coefficients with human mean-opinion scores than 14 competitors, reaching as high as 86.36% for speech and 87.21% for music. We observe, at worst, an error radius of 1.39% and a probabilistic 95% CI of 12.21% for these coefficients, which improves reliable and informed evaluation. Using mutual information, the measures complement each other most as their values decrease, suggesting they are jointly more informative as system performance degrades.

Title: Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration
Authors: Ziad Hatab, Michael Ernst Gadringer, Arash Arsanjani, Wolfgang Boesch
Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.

Title: Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?
Authors: Rostislav Makarov, Lea Schönherr, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.

Title: SynthCloner: Synthesizer-style Audio Transfer via Factorized Codec with ADSR Envelope Control
Authors: Jeng-Yue Liu, Ting-Chao Hsu, Yen-Tung Yeh, Li Su, Yi-Hsuan Yang
Abstract: Electronic synthesizer sounds are controlled by parameter settings that yield complex timbral characteristics and ADSR envelopes, making synthesizer-style audio transfer particularly challenging. Recent approaches to timbre transfer often rely on spectral objectives or implicit style matching, offering limited control over envelope shaping. Moreover, public synthesizer datasets rarely provide diverse coverage of timbres and ADSR envelopes. To address these gaps, we present SynthCloner, a factorized codec model that disentangles audio into three attributes: ADSR envelope, timbre, and content. This separation enables expressive audio transfer with independent control over these attributes. Additionally, we introduce SynthCAT, a new synthesizer dataset with a task-specific rendering pipeline covering 250 timbres, 120 ADSR envelopes, and 100 MIDI sequences. Experiments show that SynthCloner outperforms baselines on both objective and subjective metrics, while enabling independent attribute control. The code, model checkpoint, and audio examples are available at this https URL.

Title: Robust Radar Mounting Angle Estimation in Operational Driving Conditions
Authors: Simin Zhu, Satish Ravindran, Lihui Chen, Alexander Yarovoy, Francesco Fioranelli
Abstract: The robust estimation of the mounting angle for millimeter-wave automotive radars installed on moving vehicles is investigated. We propose a novel signal processing pipeline that combines radar and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to achieve accurate and reliable performance in realistic driving scenarios. Unlike previous studies, the method employs neural networks to process sparse and noisy radar measurements, reject detections from moving objects, and estimate radar motion. In addition, a measurement model is introduced to correct IMU bias and scale factor errors. Using vehicle kinematics, the radar mounting angle is then computed from the estimated radar motion and the vehicle's yaw rate. To benchmark performance, the proposed approach is comprehensively compared with two problem formulations and four estimation techniques reported in the literature. Validation is carried out on the challenging RadarScenes dataset, covering over 79 km of real-world driving. Results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, with reliable estimates obtained within approximately 25 seconds of driving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that automotive radar mounting angles can be accurately estimated in complex, real traffic conditions, without requiring controlled environments, dedicated targets, or specially designed driving routes.

Title: Environment-Aware MIMO Channel Estimation in Pilot-Constrained Upper Mid-Band Systems
Authors: Seyed Alireza Javid, Nuria González-Prelcic
Abstract: Accurate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation is critical for next-generation wireless systems, enabling enhanced communication and sensing performance. Traditional model-based channel estimation methods suffer, however, from performance degradation in complex environments with a limited number of pilots, while purely data-driven approaches lack physical interpretability, require extensive data collection, and are usually site-specific. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that combines model-based channel estimation with a deep network to exploit prior information about the propagation environment and achieve superior performance under pilot-constrained scenarios. The proposed approach employs an enhanced U-Net architecture with cross-attention mechanisms to fuse initial channel estimates with received signal strength (RSS) maps to provide refined channel estimates. Comprehensive evaluation using realistic ray-tracing data from urban environments demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving over 5 dB gain in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with particularly strong performance in pilot-limited scenarios and robustness across different frequencies and environments with only minimal fine-tuning. The proposed framework maintains practical computational complexity, making it viable for massive MIMO systems in upper mid-band frequencies.

Title: Hyperspectral Image Data Reduction for Endmember Extraction
Authors: Tomohiko Mizutani
Abstract: Endmember extraction from hyperspectral images aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials present in a scene. Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.

Title: Conformal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: A Cylindrical Geometry Perspective
Authors: Filippo Pepe, Ivan Iudice, Giuseppe Castaldi, Marco Di Renzo, Vincenzo Galdi
Abstract: Curved reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising frontier for next-generation wireless communication, enabling adaptive wavefront control on nonplanar platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles and urban infrastructure. This work presents a systematic investigation of cylindrical RISs, progressing from idealized surface-impedance synthesis to practical implementations based on simple one-bit meta-atoms. Exact analytical and geometrical-optics-based models are first developed to explore fundamental design limits, followed by a semi-analytical formulation tailored to discrete, reconfigurable architectures. This model enables efficient beam synthesis using both evolutionary optimization and low-complexity strategies, including the minimum power distortionless response method, and is validated through full-wave simulations. Results confirm that one-bit RISs can achieve directive scattering with manageable sidelobe levels and minimal hardware complexity. These findings establish the viability of cylindrical RISs and open the door to their integration into dual-use wireless platforms for real-world communication scenarios.

Title: WiFo-M$^2$: Empower Wireless Communications With Plug-and-Play Environment Sensing via Foundation Model
Authors: Haotian Zhang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: The emerging convergence of next-generation wireless networks and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is inspiring a new vision: embodied intelligent network entities utilize environmental sensing to refine their physical-layer (PHY) actions. Despite a growing body of preliminary work, prevailing small and task-specific AI models require extensive manual design of data pre-processing, network architecture, and fine-tuning, leaving them tightly coupled to particular PHY actions, system configurations, and deployment scenarios. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift with WiFo-M$^2$, a foundation model that enables environment sensing to be easily integrated into PHY actions, delivering universal performance gains. To extract generalizable out-of-band (OOB) channel-aware features from environment sensing, we introduce ContraSoM, a contrastive pre-training strategy. Once pre-trained, WiFo-M$^2$ infers future OOB channel-aware features from historical sensory data and strengthens feature robustness via modality-specific data augmentation. Experiments show that WiFo-M$^2$ improves the performance of diverse PHY actions and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios.

Title: Explainable histomorphology-based survival prediction of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype

Abstract: Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype (GBM-IDHwt) is the most common malignant brain tumor. Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival.

Title: PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images
Authors: Joel Hirst, Lorna Sibson, Adel Tayeb, Ben Poole, Megan Sampson, Wiera Bielajewa, Michael Atkinson, Alex Marsh, Rory Spencer, Rob Hamill, Cory Hamelin, Allan Harte, Lloyd Fletcher
Abstract: Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a widely used full-field measurement technique, but both open-source and commercial packages often have limitations such as operating-system restrictions, lack of support for deployment on computing clusters, and poor scalability to gigapixel-scale images common in Scanning Electron Microscopy DIC (SEM-DIC). Objective: Pyvale is an open-source software package designed for sensor simulation, uncertainty quantification, placement optimization, and calibration/validation. A key component of this is the development of a dedicated 2D DIC module intended for standalone use and integration within broader workflows. Methods: Pyvale provides a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled routines underneath. At its core is a multithreaded, reliability-guided DIC algorithm. Its open-source MIT license enables wide deployment, including on computing clusters and in automated pipelines. Results: Benchmarking with the publicly available 2D DIC challenge 2.0 dataset shows that Pyvale achieves metrological performance comparable to existing commercial and open-source DIC codes. It can correlate gigapixel-scale image pairs in under 5 minutes on high-specification desktop workstations, with memory peaking at approximately 50 GB. Conclusions: Pyvale's strong metrological foundation, coupled with its scalability for SEM-DIC, positions it as a platform for sustained, community-driven development. Its design and licensing provide a foundation for future improvements in open-source DIC and integration into experimental design and validation workflows.

Title: Movable Antenna Empowered Covert Dual-Functional Radar-Communication
Authors: Ran Yang, Ning Wei, Zheng Dong, Lin Zhang, Wanting Lyu, Yue Xiu, Ahmad Bazzi, Chadi Assi
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a secured dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system aided by movable antennas. To enhance the communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitter beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) and transmission covertness constraints. We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution. Then, we develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based algorithm to address the colluding detection problem. We further provide a comprehensive complexity analysis on the unified design framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a superior balance between communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.

Authors: Yuanchao Li
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays a pivotal role in understanding human communication, enabling emotionally intelligent systems, and serving as a fundamental component in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, deploying SER in real-world, spontaneous, and low-resource scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of emotional expression and the limitations of current speech and language technologies.

Title: Interpretable and backpropagation-free Green Learning for efficient multi-task echocardiographic segmentation and classification
Authors: Jyun-Ping Kao, Jiaxin Yang, C.-C. Jay Kuo, Jonghye Woo
Abstract: Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry "black boxes" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice.

Title: Precoding Design for Multi-User MIMO Joint Communications and Sensing
Authors: Charlotte Muth, Shrinivas Chimmalgi, Laurent Schmalen
Abstract: We investigate precoding for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) joint communications and sensing (JCAS) systems, taking into account the potential interference between sensing and communication channels. We derive indicators for the sensing and communication performance, i.e., the detection probability and the communication signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for general input signals. Our results show that the use of the communication signal for sensing can prevent a loss in communication performance if channel interference occurs, while the kurtosis of the transmit alphabet of the communication signal limits the sensing performance. We present simulation results of example setups.

Title: Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization
Authors: Xueping Zhang, Yaxiong Chen, Ruilin Yao, Yunfei Zi, Shengwu Xiong
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.

Title: Learning Hierarchical Sparse Transform Coding for 3DGS Compression
Authors: Hao Xu, Xiaolin Wu, Xi Zhang
Abstract: Current 3DGS compression methods largely forego the neural analysis-synthesis transform, which is a crucial component in learned signal compression systems. As a result, redundancy removal is left solely to the entropy coder, overburdening the entropy coding module and reducing rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To fix this critical omission, we propose a training-time transform coding (TTC) method that adds the analysis-synthesis transform and optimizes it jointly with the 3DGS representation and entropy model. Concretely, we adopt a hierarchical design: a channel-wise KLT for decorrelation and energy compaction, followed by a sparsity-aware neural transform that reconstructs the KLT residuals with minimal parameter and computational overhead. Experiments show that our method delivers strong R-D performance with fast decoding, offering a favorable BD-rate-decoding-time trade-off over SOTA 3DGS compressors.

Title: BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music
Authors: Chi Zuo, Martin B. Møller, Pablo Martínez-Nuevo, Huayang Huang, Yu Wu, Ye Zhu
Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Title: Impact of Phonetics on Speaker Identity in Adversarial Voice Attack
Authors: Daniyal Kabir Dar, Qiben Yan, Li Xiao, Arun Ross
Abstract: Adversarial perturbations in speech pose a serious threat to automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker verification by introducing subtle waveform modifications that remain imperceptible to humans but can significantly alter system outputs. While targeted attacks on end-to-end ASR models have been widely studied, the phonetic basis of these perturbations and their effect on speaker identity remain underexplored. In this work, we analyze adversarial audio at the phonetic level and show that perturbations exploit systematic confusions such as vowel centralization and consonant substitutions. These distortions not only mislead transcription but also degrade phonetic cues critical for speaker verification, leading to identity drift. Using DeepSpeech as our ASR target, we generate targeted adversarial examples and evaluate their impact on speaker embeddings across genuine and impostor samples. Results across 16 phonetically diverse target phrases demonstrate that adversarial audio induces both transcription errors and identity drift, highlighting the need for phonetic-aware defenses to ensure the robustness of ASR and speaker recognition systems.

Title: Thinking in cocktail party: Chain-of-Thought and reinforcement learning for target speaker automatic speech recognition
Authors: Yiru Zhang, Hang Su, Lichun Fan, Zhenbo Luo, Jian Luan
Abstract: Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (TS-ASR) aims to transcribe the speech of a specified target speaker from multi-speaker mixtures in cocktail party scenarios. Recent advancement of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) has already brought some new insights to TS-ASR. However, significant room for optimization remains for the TS-ASR task within the LALMs architecture. While Chain of Thoughts (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven effective in certain speech tasks, TS-ASR, which requires the model to deeply comprehend speech signals, differentiate various speakers, and handle overlapping utterances is particularly well-suited to a reasoning-guided approach. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that incorporates CoT and RL training into TS-ASR for performance improvement. A novel CoT dataset of TS-ASR is constructed, and the TS-ASR model is first trained on regular data and then fine-tuned on CoT data. Finally, the model is further trained with RL using selected data to enhance generalized reasoning capabilities. Experiment results show a significant improvement of TS-ASR performance with CoT and RL training, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CoT and RL training methods adapted for the TS-ASR task.

Title: CompSpoof: A Dataset and Joint Learning Framework for Component-Level Audio Anti-spoofing Countermeasures
Authors: Xueping Zhang, Yechen Wang, Linxi Li, Liwei Jin, Ming Li
Abstract: Component-level audio Spoofing (Comp-Spoof) targets a new form of audio manipulation where only specific components of a signal, such as speech or environmental sound, are forged or substituted while other components remain genuine. Existing anti-spoofing datasets and methods treat an utterance or a segment as entirely bona fide or entirely spoofed, and thus cannot accurately detect component-level spoofing. To address this, we construct a new dataset, CompSpoof, covering multiple combinations of bona fide and spoofed speech and environmental sound. We further propose a separation-enhanced joint learning framework that separates audio components apart and applies anti-spoofing models to each one. Joint learning is employed, preserving information relevant for detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline, highlighting the necessity of separate components and the importance of detecting spoofing for each component separately. Datasets and code are available at: this https URL.

Title: Towards a more realistic evaluation of machine learning models for bearing fault diagnosis
Authors: João Paulo Vieira, Victor Afonso Bauler, Rodrigo Kobashikawa Rosa, Danilo Silva
Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage. This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU), and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis applications.

Title: Model-Based Diffusion Sampling for Predictive Control in Offline Decision Making
Authors: Haldun Balim, Na Li, Yilun Du
Abstract: Offline decision-making via diffusion models often produces trajectories that are misaligned with system dynamics, limiting their reliability for control. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional diffusion framework that combines a diffusion planner with a dynamics diffusion model to generate task-aligned and dynamically plausible trajectories. MPDiffuser interleaves planner and dynamics updates during sampling, progressively correcting feasibility while preserving task intent. A lightweight ranking module then selects trajectories that best satisfy task objectives. The compositional design improves sample efficiency and adaptability by enabling the dynamics model to leverage diverse and previously unseen data independently of the planner. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over prior diffusion-based methods on unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) benchmarks, and validate practicality through deployment on a real quadrupedal robot.

Title: RefineBridge: Generative Bridge Models Improve Financial Forecasting by Foundation Models
Authors: Anthony Bolton, Wuyang Zhou, Zehua Chen, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo Mandic
Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.

Title: Robust and Secure Blockage-Aware Pinching Antenna-assisted Wireless Communication
Authors: Ruotong Zhao, Shaokang Hu, Deepak Mishra, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.

Title: LLM-ForcedAligner: A Non-Autoregressive and Accurate LLM-Based Forced Aligner for Multilingual and Long-Form Speech
Authors: Bingshen Mu, Xian Shi, Xiong Wang, Hexin Liu, Jin Xu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) predicts start and end timestamps for words or characters in speech, but existing methods are language-specific and prone to cumulative temporal shifts. The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods.

Title: Text-only adaptation in LLM-based ASR through text denoising

Abstract: Adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) to new domains using text-only data is a significant yet underexplored challenge. Standard fine-tuning of the LLM on target-domain text often disrupts the critical alignment between speech and text modalities learned by the projector, degrading performance. We introduce a novel text-only adaptation method that emulates the audio projection task by treating it as a text denoising task. Our approach thus trains the LLM to recover clean transcripts from noisy inputs. This process effectively adapts the model to a target domain while preserving cross-modal alignment. Our solution is lightweight, requiring no architectural changes or additional parameters. Extensive evaluation on two datasets demonstrates up to 22.1% relative improvement, outperforming recent state-of-the-art text-only adaptation methods.

Title: Qwen3-ASR Technical Report
Authors: Xian Shi, Xiong Wang, Zhifang Guo, Yongqi Wang, Pei Zhang, Xinyu Zhang, Zishan Guo, Hongkun Hao, Yu Xi, Baosong Yang, Jin Xu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin
Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

Title: SmartMeterFM: Unifying Smart Meter Data Generative Tasks Using Flow Matching Models
Authors: Nan Lin, Yanbo Wang, Jacco Heres, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.
