Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Interference Suppression in RIS-Aided Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Pujitha Mamillapalli, Shikhar Verma, Tiago Koketsu Rodrigues, Abhinav Kumar
Abstract: Future 6G networks envision ubiquitous connectivity through space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), where high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and satellites complement terrestrial systems to provide wide-area, low-latency coverage. However, the rapid growth of terrestrial devices intensifies spectrum sharing between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments, resulting in severe cross-tier interference. In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed DDPG framework optimizes the HAPS beamforming weights to form spatial nulls toward interference sources while maintaining robust links to the desired signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG framework consistently outperforms conventional ZF beamforming among different RIS configurations, achieving up to \(11.3\%\) throughput improvement for a \(4\times4\) RIS configuration, validating its adaptive capability to enhance spectral efficiency in dynamic HAPS-based SAGINs.

Title: Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for CSI-Based Activity Recognition in Bandwidth-Constrained Wi-Fi Sensing
Authors: Alison M. Fernandes, Hermes I. Del Monego, Bruno S. Chang, Anelise Munaretto, Hélder M. Fontes, Rui Campos
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid deep learning framework designed to enhance the robustness of CSI-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) within bandwidth-constrained Wi-Fi sensing environments. The core of our proposed methodology is a preliminary Doppler trace extraction stage, implemented to amplify salient motion-related signal features before classification. Subsequently, these enhanced inputs are processed by a hybrid neural architecture, which integrates Inception networks responsible for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks that capture temporal dependencies. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then utilized as the final classification layer to optimize decision boundaries. The framework's efficacy was systematically validated using a public dataset across 20, 40, and 80 MHz bandwidth configurations. The model yielded accuracies of 89.27% (20 MHz), 94.13% (40 MHz), and 95.30% (80 MHz), respectively. These results confirm a marked superiority over standalone deep learning baselines, especially in the most constrained low-bandwidth scenarios. This study underscores the utility of combining Doppler-based feature engineering with a hybrid learning architecture for reliable HAR in bandwidth-limited wireless sensing applications.

Title: A Pre-trained EEG-to-MEG Generative Framework for Enhancing BCI Decoding
Authors: Zhuo Li, Shuqiang Wang
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play important and complementary roles in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decoding. However, compared to the low cost and portability of EEG, MEG is more expensive and less portable, which severely limits the practical application of MEG in BCI systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI.

Title: Adaptive Temporal Dynamics for Personalized Emotion Recognition: A Liquid Neural Network Approach
Authors: Anindya Bhattacharjee, Nittya Ananda Biswas, K. A. Shahriar, Adib Rahman
Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological signals remains challenging due to their non-stationary, noisy, and subject-dependent characteristics. This work presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive application of liquid neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition. The proposed multimodal framework combines convolutional feature extraction, liquid neural networks with learnable time constants, and attention-guided fusion to model temporal EEG dynamics with complementary peripheral physiological and personality features. Dedicated subnetworks are used to process EEG features and auxiliary modalities, and a shared autoencoder-based fusion module is used to learn discriminative latent representations before classification. Subject-dependent experiments conducted on the PhyMER dataset across seven emotional classes achieve an accuracy of 95.45%, surpassing previously reported results. Furthermore, temporal attention analysis provides interpretable insights into emotion-specific temporal relevance, and t-SNE visualizations demonstrate enhanced class separability, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, statistical analysis of temporal dynamics confirms that the network self-organizes into distinct functional groups with specialized fast and slow neurons, proving it independently tunes learnable time constants and memory dominance to effectively capture complex emotion artifacts.

Title: Hierarchical JEPA Meets Predictive Remote Control in Beyond 5G Networks
Authors: Abanoub M. Girgis, Ibtissam Labriji, Mehdi Bennis
Abstract: In wireless networked control systems, ensuring timely and reliable state updates from distributed devices to remote controllers is essential for robust control performance. However, when multiple devices transmit high-dimensional states (e.g., images or video frames) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks, a critical trade-off emerges between communication efficiency and control performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) for scalable predictive control. Instead of transmitting states, device observations are encoded into low-dimensional embeddings that preserve essential dynamics. The proposed architecture employs a three-level hierarchical prediction, with high-level, medium-level, and low-level predictors operating across different temporal resolutions, to achieve long-term prediction stability, intermediate interpolation, and fine-grained refinement, respectively. Control actions are derived within the embedding space, removing the need for state reconstruction. Simulation results on inverted cart-pole systems demonstrate that H-JEPA enables up to 42.83 % more devices to be supported under limited wireless capacity without compromising control performance.

Title: OTFS-based Integrated Positioning and Communication Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs
Authors: Yueyi Yang, Zeping Sui, Zilong Liu, Leila Musavian
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-phase orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework under realistic low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In the uplink phase, the positioning signal is used to estimate channel parameters, which are subsequently used to determine the user's position. The spatial smoothing-multiple signal classification algorithm is introduced to estimate the angle-of-arrival, whereas an iterative interference cancellation scheme is conceived for the remaining parameters' estimation. The corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds of channel parameters and user position are also derived. During the downlink communication phase, the estimated parameters are exploited to improve beamforming at the base station. Simulation results evaluate the impact of ADC quantizer resolutions. Specifically, it is shown that enhanced downlink bit error rate performance can be achieved with improved uplink positioning, while the use of low-resolution ADCs induces noticeable performance degradation in the OTFS-IPAC system.

Title: Condition Errors Refinement in Autoregressive Image Generation with Diffusion Loss
Authors: Yucheng Zhou, Hao Li, Jianbing Shen
Abstract: Recent studies have explored autoregressive models for image generation, with promising results, and have combined diffusion models with autoregressive frameworks to optimize image generation via diffusion losses. In this study, we present a theoretical analysis of diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss, highlighting the latter's advantages. We present a theoretical comparison of conditional diffusion and autoregressive diffusion with diffusion loss, demonstrating that patch denoising optimization in autoregressive models effectively mitigates condition errors and leads to a stable condition distribution. Our analysis also reveals that autoregressive condition generation refines the condition, causing the condition error influence to decay exponentially. In addition, we introduce a novel condition refinement approach based on Optimal Transport (OT) theory to address ``condition inconsistency''. We theoretically demonstrate that formulating condition refinement as a Wasserstein Gradient Flow ensures convergence toward the ideal condition distribution, effectively mitigating condition inconsistency. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss methods.

Title: Guidestar-Free Adaptive Optics with Asymmetric Apertures
Authors: Weiyun Jiang, Haiyun Guo, Christopher A. Metzler, Ashok Veeraraghavan
Abstract: This work introduces the first closed-loop adaptive optics (AO) system capable of optically correcting aberrations in real-time without a guidestar or a wavefront sensor. Nearly 40 years ago, Cederquist et al. demonstrated that asymmetric apertures enable phase retrieval (PR) algorithms to perform fully computational wavefront sensing, albeit at a high computational cost. More recently, Chimitt et al. extended this approach with machine learning and demonstrated real-time wavefront sensing using only a single (guidestar-based) point-spread-function (PSF) measurement. Inspired by these works, we introduce a guidestar-free AO framework built around asymmetric apertures and machine learning. Our approach combines three key elements: (1) an asymmetric aperture placed in the optical path that enables PR-based wavefront sensing, (2) a pair of machine learning algorithms that estimate the PSF from natural scene measurements and reconstruct phase aberrations, and (3) a spatial light modulator that performs optical correction. We experimentally validate this framework on dense natural scenes imaged through unknown obscurants. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art guidestar-free wavefront shaping methods, using an order of magnitude fewer measurements and three orders of magnitude less computation.

Title: MTS-CSNet: Multiscale Tensor Factorization for Deep Compressive Sensing on RGB Images
Authors: Mehmet Yamac, Lei Xu, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj
Abstract: Deep learning based compressive sensing (CS) methods typically learn sampling operators using convolutional or block wise fully connected layers, which limit receptive fields and scale poorly for high dimensional data. We propose MTSCSNet, a CS framework based on Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) factorization, a structured operator for efficient multidimensional signal processing. MTS performs mode-wise linear transformations with multiscale summation, enabling large receptive fields and effective modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. In MTSCSNet, MTS is first used as a learnable CS operator that performs linear dimensionality reduction in tensor space, with its adjoint defining the initial back-projection, and is then applied in the reconstruction stage to directly refine this estimate. This results in a simple feed-forward architecture without iterative or proximal optimization, while remaining parameter and computation efficient. Experiments on standard CS benchmarks show that MTSCSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on RGB images, with notable PSNR gains and faster inference, even compared to recent diffusion-based CS methods, while using a significantly more compact feed-forward architecture.

Title: U-Net Based Image Enhancement for Short-time Muon Scattering Tomography
Authors: Haochen Wang, Pei Yu, Liangwen Chen, Weibo He, Yu Zhang, Yuhong Yu, Xueheng Zhang, Lei Yang, Zhiyu Sun
Abstract: Muon Scattering Tomography (MST) is a promising non-invasive inspection technique, yet the practical application of short-time MST is hindered by poor image quality due to limited muon flux. To address this limitation, we propose a U-Net-based framework trained on Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) images reconstructed with simulation MST data to enhance image quality. When applied to experimental MST data, the framework significantly improves image quality, increasing the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) from 0.7232 to 0.9699 and decreasing the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) from 0.3604 to 0.0270. These results demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance low-statistics MST images, thereby paving the way for the practical deployment of short-time MST.

Title: MRI Cross-Modal Synthesis: A Comparative Study of Generative Models for T1-to-T2 Reconstruction
Authors: Ali Alqutayfi, Sadam Al-Azani
Abstract: MRI cross-modal synthesis involves generating images from one acquisition protocol using another, offering considerable clinical value by reducing scan time while maintaining diagnostic information. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three state-of-the-art generative models for T1-to-T2 MRI reconstruction: Pix2Pix GAN, CycleGAN, and Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Using the BraTS 2020 dataset (11,439 training and 2,000 testing slices), we evaluate these models based on established metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Our experiments demonstrate that all models can successfully synthesize T2 images from T1 inputs, with CycleGAN achieving the highest PSNR (32.28 dB) and SSIM (0.9008), while Pix2Pix GAN provides the lowest MSE (0.005846). The VAE, though showing lower quantitative performance (MSE: 0.006949, PSNR: 24.95 dB, SSIM: 0.6573), offers advantages in latent space representation and sampling capabilities. This comparative study provides valuable insights for researchers and clinicians selecting appropriate generative models for MRI synthesis applications based on their specific requirements and data constraints.

Title: Exploring Polarimetric Properties Preservation during Reconstruction of PolSAR images using Complex-valued Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Quentin Gabot, Joana Frontera-Pons, Jérémy Fix, Chengfang Ren, Jean-Philippe Ovarlez
Abstract: The inherently complex-valued nature of Polarimetric SAR data necessitates using specialized algorithms capable of directly processing complex-valued representations. However, this aspect remains underexplored in the deep learning community, with many studies opting to convert complex signals into the real domain before applying conventional real-valued models. In this work, we leverage complex-valued neural networks and investigate the performance of complex-valued Convolutional AutoEncoders. We show that these networks can effectively compress and reconstruct fully polarimetric SAR data while preserving essential physical characteristics, as demonstrated through Pauli, Krogager, and Cameron coherent decompositions, as well as the non-coherent $H-\alpha$ decomposition. Finally, we highlight the advantages of complex-valued neural networks over their real-valued counterparts. These insights pave the way for developing robust, physics-informed, complex-valued generative models for SAR data processing.

Title: Behavior Score Prediction in Resting-State Functional MRI by Deep State Space Modeling
Authors: Javier Salazar Cavazos, Maximillian Egan, Krisanne Litinas, Benjamin Hampstead, Scott Peltier
Abstract: Early clinical assessment of Alzheimer's disease relies on behavior scores that measure a subject's language, memory, and cognitive skills. On the medical imaging side, functional magnetic resonance imaging has provided invaluable insights into the neural pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease. While prior studies have used resting-state functional MRI by extracting functional connectivity matrices, these approaches neglect the temporal dynamics inherent in functional data. In this work, we present a deep state space modeling framework that directly leverages the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series to learn a sparse collection of brain regions to predict behavior scores. Our model extracts temporal features that encapsulate nuanced patterns of intrinsic brain activity, thereby enhancing predictive performance compared to traditional connectivity methods. We identify specific brain regions that are most predictive of cognitive impairment through experiments on data provided by the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, providing new insights into the neural substrates of early Alzheimer's pathology. These findings have important implications for the possible development of risk monitoring and intervention strategies in Alzheimer's disease.

Title: DEMIX: Dual-Encoder Latent Masking Framework for Mixed Noise Reduction in Ultrasound Imaging
Authors: Soumee Guha, Scott T. Acton
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in noninvasive medical diagnostics due to its efficiency, portability, and avoidance of ionizing radiation. However, its utility is limited by the quality of the signal. Signal-dependent speckle noise, signal-independent sensor noise, and non-uniform spatial blurring caused by the transducer and modeled by the point spread function (PSF) degrade the image quality. These degradations challenge conventional image restoration methods, which assume simplified noise models, and highlight the need for specialized algorithms capable of effectively reducing the degradations while preserving fine structural details. We propose DEMIX, a novel dual-encoder denoising framework with a masked gated fusion mechanism, for denoising ultrasound images degraded by mixed noise and further degraded by PSF-induced distortions. DEMIX is inspired by diffusion models and is characterized by a forward process and a deterministic reverse process. DEMIX adaptively assesses the different noise components, disentangles them in the latent space, and suppresses these components while compensating for PSF degradations. Extensive experiments on two ultrasound datasets, along with a downstream segmentation task, demonstrate that DEMIX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior noise suppression and preserving structural details. The code will be made publicly available.

Title: Information Theory: An X-ray Microscopy Perspective
Authors: Charles Wood
Abstract: X-ray microscopy (XRM) is commonly used to obtain three-dimensional information on internal microstructure, but the imaging pipeline introduces noise, redundancy and information loss at multiple stages. This paper treats the XRM workflow as an information-processing system acting on a finite information budget. Using entropy, mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence, we quantify how acquisition, denoising, alignment, sparse-angle sampling, dose variation and reconstruction reshape the statistical structure of projection data and reconstructed volumes. Case studies based on the Walnut 1 dataset illustrate how these processes redistribute information and impose bottlenecks. We summarise the workflow using a unified information budget and show that mutual information provides a reconstruction-agnostic indicator of fidelity, supporting quantitative comparison and optimisation of XRM protocols, particularly under low-dose or time-constrained conditions

Title: ML-Enabled Deformable Matched Filters for Bandlimitation Compensation in Free-Space Optics
Authors: Paul Anthony Haigh
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural-network-assisted deformable matched filtering framework for carrier-less amplitude and phase (CAP) modulation operating under bandwidth-limited channel conditions. Instead of replacing the analytically derived CAP matched filter, the proposed receiver learns a residual deformation of the nominal matched filter based on a compact set of physically motivated signal features extracted from the received waveform. A total of 16 time-domain, frequency-domain, and memory-related features are used to provide a low-dimensional representation of bandwidth-induced pulse distortion. These features are mapped by a fully connected neural network to complex-valued matched filter coefficients, enabling adaptive pulse-shape compensation prior to symbol-rate sampling. The network is trained end-to-end using a differentiable loss function based on error vector magnitude (EVM). Experimental results obtained using a hardware-in-the-loop CAP transmission system demonstrate that the proposed deformable matched filter significantly outperforms conventional fixed matched filtering under severe bandwidth constraints, without requiring decision feedback or increasing receiver latency.

Title: Multi-Agentic AI for Fairness-Aware and Accelerated Multi-modal Large Model Inference in Real-world Mobile Edge Networks
Authors: Haiyuan Li, Hari Madhukumar, Shuangyi Yan, Yulei Wu, Dimitra Simeonidou
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has transformed applications in natural language processing and content creation, yet centralized inference remains hindered by high latency, limited customizability, and privacy concerns. Deploying large models (LMs) in mobile edge networks emerges as a promising solution. However, it also poses new challenges, including heterogeneous multi-modal LMs with diverse resource demands and inference speeds, varied prompt/output modalities that complicate orchestration, and resource-limited infrastructure ill-suited for concurrent LM execution. In response, we propose a Multi-Agentic AI framework for latency- and fairness-aware multi-modal LM inference in mobile edge networks. Our solution includes a long-term planning agent, a short-term prompt scheduling agent, and multiple on-node LM deployment agents, all powered by foundation language models. These agents cooperatively optimize prompt routing and LM deployment through natural language reasoning over runtime telemetry and historical experience. To evaluate its performance, we further develop a city-wide testbed that supports network monitoring, containerized LM deployment, intra-server resource management, and inter-server communications. Experiments demonstrate that our solution reduces average latency by over 80% and improves fairness (Normalized Jain index) to 0.90 compared to other baselines. Moreover, our solution adapts quickly without fine-tuning, offering a generalizable solution for optimizing GenAI services in edge environments.

Title: Extracting Root-Causal Brain Activity Driving Psychopathology from Resting State fMRI
Authors: Eric V. Strobl
Abstract: Neuroimaging studies of psychiatric disorders often correlate imaging patterns with diagnostic labels or composite symptom scores, yielding diffuse associations that obscure underlying mechanisms. We instead seek to identify root-causal maps -- localized BOLD disturbances that initiate pathological cascades -- and to link them selectively to symptom dimensions. We introduce a bilevel structural causal model that connects between-subject symptom structure to within-subject resting-state fMRI via independent latent sources with localized direct effects. Based on this model, we develop SOURCE (Symptom-Oriented Uncovering of Root-Causal Elements), a procedure that links interpretable symptom axes to a parsimonious set of localized drivers. Experiments show that SOURCE recovers localized maps consistent with root-causal BOLD drivers and increases interpretability and anatomical specificity relative to existing comparators.

Title: Wireless Context Engineering for Efficient Mobile Agentic AI and Edge General Intelligence
Authors: Changyuan Zhao, Jiacheng Wang, Yunting Xu, Geng Sun, Dusit Niyato, Zan Li, Abbas Jamalipour, Dong In Kim
Abstract: Future wireless networks demand increasingly powerful intelligence to support sensing, communication, and autonomous decision-making. While scaling laws suggest improving performance by enlarging model capacity, practical edge deployments are fundamentally constrained by latency, energy, and memory, making unlimited model scaling infeasible. This creates a critical need to maximize the utility of limited inference-time inputs by filtering redundant observations and focusing on high-impact data. In large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI), context engineering has emerged as a key paradigm to guide inference by selectively structuring and injecting task-relevant information. Inspired by this success, we extend context engineering to wireless systems, providing a systematic way to enhance edge AI performance without increasing model complexity. In dynamic environments, for example, beam prediction can benefit from augmenting instantaneous channel measurements with contextual cues such as user mobility trends or environment-aware propagation priors. We formally introduce wireless context engineering and propose a Wireless Context Communication Framework (WCCF) to adaptively orchestrate wireless context under inference-time constraints. This work provides researchers with a foundational perspective and practical design dimensions to manage the wireless context of wireless edge intelligence. An ISAC-enabled beam prediction case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm under constrained sensing budgets.

Title: Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Robust and Non-greedy Control Barrier Functions in Spacecraft Proximity Operations
Authors: Minduli C. Wijayatunga, Richard Linares, Roberto Armellin
Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft inspection and docking missions require controllers that can guarantee safety under thrust constraints and uncertainty. Input-constrained control barrier functions (ICCBFs) provide a framework for safety certification under bounded actuation; however, conventional ICCBF formulations can be overly conservative and exhibit limited robustness to uncertainty, leading to high fuel consumption and reduced mission feasibility. This paper proposes a framework in which the full hierarchy of class-$\mathcal{K}$ functions defining the ICCBF recursion is parameterized and learned, enabling localized shaping of the safe set and reduced conservatism. A control margin is computed efficiently using differential algebra to enable the learned continuous-time ICCBFs to be implemented on time-sampled dynamical systems typical of spacecraft proximity operations. A meta-reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train a policy that generates ICCBF parameters over a distribution of hidden physical parameters and uncertainties, using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Simulation results on cruise control, spacecraft inspection, and docking scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains safety while reducing fuel consumption and improving feasibility relative to fixed class-$\mathcal{K}$ ICCBFs, with the RNN showing a particularly strong advantage in the more complex inspection case.

Title: Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Zak-OTFS
Authors: Kecheng Zhang, Weijie Yuan, Yonghui Li
Abstract: The Zak-transform-based Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS), offers a robust framework for high-mobility communications by simplifying the input-output (I/O) relation to a twisted convolution. While this structure theoretically enables accurate channel estimation by sampling the response from one pilot symbol, practical implementation is constrained by the spreading of effective channel response induced by pulse shaping filters. To address this, we first derive the I/O relationship for discrete-time oversampled Zak-OTFS, which closely approximates the continuous-time system and facilitates analysis and numerical simulation. We show that every delay-Doppler domain symbol undergoes the same effective channel response under the discrete oversampled Zak-OTFS. We then analyze the impact of window ambiguity functions, and reveal that high sidelobes lead to wide channel spreading and degrade estimation accuracy. Building on this insight, we propose a novel pulse shaping filter design that synthesizes Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) within the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm (IOTA) framework. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed design achieves superior channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional root-raised-cosine and rectangular windowing schemes in the high-SNR regime.

Title: In-Context System Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics Using Large Language Models
Authors: Linyu Lin
Abstract: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a powerful method for discovering parsimonious governing equations from data, but it often requires expert tuning of candidate libraries. We propose an LLM-aided SINDy pipeline that iteratively refines candidate equations using a large language model (LLM) in the loop through in-context learning. The pipeline begins with a baseline SINDy model fit using an adaptive library and then enters a LLM-guided refinement cycle. At each iteration, the current best equations, error metrics, and domain-specific constraints are summarized in a prompt to the LLM, which suggests new equation structures. These candidate equations are parsed against a defined symbolic form and evaluated on training and test data. The pipeline uses simulation-based error as a primary metric, but also assesses structural similarity to ground truth, including matching functional forms, key terms, couplings, qualitative behavior. An iterative stopping criterion ends refinement early if test error falls below a threshold (NRMSE < 0.1) or if a maximum of 10 iterations is reached. Finally, the best model is selected, and we evaluate this LLM-aided SINDy on 63 dynamical system datasets (ODEBench) and march leuba model for boiling nuclear reactor. The results are compared against classical SINDy and show the LLM-loop consistently improves symbolic recovery with higher equation similarity to ground truth and lower test RMSE than baseline SINDy for cases with complex dynamics. This work demonstrates that an LLM can effectively guide SINDy's search through equation space, integrating data-driven error feedback with domain-inspired symbolic reasoning to discover governing equations that are not only accurate but also structurally interpretable.

Title: Message Passing based Parameter Estimation in Cooperative MIMO-OFDM ISAC Systems
Authors: Xiaohan Lv, Rang Liu, Yi Chen, Qian Liu, Ming Li
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks, multiple base stations (BSs) collaboratively sense a common target, leveraging diversity from multiple observation perspectives and joint signal processing to enhance sensing performance. This paper introduces a novel message-passing (MP)-based parameter estimation framework for collaborative MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, which jointly estimates the target's position and velocity. First, a signal propagation model is established based on geometric relationships, and a factor graph is constructed to represent the unknown parameters. The sum-product algorithm (SPA) is then applied to this factor graph to jointly estimate the multi-dimensional parameter vector. To reduce communication overhead and computational complexity, we employ a hierarchical message-passing scheme with Gaussian approximation. By adopting parameterized message distributions and layered processing, the proposed method significantly reduces both computational complexity and inter-BS communication overhead. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MP-based parameter estimation algorithm and highlight the benefits of multi-perspective observations and joint signal processing for cooperative sensing in MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.

Title: Wavelet-Domain Masked Image Modeling for Color-Consistent HDR Video Reconstruction
Authors: Yang Zhang, Zhangkai Ni, Wenhan Yang, Hanli Wang
Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) video reconstruction aims to recover fine brightness, color, and details from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) videos. However, existing methods often suffer from color inaccuracies and temporal inconsistencies. To address these challenges, we propose WMNet, a novel HDR video reconstruction network that leverages Wavelet domain Masked Image Modeling (W-MIM). WMNet adopts a two-phase training strategy: In Phase I, W-MIM performs self-reconstruction pre-training by selectively masking color and detail information in the wavelet domain, enabling the network to develop robust color restoration capabilities. A curriculum learning scheme further refines the reconstruction process. Phase II fine-tunes the model using the pre-trained weights to improve the final reconstruction quality. To improve temporal consistency, we introduce the Temporal Mixture of Experts (T-MoE) module and the Dynamic Memory Module (DMM). T-MoE adaptively fuses adjacent frames to reduce flickering artifacts, while DMM captures long-range dependencies, ensuring smooth motion and preservation of fine details. Additionally, since existing HDR video datasets lack scene-based segmentation, we reorganize HDRTV4K into HDRTV4K-Scene, establishing a new benchmark for HDR video reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving color fidelity, temporal coherence, and perceptual quality.

Title: Surveillance Facial Image Quality Assessment: A Multi-dimensional Dataset and Lightweight Model
Authors: Yanwei Jiang, Wei Sun, Yingjie Zhou, Xiangyang Zhu, Yuqin Cao, Jun Jia, Yunhao Li, Sijing Wu, Dandan Zhu, Xingkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: Surveillance facial images are often captured under unconstrained conditions, resulting in severe quality degradation due to factors such as low resolution, motion blur, occlusion, and poor lighting. Although recent face restoration techniques applied to surveillance cameras can significantly enhance visual quality, they often compromise fidelity (i.e., identity-preserving features), which directly conflicts with the primary objective of surveillance images -- reliable identity verification. Existing facial image quality assessment (FIQA) predominantly focus on either visual quality or recognition-oriented evaluation, thereby failing to jointly address visual quality and fidelity, which are critical for surveillance applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the first comprehensive study on surveillance facial image quality assessment (SFIQA), targeting the unique challenges inherent to surveillance scenarios. Specifically, we first construct SFIQA-Bench, a multi-dimensional quality assessment benchmark for surveillance facial images, which consists of 5,004 surveillance facial images captured by three widely deployed surveillance cameras in real-world scenarios. A subjective experiment is conducted to collect six dimensional quality ratings, including noise, sharpness, colorfulness, contrast, fidelity and overall quality, covering the key aspects of SFIQA. Furthermore, we propose SFIQA-Assessor, a lightweight multi-task FIQA model that jointly exploits complementary facial views through cross-view feature interaction, and employs learnable task tokens to guide the unified regression of multiple quality dimensions. The experiment results on the proposed dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art general image quality assessment (IQA) and FIQA methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world surveillance applications.

Title: Optimal Low-Dimensional Structures of ISAC Beamforming: Theory and Efficient Algorithms
Authors: Xiaotong Zhao, Mian Li, Ya-Feng Liu, Qingjiang Shi, Anthony Man-Cho So
Abstract: Transmit beamforming design is a fundamental problem in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Numerous methods have been proposed to jointly optimize key performance metrics such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and Cramér-Rao bound. However, the computational complexity of these methods often grows rapidly with the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). To tackle this challenge, we prove a fundamental structural property of the ISAC beamforming problem, i.e., there exists an optimal solution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure. This leads to an equivalent reformulation of the problem with dimension related to the number of users rather than the number of BS antennas, thereby enabling the development of low-complexity algorithms. When applying the interior-point method to the reformulated problem, we achieve up to six orders of magnitude in complexity reduction when the number of antennas exceeds the number of users by an order of magnitude. To further reduce the complexity, we develop a balanced augmented Lagrangian method to solve the reformulated problem. The proposed algorithm maintains optimality while achieving a computational complexity that scales quartically with the number of users. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed R-BAL method can achieve a speedup of more than 10000$\times$ over the conventional IPM in massive MIMO scenarios.

Title: Beyond $λ/2$: Can Arbitrary EMVS Arrays Achieve Unambiguous NLOS Localization?
Authors: Hua Chen, Zhenhao Yu, Tuo Wu, Wei Liu, Maged Elkashlan, Hyundong Shin, Matthew C. Valenti, Robert Schober
Abstract: Conventional radar array design mandates interelement spacing not exceeding half a wavelength ($\lambda/2$) to avoid spatial ambiguity, fundamentally limiting array aperture and angular resolution. This paper addresses the fundamental question: Can arbitrary electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays achieve unambiguous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization when element spacing exceeds $\lambda/2$? We provide an affirmative answer by exploiting the multi-component structure of EMVS measurements and developing a synergistic estimation and optimization framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bistatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. A third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) model is constructed from EMVS observations, enabling natural separation of spatial, polarimetric, and propagation effects via the trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. A novel phase-disambiguation procedure leverages rotational invariance across the six electromagnetic components of EMVSs to resolve $2\pi$ phase wrapping in arbitrary array geometries, allowing unambiguous joint estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) direction of departure (DOD), two-dimensional direction of arrival (DOA), and polarization parameters with automatic pairing. To support localization in NLOS environments and enhance estimation robustness, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is incorporated and its phase shifts are optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to maximize received signal power, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and further suppressing spatial ambiguities through iterative refinement.

Title: Fractional Filtering and Anomaly-Guided Diagnostics: The Local Damage Mode Extractor (LDME) for Early Gear Fault Detection
Authors: Yaakoub Berrouche
Abstract: Early and reliable detection of gear faults in complex drivetrain systems is critical for aviation safety and operational availability. We present the Local Damage Mode Extractor (LDME), a structured, physics-informed signal processing framework that combines dual-path denoising, multiscale decomposition, fractional-domain enhancement, and statistically principled anomaly scoring to produce interpretable condition indicators without supervision. LDME is organized in three layers: (i) dual-path denoising (DWT with adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing) to suppress broadband noise while preserving transient fault structure; (ii) multi-scale damage enhancement using a Teager-Kaiser pre-amplifier followed by a Hadamard-Caputo fractional operator that accentuates non-sinusoidal, low-frequency fault signatures; and (iii) decision fusion, where harmonics-aware Fourier indicators are combined and scored by an unsupervised anomaly detector. Evaluation using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, the HUMS 2023 planetary gearbox benchmark, and a controlled simulated dataset shows that LDME consistently distinguishes nominal, early-crack, and propagated-crack stages under various operating conditions. LDME identifies the primary detection event earlier (198 cycles) than HT-TSA (284 cycles) and advances maintenance recommendation time from 383 to 365 cycles. We discuss its relation to prior art, limitations, and future theoretical directions. All code and experimental configurations are documented for reproducibility.

Title: $\partial$CBDs: Differentiable Causal Block Diagrams
Authors: Thomas Beckers, Ján Drgoňa, Truong X. Nghiem
Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate physics, computation, and learning, demanding modeling frameworks that are simultaneously composable, learnable, and verifiable. Yet existing approaches treat these goals in isolation: causal block diagrams (CBDs) support modular system interconnections but lack differentiability for learning; differentiable programming (DP) enables end-to-end gradient-based optimization but provides limited correctness guarantees; while contract-based verification frameworks remain largely disconnected from data-driven model refinement. To address these limitations, we introduce differentiable causal block diagrams ($\partial$CBDs), a unifying formalism that integrates these three perspectives. Our approach (i) retains the compositional structure and execution semantics of CBDs, (ii) incorporates assume--guarantee (A--G) contracts for modular correctness reasoning, and (iii) introduces residual-based contracts as differentiable, trajectory-level certificates compatible with automatic differentiation (AD), enabling gradient-based optimization and learning. Together, these elements enable a scalable, verifiable, and trainable modeling pipeline that preserves causality and modularity while supporting data-, physics-, and constraint-informed optimization for CPS.

Title: A Scalable Cloud-Edge Collaborative CKM Construction Framework Enabled by a Foundation Prior Model
Authors: Sixu Xiao, Yong Zeng, Haotian Rong, Yanqun Tang
Abstract: Channel knowledge maps (CKMs) provide a site-specific, location-indexed knowledge base that supports environment-aware communications and sensing in 6G networks. In practical deployments, CKM observations are often noisy and irregular due to coverage-induced sparsity and hardware-induced linear/nonlinear degradations. Conventional end-to-end algorithms couple CKM prior information with task- and device-specific observations, and require labeled data and separate training for each construction configuration, which is expensive and therefore incompatible with scalable edge deployments. Motivated by the trends toward cloud-edge collaboration and the Artificial Intelligence - Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) paradigm, we develop a cloud-edge collaborative framework for scalable CKM construction, which enables knowledge sharing across tasks, devices, and regions by explicitly decoupling a generalizable CKM prior from the information provided by local observations. A foundation model is trained once in the cloud using unlabeled data to learn a generalizable CKM prior. During inference, edge nodes combine the shared prior with local observations. Experiments on the CKMImageNet dataset show that the proposed method achieves competitive construction accuracy while substantially reducing training cost and data requirements, mitigating negative transfer, and offering clear advantages in generalization and deployment scalability.

Title: A Tutorial on 3GPP Rel-19 Channel Modeling for 6G FR3 (7-24 GHz): From Standard Specification to Simulation Implementation
Authors: Pan Tang, Huixin Xu, Jianhua Zhang, Ximan Liu, Enrui Liu, Haiyang Miao, Xiaodong Sun, Wei Jiang, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: The upper-mid band (7-24 GHz), designated as Frequency Range 3 (FR3), has emerged as a definitive ``golden band" for 6G networks, strategically balancing the wide coverage of sub-6 GHz with the high capacity of mmWave. To compensate for the severe path loss inherent to this band, the deployment of Extremely Large Aperture Arrays (ELAA) is indispensable. However, the legacy 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model faces critical validity challenges when applied to 6G FR3, stemming from both the distinct propagation characteristics of this frequency band and the fundamental physical paradigm shift induced by ELAA. In response, 3GPP Release 19 (Rel-19) has validated the model through extensive new measurements and introduced significant enhancements. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to the Rel-19 channel model for 6G FR3, bridging the gap between standardization specifications and practical simulation implementation. First, we provide a high-level overview of the fundamental principles of the 3GPP channel modeling framework. Second, we detail the specific enhancements and modifications introduced in Rel-19, including the rationale behind the new Suburban Macro (SMa) scenario, the mathematical modeling of ELAA-driven features such as near-field and spatial non-stationarity, and the recalibration of large-scale parameters. Overall, this tutorial serves as an essential guide for researchers and engineers to master the latest 3GPP channel modeling methodology, laying a solid foundation for the accurate design and performance evaluation of future 6G FR3 networks.

Title: Quantifying resilience for distribution system customers with SALEDI
Authors: Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson
Abstract: The impact of routine smaller outages on distribution system customers in terms of customer minutes interrupted can be tracked using conventional reliability indices. However, the customer minutes interrupted in large blackout events are extremely variable, and this makes it difficult to quantify the customer impact of these extreme events with resilience metrics. We solve this problem with the System Average Large Event Duration Index SALEDI that logarithmically transforms the customer minutes interrupted. We explain how this new resilience metric works, compare it with alternatives, quantify its statistical accuracy, and illustrate its practical use with standard outage data from five utilities.

Title: MI-ISAC: Magneto-Inductive Integrated Sensing and Communication in the Reactive Near-Field for RF-Denied Environments
Authors: Haofan Dong, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Radio-frequency integrated sensing and communication (RF-ISAC) is ineffective inunderground, underwater, and in-body environments where conductive media attenuate electromagnetic waves by tens of dB per meter. This article presents magneto-inductive ISAC (MI-ISAC), a paradigm that exploits the reactive near-field quasi-static coupling inherent to MI links, enabling a fundamentally different approach to ISAC in these RF-denied environments. Five foundational results are established: (i)~tri-axial coils are necessary and sufficient for identifiable joint range-and-angle estimation; (ii)~coupling strength changes sharply with range, enabling theoretical sub-millimeter accuracy at typical MI distances despite kHz-level bandwidth; (iii)~time-of-flight is ineffective under such narrow bandwidth, but the coupling gradient provides approximately six orders of magnitude finer resolution; (iv)~MI-ISAC can provide 4--10+\,dB sensing gain over time-division baselines; and (v)~the MI-MIMO channel is geometry-invariant and well-conditioned across all orientations. Applications and a research roadmap are discussed.

Title: SoulX-Singer: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis
Authors: Jiale Qian, Hao Meng, Tian Zheng, Pengcheng Zhu, Haopeng Lin, Yuhang Dai, Hanke Xie, Wenxiao Cao, Ruixuan Shang, Jun Wu, Hongmei Liu, Hanlin Wen, Jian Zhao, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Shunshun Yin, Ming Tao, Jianguo Wei, Lei Xie, Xinsheng Wang
Abstract: While recent years have witnessed rapid progress in speech synthesis, open-source singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems still face significant barriers to industrial deployment, particularly in terms of robustness and zero-shot generalization. In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.

Title: Urban Congestion Patterns under High Electric Vehicle Penetration: A Case Study of 10 U.S. Cities
Authors: Xiaohan Xu, Wei Ma, Zhiheng Shi, Xiaotong Xu, Bin He, Kairui Feng
Abstract: With the global energy transition and the rapid penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), the widening travel cost gap between EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) increasingly affects commuters' route choices and may reshape urban congestion patterns. Existing research remains in its preliminary exploratory phase. On the one hand, multi-class models do not account for fixed user class scenarios, which may not align with actual commuters; on the other hand, there is a lack of systematic quantitative analysis based on real-world complex road networks across multiple cities. As a result, the congestion effects induced by heterogeneous GV-EV cost structures may be mischaracterized or substantially underestimated. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-user equilibrium (MUE) assignment model for mixed GV-EV traffic, constructs a dual algorithm with convergence guarantees, and designs multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for congestion patterns. Using 10 representative U.S. cities as a case study, this research explores the evolution trends of traffic congestion under different EV penetration scenarios based on real city-level road networks and block-level commuter origin-destination (OD) demand. The results show that full EV penetration reduces average system travel time by 2.27%--10.78% across the 10 cities, with New Orleans achieving the largest reduction (10.78%) and San Francisco the smallest (2.27%), but the effectiveness of alleviating congestion exhibits urban heterogeneity. Moreover, for cities with sufficient network redundancy, benefits are primarily concentrated during the low to medium EV penetration stage (0-0.5), though cities with topological constraints (e.g., San Francisco) show more limited improvements throughout all penetration levels. This paper can provide a foundation for formulating differentiated urban planning and congestion management policies.

Title: DINO-Mix: Distilling Foundational Knowledge with Cross-Domain CutMix for Semi-supervised Class-imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Guolei Sun
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for medical image segmentation, mitigating the immense cost of dense annotations. However, prevailing SSL frameworks are fundamentally "inward-looking", recycling information and biases solely from within the target dataset. This design triggers a vicious cycle of confirmation bias under class imbalance, leading to the catastrophic failure to recognize minority classes. To dismantle this systemic issue, we propose a paradigm shift to a multi-level "outward-looking" framework. Our primary innovation is Foundational Knowledge Distillation (FKD), which looks outward beyond the confines of medical imaging by introducing a pre-trained visual foundation model, DINOv3, as an unbiased external semantic teacher. Instead of trusting the student's biased high confidence, our method distills knowledge from DINOv3's robust understanding of high semantic uniqueness, providing a stable, cross-domain supervisory signal that anchors the learning of minority classes. To complement this core strategy, we further look outward within the data by proposing Progressive Imbalance-aware CutMix (PIC), which creates a dynamic curriculum that adaptively forces the model to focus on minority classes in both labeled and unlabeled subsets. This layered strategy forms our framework, DINO-Mix, which breaks the vicious cycle of bias and achieves remarkable performance on challenging semi-supervised class-imbalanced medical image segmentation benchmarks Synapse and AMOS.

Title: Convergence Analysis of Continuous-Time Distributed Stochastic Gradient Algorithms
Authors: Jianhua Sun, Kaihong Lu, Xin Yu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework to study distributed optimization problems with stochastic gradients by employing a multi-agent system with continuous-time dynamics. Here the goal of the agents is to cooperatively minimize the sum of convex objective functions. When making decisions, each agent only has access to a stochastic gradient of its own objective function rather than the real gradient, and can exchange local state information with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. Particularly, the stochasticity is depicted by the Brownian motion. To handle this problem, we propose a continuous-time distributed stochastic gradient algorithm based on the consensus algorithm and the gradient descent strategy. Under mild assumptions on the connectivity of the graph and objective functions, using convex analysis theory, the Lyapunov theory and Ito formula, we prove that the states of the agents asymptotically reach a common minimizer in expectation. Finally, a simulation example is worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Title: Optimized Deployment of HAPS Systems for GNSS Localization Enhancement in Urban Environments
Authors: Hongzhao Zheng, Mohamed Atia, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: While high altitude platform stations (HAPS) have been primarily explored as network infrastructure for communication services, their advantageous characteristics also make them promising candidates for augmenting GNSS localization. This paper proposes a metaheuristic framework to jointly optimize the number and placement of HAPS for GNSS enhancement in dense urban environments, considering practical constraints such as elevation masks, altitude limits, and ray-traced visibility from 3D city models. The problem is highly nonconvex due to the discrete HAPS count and the environment-dependent 3D Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To address this, we develop a tailored version of the adaptive special-crowding distance non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ASDNSGA-II). Simulations show the method successfully identifies the minimum number of HAPS needed to satisfy a CRLB threshold and selects the configuration with the lowest CRLB within that minimum, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future HAPS-aided positioning systems.

Title: Joint Simplicial Complex Learning via Binary Linear Programming
Authors: Varun Sarathchandran, Geert Leus
Abstract: Learning the topology of higher-order networks from data is a fundamental challenge in many signal processing and machine learning applications. Simplicial complexes provide a principled framework for modeling multi-way interactions, yet learning their structure is challenging due to the strong coupling across different simplicial levels imposed by the inclusion property. In this work, we propose a joint framework for simplicial complex learning that enforces the inclusion property through a linear constraint, enabling the formulation of the problem as a binary linear program. The objective function consists of a combination of smoothness measures across all considered simplicial levels, allowing for the incorporation of arbitrary smoothness criteria. This formulation enables the simultaneous estimation of edges and higher-order simplices within a single optimization problem. Experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed joint approach outperforms hierarchical and greedy baselines, while more faithfully enforcing higher-order structural priors.

Title: Healthcare Facility Assignment Using Real-Time Length-of-Stay Predictions: Queuing-Theoretic and Simulation-driven Machine Learning Approaches
Authors: Najiya Fatma, Varun Ramamohan
Abstract: Longer stays at healthcare facilities, driven by uncertain patient load, inefficient patient flow, and lack of real-time information about medical care, pose significant challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Providing patients with estimates of their expected real-time length of stay (RT-LOS), generated as a function of the operational state of the healthcare facility at their anticipated time of arrival (as opposed to estimates of average LOS), can help them make informed decisions regarding which facility to visit within a network. In this study, we develop a healthcare facility assignment (HFA) algorithm that assigns healthcare facilities to patients using RT-LOS predictions at facilities within the network of interest. We describe the generation of RT-LOS predictions via two methodologies: (a) an analytical queuing-theoretic approach, and (b) a hybrid simulation-driven machine learning approach. Because RT-LOS predictors are highly specific to the queuing system in question, we illustrate the development of RT-LOS predictors using both approaches by considering the outpatient experience at primary health centers. Via computational experiments, we compare outcomes from the implementation of the RT-HFA algorithm with both RT-LOS predictors to the case where patients visit the facility of their choice. Computational experiments also indicated that the RT-HFA algorithm substantially reduced patient wait times and LOS at congested facilities and led to more equitable utilization of medical resources at facilities across the network. Finally, we show numerically that the effectiveness of the RT-HFA algorithm in improving outcomes is contingent on the level of compliance with the assignment decision.

Title: Accuracy-Delay Trade-Off in LLM Offloading via Token-Level Uncertainty
Authors: Yumin Kim, Hyeonsu Lyu, Minjae Lee, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for intelligent mobile services but are computationally intensive for resource-constrained devices. Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows such devices to offload inference tasks to edge servers (ESs), yet introduces latency due to communication and serverside queuing, especially in multi-user environments. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware offloading framework that dynamically decides whether to perform inference locally or offload it to the ES, based on token-level uncertainty and resource constraints. We define a margin-based token-level uncertainty metric and demonstrate its correlation with model accuracy. Leveraging this metric, we design a greedy offloading algorithm (GOA) that minimizes delay while maintaining accuracy by prioritizing offloading for highuncertainty queries. Our experiments show that GOA consistently achieves a favorable trade-off, outperforming baseline strategies in both accuracy and latency across varying user densities, and operates with practical computation time. These results establish GOA as a scalable and effective solution for LLM inference in MEC environments.

Title: End-to-End Secure Connection Probability in MultiLayer Networks with Heterogeneous Rician Fading
Authors: Hyeonsu Lyu, Yumin Kim, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: Ensuring physical-layer security in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is challenging due to their global coverage and multi-hop relaying across heterogeneous network layers, where the locations and channels of potential eavesdroppers are typically unknown. In this work, we derive a tractable closedform expression of the end-to-end secure connection probability (SCP) of multi-hop relay routes under heterogeneous Rician fading. The resulting formula shares the same functional form as prior Rayleigh-based approximations but for the coefficients, thereby providing analytical support for the effectiveness of heuristic posterior coefficient calibration adopted in prior work. Numerical experiments under various conditions show that the proposed scheme estimates the SCP with an 1%p error in most cases; and doubles the accuracy compared with the conventional scheme even in the worst case. As a case study, we apply the proposed framework to real-world space-air-groundsea integrated network dataset, showing that the derived SCP accurately captures observed security trends in practical settings.

Title: Detect, Attend and Extract: Keyword Guided Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Haoyu Li, Yu Xi, Yidi Jiang, Shuai Wang, Kate Knill, Mark Gales, Haizhou Li, Kai Yu
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to extract the speech of a target speaker from mixtures containing multiple competing speakers. Conventional TSE systems predominantly rely on speaker cues, such as pre-enrolled speech, to identify and isolate the target speaker. However, in many practical scenarios, clean enrollment utterances are unavailable, limiting the applicability of existing approaches. In this work, we propose DAE-TSE, a keyword-guided TSE framework that specifies the target speaker through distinct keywords they utter. By leveraging keywords (i.e., partial transcriptions) as cues, our approach provides a flexible and practical alternative to enrollment-based TSE. DAE-TSE follows the Detect-Attend-Extract (DAE) paradigm: it first detects the presence of the given keywords, then attends to the corresponding speaker based on the keyword content, and finally extracts the target speech. Experimental results demonstrate that DAE-TSE outperforms standard TSE systems that rely on clean enrollment speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize partial transcription as a cue for specifying the target speaker in TSE, offering a flexible and practical solution for real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are now publicly available.

Title: Trustworthiness Layer for Foundation Models in Power Systems: Application for N-k Contingency Assessment
Authors: Antonio Alcántara, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: This work introduces for the first time, to our knowledge, a trustworthiness layer for foundation models in power systems. Using stratified conformal prediction, we devise adaptive, statistically valid confidence bounds for each output of a foundation model. For regression, this allows users to obtain an uncertainty estimate for each output; for screening, it supports conservative decisions that minimize false negatives. We demonstrate our method by enhancing GridFM, the first open-source Foundation Model for power systems, with statistically valid prediction intervals instead of heuristic error margins. We apply it for N-k contingency assessment, a combinatorial NP-Hard problem. We show that trustworthy GridFM can offer richer and more accurate information than DC Power Flow, having 2x-3x higher precision, while running up to 18x faster than AC Power Flow for systems up to 118 buses. Moving a step further, we also examine the ability of trustworthy GridFM to generalize to unseen high-order contingencies: through a rigorous analysis, we assess how a model trained on N-1 or N-2 outages extrapolates to unseen contingencies up to N-5.

Title: Adjustment of Cluster-Then-Predict Framework for Multiport Scatterer Load Prediction
Authors: Hanjun Park, Aleksandr D. Kuznetsov, Ville Viikari
Abstract: Predicting interdependent load values in multiport scatterers is challenging due to high dimensionality and complex dependence between impedance and scattering ability, yet this prediction remains crucial for the design of communication and measurement systems. In this paper, we propose a two-stage cluster-then-predict framework for multiple load values prediction task in multiport scatterers. The proposed cluster-then-predict approach effectively captures the underlying functional relation between S-parameters and corresponding load impedances, achieving up to a 46% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the baseline when applied to gradient boosting (GB). This improvement is consistent across various clustering and regression methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Real-world Unified Index (RUI), a metric for quantitative analysis of trade-offs among multiple metrics with conflicting objectives and different scales, suitable for performance assessment in realistic scenarios. Based on RUI, the combination of K-means clustering and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is identified as the optimal setup for the analyzed multiport scatterer.

Title: Robust and Gain-Scheduling ${\cal H}_2$ Control Techniques for LFT Uncertain and Parameter-Dependent Systems
Authors: Fen Wu
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust ${\cal H}_2$ synthesis problem for linear fractional transformation (LFT) systems subject to structured uncertainty (parameter) and white-noise disturbances. By introducing an intermediate matrix variable, we derive convex synthesis conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that enable both robust and gain-scheduled controller design for parameter-dependent systems. The proposed framework preserves the classical white-noise and impulse-response interpretation of the ${\cal H}_2$ criterion while providing certified robustness guarantees, thereby extending optimal ${\cal H}_2$ control beyond the linear time-invariant setting. Numerical and application examples demonstrate that the resulting robust ${\cal H}_2$ controllers achieve significantly reduced conservatism and improved disturbance rejection compared with conventional robust ${\cal H}_\infty$-based designs.

Title: AFDM: Evolving OFDM Towards 6G+
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Vincent Savaux, Zeping Sui, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Zilong Liu
Abstract: As the standardization of sixth generation (6G) wireless systems accelerates, there is a growing consensus in favor of evolutionary waveforms that offer new features while maximizing compatibility with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which underpins the 4G and 5G systems. This article presents affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) as a premier candidate for 6G, offering intrinsic robustness for both high-mobility communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in doubly dispersive channels, while maintaining a high degree of synergy with the legacy OFDM. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+).

Title: An Experimental Study on Fine-Grained Bistatic Sensing of UAV Trajectory via Cellular Downlink Signals
Authors: Chenqing Ji, Jiahong Liu, Qionghui Liu, Yifei Sun, Chao Yu, Rui Wang
Abstract: In this letter, a dual-bistatic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking system utilizing downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals is proposed and demonstrated. Particularly, two LTE base stations (BSs) are exploited as illumination sources. Two passive sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic Doppler frequencies of the target UAV at different directions according to downlink signals transmitted from their corresponding BSs, such that the velocities of the UAV versus time can be estimated. Hence, the trajectories of the target UAV can be reconstructed. Although both the target UAV and the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating BSs, it is demonstrated by experiments that the tracking errors are below 50 centimeters for 90% of the complicated trajectories, when the distances between the UAV and sensing receivers are less than 30 meters. Note this accuracy is significantly better than the ranging resolution of LTE signals, high-accuracy trajectory tracking for UAV might be feasible via multi-angle bistatic Doppler measurements if the receivers are deployed with a sufficient density.

Title: LocDreamer: World Model-Based Learning for Joint Indoor Tracking and Anchor Scheduling
Authors: Geng Wang, Zhouyou Gu, Shenghong Li, Peng Cheng, Jihong Park, Branka Vucetic, Yonghui Li
Abstract: Accurate, resource-efficient localization and tracking enables numerous location-aware services in next-generation wireless networks. However, existing machine learning-based methods often require large labeled datasets while overlooking spectrum and energy efficiencies. To fill this gap, we propose LocDreamer, a world model (WM)-based framework for joint target tracking and scheduling of localization anchors. LocDreamer learns a WM that captures the latent representation of the target motion and localization environment, thereby generating synthetic measurements to imagine arbitrary anchor deployments. These measurements enable imagination-driven training of both the tracking model and the reinforcement learning (RL)-based anchor scheduler that activates only the most informative anchors, which significantly reduce energy and signaling costs while preserving high tracking accuracy. Experiments on a real-world indoor dataset demonstrate that LocDreamer substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, outperforming conventional Bayesian filter with random scheduling by 37% in tracking accuracy, and achieving 86% of the accuracy of same model trained directly on real data.

Title: Riemannian Manifold Optimization for Advanced Wireless Communications: Fundamentals and Applications
Authors: Siwen Li, Jiacheng Chen, Yunting Xu, Shaofeng Li, Le Yao, Jieling Wang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Next-generation wireless communications promise transformative technologies such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and fluid antenna systems (FAS). However, deploying these technologies is hindered by large-scale optimization problems with nonconvex constraints. Conventional Euclidean-space methods rely on approximations or relaxations, which degrade performance and incur substantial computational costs. Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) offers a powerful alternative that directly operates on the manifold defined by the geometric constraints. This approach inherently satisfies the constraints at every optimization step, thereby avoiding the performance degradation and substantial computational costs. In this paper, we first elaborate on the principles of RMO, including the fundamental concepts, tools, and methods, emphasizing its effectiveness for nonconvex problems. We then introduce its applications in advanced wireless communications, showing how constrained problems are reformulated on their natural manifolds and solved using tailored RMO algorithms. Furthermore, we present a case study on secure beamforming in an FAS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, demonstrating RMO's superiority over conventional methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.

Title: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Image Reconstruction and Synthesis using Denoising Diffusion Models
Authors: Weijie Gan, Xucheng Wang, Tongyao Wang, Wenshang Wang, Chunwei Ying, Yuyang Hu, Yasheng Chen, Hongyu An, Ulugbek S. Kamilov
Abstract: Image reconstruction and image synthesis are important for handling incomplete multimodal imaging data, but existing methods require various task-specific models, complicating training and deployment workflows. We introduce Any2all, a unified framework that addresses this limitation by formulating these disparate tasks as a single virtual inpainting problem. We train a single, unconditional diffusion model on the complete multimodal data stack. This model is then adapted at inference time to ``inpaint'' all target modalities from any combination of inputs of available clean images or noisy measurements. We validated Any2all on a PET/MR/CT brain dataset. Our results show that Any2all can achieve excellent performance on both multimodal reconstruction and synthesis tasks, consistently yielding images with competitive distortion-based performance and superior perceptual quality over specialized methods.

Title: Towards Optimal Semantic Communications: Reconsidering the Role of Semantic Feature Channels
Authors: Yongjeong Oh, Jihong Park, Jinho Choi, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of transmitting the encoder outputs, termed semantic features (SFs), in semantic communication (SC). We begin by modeling the entire communication process from the encoder output to the decoder input, encompassing the physical channel and all transceiver operations, as the SF channel, thereby establishing an encoder-SF channel-decoder pipeline. In contrast to prior studies that assume a fixed SF channel, we note that the SF channel is configurable, as its characteristics are shaped by various transmission and reception strategies, such as power allocation. Based on this observation, we formulate the SF channel optimization problem under a mutual information constraint between the SFs and their reconstructions, and analytically derive the optimal SF channel under a linear encoder-decoder structure and Gaussian source assumption. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a joint optimization framework for the encoder-decoder and SF channel, applicable to both analog and digital SCs. To realize the optimized SF channel, we also propose a physical-layer calibration strategy that enables real-time power control and adaptation to varying channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SF channel optimization achieves superior task performance under various communication environments.

Title: Pitot-Aided Attitude and Air Velocity Estimation with Almost Global Asymptotic Stability Guarantees
Authors: Melone Nyoba Tchonkeu, Soulaimane Berkane, Tarek Hamel
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of attitude and air velocity estimation for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using IMU measurements and at least one Pitot tube measurement, with almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) guarantees. A cascade observer architecture is developed, in which a Riccati/Kalman-type filter estimates the body-fixed frame air velocity and the vehicle's tilt using IMU data as inputs and Pitot measurements as outputs. Under mild excitation conditions, the resulting air velocity and tilt estimation error dynamics are shown to be uniformly observable. The estimated tilt is then combined with magnetometer measurements in a nonlinear observer on SO(3) to recover the full attitude. Rigorous analysis establishes AGAS of the overall cascade structure under the uniform observability (UO) condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through validation on real flight data.

Title: Cross-Modal Bottleneck Fusion For Noise Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition
Authors: Seaone Ok, Min Jun Choi, Eungbeom Kim, Seungu Han, Kyogu Lee
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages both acoustic and visual cues to improve speech recognition under noisy conditions. A central question is how to design a fusion mechanism that allows the model to effectively exploit visual information when the audio signal is degraded, while maintaining strong performance on clean speech. We propose CoBRA (Cross-modal Bottleneck for Robust AVSR), a bottleneck-based fusion framework that introduces a compact set of learnable tokens to mediate cross-modal exchange. By regulating information flow through these tokens, the audio stream can reliably access essential visual cues even under adverse or out-of-domain noise. Despite limited training data, our model surpasses comparable baselines and remains competitive with large-scale systems through noise-adaptive fusion, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness. Ablation studies highlight that the depth of fusion is the most critical factor, underscoring its importance in designing robust AVSR systems.

Title: Experimental Realization of Koopman-Model Predictive Control for an AC-DC Converter
Authors: Shun Hirose, Shiu Mochiyama, Yoshihiko Susuki
Abstract: This paper experimentally demonstrates the Koopman-Model Predictive Control (K-MPC) for a real AC-DC converter. The converter is typically modeled with a nonlinear time-variant plant. We introduce a new dynamical approach to lifting measurable dynamics from the plant and constructing a linear time-invariant model that is consistent with control objectives of the converter. We show that the lifting approach, combined with the K-MPC controller, performs well across the full experimental system and outperforms existing control strategies in terms of both steady-state and transient responses.

Title: Beam Alignment in Multipath Environments for Integrated Sensing and Communication using Bandit Learning
Authors: Akanksha Sneh, Shobha Sundar Ram, Sumit J Darak, Aakanksha Tewari
Abstract: Prior works have explored multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms for the selection of optimal beams for millimeter-wave (mmW) communications between base station and mobile users. However, when the number of beams is large, the existing MAB algorithms are characterized by long exploration times, resulting in poor overall communication throughput. In this work, we propose augmenting the upper confidence bound (UCB) based MAB with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to address this limitation. The premise of the work is that the radar and communication functionalities share the same field-of-view and that communication mobile users are detected by the radar as mobile targets. The radar information is used for significantly reducing the number of candidate beams for the UCB, resulting in an overall reduction in the exploration time. Further, the radar information is used to estimate the realignment time in quasi-stationary scenarios. We have realized the MAB and radar signal processing algorithms on the system on chip (SoC) via hardware-software co-design (HSCD) and fixed-point analysis. We demonstrate the significant gain in execution time using accelerators. The simulations consider complex propagation channels involving direct and multipath, with simple and extended radar targets in the presence of significant static clutter. The resulting experiments show that the proposed ISAC-based MAB achieves a 35% reduction in the overall exploration time and 1.4 factor higher throughput as compared to the conventional MAB that is based only on communications.

Title: IEEE 802.11ad-Aided 5-D Sensing with a UAV Swarm in Urban Environment
Authors: Akanksha Sneh, Shobha Sundar Ram, Kumar Vijay Mishra
Abstract: Aerial base stations mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) support next-generation wireless networks in challenging environments such as urban areas, disaster zones, and remote locations. Further, UAV swarms overcome the challenges of limited battery life and other operational constraints of a single UAV. However, tracking mobile users on the ground by each UAV and the corresponding synchronization between the UAVs is a significant issue that must be addressed before this framework can be deployed in reality. Incorporating additional sensing capabilities to facilitate this additional requirement would introduce significant overhead in terms of hardware, cost, and power to each UAV. Instead, we propose an integrated sensing and communications-enabled swarm UAV system, based on the millimeter-wave IEEE 802.11ad protocol. Further, we show that our proposed system is capable of five-dimensional (5-D) ground target sensing (range, Doppler velocity, azimuth, elevation, and polarization) in an urban environment. Numerical experiments using realistic models demonstrate and validate the performance of 5-D sensing using our proposed 802-11ad-aided UAV system.

Title: Movable Antenna Enabled Reconfigurable Array Topologies for Structured Beam Communications
Authors: Hongyun Jin, Wenchi Cheng, Jingqing Wang
Abstract: Spatially structured beams have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing spectrum efficiency (SE) in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, structured beam schemes based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs) fail to fully exploit the array aperture, thereby limiting their topological reconfigurability and adaptability to diverse communication scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications.

Title: Reconfigurable Low-Complexity Architecture for High Resolution Doppler Velocity Estimation in Integrated Sensing and Communication System
Authors: Aakanksha Tewari, Samarth Sharma Bhardwaj, Sumit J Darak, Shobha Sundar Ram
Abstract: In millimeter wave integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for intelligent transportation, radar and communication share spectrum and hardware in a time division manner. Radar rapidly detects and localizes mobile users (MUs), after which communication proceeds through narrow beams identified by radar. Achieving fine Doppler resolution for MU clutter discrimination requires long coherent processing intervals, reducing communication time and throughput. To address this, we propose a reconfigurable architecture for Doppler estimation realized on a system on chip using hardware software codesign. The architecture supports algorithm level reconfiguration, dynamically switching between low-complexity, high-speed FFT-based coarse estimation and high complexity ESPRIT based fine estimation. We introduce modifications to ESPRIT that achieve 6.7 times faster execution while reducing memory and multiplier usage by 79% and 63%, respectively, compared to state of the art approaches, without compromising accuracy. Additionally, the reconfigurable architecture can switch to lower slow time packets under high SNR conditions, improving latency further by 2 times with no loss in performance.

Title: An Approach for the Qualitative Graphical Representation of the Describing Function in Nonlinear Systems Stability Analysis
Authors: Davide Tebaldi, Roberto Zanasi
Abstract: The describing function method is a useful tool for the qualitative analysis of limit cycles in the stability analysis of nonlinear systems. This method is inherently approximate; therefore, it should be used for a fast qualitative analysis of the considered systems. However, plotting the exact describing function requires heavy mathematical calculations, reducing interest in this method especially from the point of view of control education. The objective of this paper is to enhance the describing function method by providing a new approach for the qualitative plotting of the describing function for piecewise nonlinearities involving discontinuities. Unlike the standard method, the proposed approach allows for a straightforward, hand-drawn plotting of the describing function using the rules introduced in this paper, simply by analyzing the shape of the nonlinearity. The proposed case studies show that the limit cycles estimation performed using the standard exact plotting of the describing function yields the same qualitative results as those obtained using the proposed qualitative method for plotting the describing function.

Title: Symbol Rate Maximization in Rolling-Shutter OCC: Design and Implementation Considerations
Authors: Xinyu Zhang, Alexis A. Dowhuszko, Miguel Rêgo, Pedro Fonseca, Luís Nero Alves, Jyri Hämäläinen, Risto Wichman
Abstract: Optical Camera Communication (OCC) systems can take advantage of the row-by-row scanning process of rolling-shutter cameras to capture the fast variations of light intensity coming from Visible Light Communication (VLC) LED-based transmitters. In order to study the maximum data rate that is feasible in such kind of OCC systems, this paper presents its equivalent digital communication system model in which the rolling-shutter camera is modeled as a rectangular matched-filter whose time width is equal to the exposure time of the camera, followed by a sampling process at the pixel row sweep rate of the camera. Based on the proposed rolling-shutter camera model, the maximum symbol rate that such OCC systems can support is experimentally demonstrated, and the impact of imperfect time synchronization between the VLC transmitter and the rolling-shutter OCC receiver is characterized in the form of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). The equivalent three-tap channel model that results from this process is experimentally validated and the generated ISI is compensated with the use of linear equalization in reception. Simulation and experimental results show a strong correlation between them, demonstrating that the proposed approach can be used to make the OCC system work at the Nyquist sampling rate, which is equivalent to the pixel row sweep rate of the rolling-shutter camera used in reception.

Title: A Multi-physics Simulation Framework for High-power Microwave Counter-unmanned Aerial System Design and Performance Evaluation
Authors: Akbar Anbar Jafari, Gholamreza Anbarjafari
Abstract: The proliferation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) operating under autonomous guidance has created an urgent need for non-kinetic neutralization methods that are immune to conventional radio-frequency jamming. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-physics simulation framework for the design and performance evaluation of a high-power microwave (HPM) counter-UAS system operating at 2.45\,GHz. The framework integrates electromagnetic propagation modelling, antenna pattern analysis, electromagnetic coupling to unshielded drone wiring harnesses, and a sigmoid-based semiconductor damage probability model calibrated to published CMOS latchup thresholds. A 10{,}000-trial Monte Carlo analysis incorporating stochastic variations in transmitter power, antenna pointing error, target wire orientation, polarization mismatch, and component damage thresholds yields system-level kill probabilities with 95\% confidence intervals. For a baseline configuration of 25\,kW continuous-wave power and a 60\,cm parabolic reflector (21.2\,dBi gain), the Monte Carlo simulation predicts a kill probability of $51.4\pm1.0$\% at 20\,m, decreasing to $13.1\pm0.7$\% at 40\,m. Pulsed operation at 500\,kW peak power (1\% duty cycle) extends the 90\% kill range from approximately 18\,m to 88\,m. The framework further provides parametric design maps, safety exclusion zone calculations compliant with ICNIRP 2020 guidelines, thermal management requirements, and waveguide mode analysis. All simulation codes and results are provided for full reproducibility.

Title: Physics-Guided Variational Model for Unsupervised Sound Source Tracking
Authors: Luan Vinícius Fiorio, Ivana Nikoloska, Bruno Defraene, Alex Young, Johan David, Ronald M. Aarts
Abstract: Sound source tracking is often performed using classical array-processing algorithms. Alternative methods, such as machine learning, rely on ground truth position labels, which are costly to obtain. We propose a variational model that can perform single-source unsupervised sound source tracking in latent space, aided by a physics-based decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses traditional baselines and achieves performance and computational complexity comparable to state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that the method presents substantial robustness to altered microphone array geometries and corrupted microphone position metadata. Finally, the method is extended to multi-source sound tracking and the basic theoretical changes are proposed.

Title: Radar Operating Metrics and Network Throughput for Integrated Sensing and Communications in Millimeter-wave Urban Environments
Authors: Akanksha Sneh, Shobha Sundar Ram
Abstract: Millimeter wave integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are being researched for next-generation intelligent transportation systems. Here, radar and communication functionalities share a common spectrum and hardware resources in a time-multiplexed manner. The objective of the radar is to first scan the angular search space and detect and localize mobile users/targets in the presence of discrete clutter scatterers. Subsequently, this information is used to direct highly directional beams toward these mobile users for communication service. The choice of radar parameters such as the radar duty cycle and the corresponding beamwidth are critical for realizing high communication throughput. In this work, we use the stochastic geometry-based mathematical framework to analyze the radar operating metrics as a function of diverse radar, target, and clutter parameters and subsequently use these results to study the network throughput of the ISAC system. The results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Trajectory Stitching for Solving Inverse Problems with Flow-Based Models
Authors: Alexander Denker, Moshe Eliasof, Zeljko Kereta, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. One option is to directly optimize the initial latent code (noise), such that the flow output solves the inverse problem. However, this requires backpropagating through the entire generative trajectory, incurring high memory costs and numerical instability. We propose MS-Flow, which represents the trajectory as a sequence of intermediate latent states rather than a single initial code. By enforcing the flow dynamics locally and coupling segments through trajectory-matching penalties, MS-Flow alternates between updating intermediate latent states and enforcing consistency with observed data. This reduces memory consumption while improving reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-Flow over existing methods on image recovery and inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and computed tomography.

Title: DNS: Data-driven Nonlinear Smoother for Complex Model-free Process
Authors: Fredrik Cumlin, Anubhab Ghosh, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: We propose data-driven nonlinear smoother (DNS) to estimate a hidden state sequence of a complex dynamical process from a noisy, linear measurement sequence. The dynamical process is model-free, that is, we do not have any knowledge of the nonlinear dynamics of the complex process. There is no state-transition model (STM) of the process available. The proposed DNS uses a recurrent architecture that helps to provide a closed-form posterior of the hidden state sequence given the measurement sequence. DNS learns in an unsupervised manner, meaning the training dataset consists of only measurement data and no state data. We demonstrate DNS using simulations for smoothing of several stochastic dynamical processes, including a benchmark Lorenz system. Experimental results show that the DNS is significantly better than a deep Kalman smoother (DKS) and an iterative data-driven nonlinear state estimation (iDANSE) smoother.

Title: RFSoC-Based Integrated Navigation and Sensing Using NavIC
Authors: Riya Sachdeva, Aakanksha Tewari, Sumit J. Darak, Shobha Sundar Ram, Sanat K. Biswas
Abstract: Prior art has proposed a secondary application for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) infrastructure for remote sensing of ground-based and maritime targets. Here, a passive radar receiver is deployed to detect uncooperative targets on Earth's surface by capturing ground-reflected satellite signals. This work demonstrates a hardware prototype of an L-band Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) satellite-based remote sensing receiver system mounted on an AMD Zynq radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) platform. Two synchronized receiver channels are introduced for capturing the direct signal (DS) from the satellite and ground-reflected signal (GRS) returns from targets. These signals are processed on the ARM processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA) of the RFSoC to generate delay-Doppler maps of the ground-based targets. The performance is first validated in a loop-back configuration of the RFSoC. Next, the DS and GRS signals are emulated by the output from two ports of the Keysight Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and interfaced with the RFSoC where the signals are subsequently processed to obtain the delay-Doppler maps. The performance is validated for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

Title: Residential Peak Load Reduction via Direct Load Control under Limited Information
Authors: Katharina Kaiser, Gustavo Valverde, Gabriela Hug
Abstract: Thermostatically controlled loads and electric vehicles offer flexibility to reduce power peaks in low-voltage distribution networks. This flexibility can be maximized if the devices are coordinated centrally, given some level of information about the controlled devices. In this paper, we propose novel optimization-based control schemes with prediction capabilities that utilize limited information from heat pumps, electric water heaters, and electric vehicles. The objective is to flatten the total load curve seen by the distribution transformer by restricting the times at which the available flexible loads are allowed to operate, subject to the flexibility constraints of the loads to preserve customers' comfort. The original scheme was tested in a real-world setup, considering both winter and summer days. The pilot results confirmed the technical feasibility but also informed the design of an improved version of the controller. Computer simulations using the adjusted controller show that, compared to the original formulation, the improved scheme achieves greater peak reductions in summer. Additionally, comparisons were made with an ideal controller, which assumes perfect knowledge of the inflexible load profile, the models of the controlled devices, the hot water and space heating demand, and future electric vehicle charging sessions. The proposed scheme with limited information achieves almost half of the potential average daily peak reduction that the ideal controller with perfect knowledge would achieve.

Title: Ziv-Zakai Bound for Near-Field Localization and Sensing
Authors: Nicolò Decarli, Davide Dardari
Abstract: The increasing carrier frequencies and growing physical dimensions of antenna arrays in modern wireless systems are driving renewed interest in localization and sensing under near-field conditions. In this paper, we analyze the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for near-field localization and sensing operated with large antenna arrays, which offers a tighter characterization of estimation accuracy compared to traditional bounds such as the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB), especially in low signal-to-noise ratio or threshold regions. Leveraging spherical wavefront and array geometry in the signal model, we evaluate the ZZB for distance and angle estimation, investigating the dependence of the accuracy on key signal and system parameters such as array geometry, wavelength, and target position. Our analysis highlights the transition behavior of the ZZB and underscores the fundamental limitations and opportunities for accurate near-field sensing.

Title: A Primal-Dual-Based Active Fault-Tolerant Control Scheme for Cyber-Physical Systems: Application to DC Microgrids
Authors: Wasif H. Syed, Juan E. Machado, Johannes Schiffer
Abstract: We consider the problem of active fault-tolerant control in cyber-physical systems composed of strictly passive linear-time invariant dynamic subsystems. We cast the problem as a constrained optimization problem and propose an augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics-based fault-tolerant control framework that enforces network-level constraints and provides optimality guarantees for the post-fault steady-state operation. By suitably interconnecting the primal-dual algorithm with the cyber-physical dynamics, we provide sufficient conditions under which the resulting closed-loop system possesses a unique and exponentially stable equilibrium point that satisfies the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of the constrained problem. The framework's effectiveness is illustrated through numerical experiments on a DC microgrid.

Title: Input-Adaptive Spectral Feature Compression by Sequence Modeling for Source Separation
Authors: Kohei Saijo, Yoshiaki Bando
Abstract: Time-frequency domain dual-path models have demonstrated strong performance and are widely used in source separation. Because their computational cost grows with the number of frequency bins, these models often use the band-split (BS) module in high-sampling-rate tasks such as music source separation (MSS) and cinematic audio source separation (CASS). The BS encoder compresses frequency information by encoding features for each predefined subband. It achieves effective compression by introducing an inductive bias that places greater emphasis on low-frequency parts. Despite its success, the BS module has two inherent limitations: (i) it is not input-adaptive, preventing the use of input-dependent information, and (ii) the parameter count is large, since each subband requires a dedicated module. To address these issues, we propose Spectral Feature Compression (SFC). SFC compresses the input using a single sequence modeling module, making it both input-adaptive and parameter-efficient. We investigate two variants of SFC, one based on cross-attention and the other on Mamba, and introduce inductive biases inspired by the BS module to make them suitable for frequency information compression. Experiments on MSS and CASS tasks demonstrate that the SFC module consistently outperforms the BS module across different separator sizes and compression ratios. We also provide an analysis showing that SFC adaptively captures frequency patterns from the input.

Title: Improving Reliability of Hybrid Bit-Semantic Communications for Cellular Networks
Authors: Nikos G. Evgenidis, Sotiris A. Tegos, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Ioannis Krikidis, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have been considered as a promising solution to reduce the amount of transmitted information, thus paving the way for more energy-and spectrum-efficient wireless networks. Nevertheless, SemComs rely heavily on the utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) at the transceivers, which limit the accuracy between the original and reconstructed data and are challenging to implement in practice due to increased architecture complexity. Thus, hybrid cellular networks that utilize both conventional bit communications (BitComs) and SemComs have been introduced to bridge the gap between required and existing infrastructure. To facilitate such networks, in this work, we investigate reliability by deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the network. Additionally, we propose a generalized outage probability through which the cell radius that achieves a desired outage threshold for a specific range of users is calculated in closed form. Additionally, to consider the practical limitations caused by the specialized dedicated hardware and the increased memory and computational resources that are required to support SemCom, a semantic utilization metric is proposed. Based on this metric, we express the probability that a specific number of users select SemCom transmission and calculate the optimal cell radius for that number in closed form. Simulation results validate the derived analytical expressions and the characterized design properties of the cell radius found through the proposed metrics, providing useful insights.

Title: Stability and stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics via singular perturbation analysis
Authors: Luigi Romano, Ole Morten Aamo, Miroslav Krstić, Jan Åslund, Erik Frisk
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics, modeled as interconnections of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the long-standing practice of neglecting transient tire dynamics in vehicle modeling and control, a rigorous justification is provided for such simplifications using singular perturbation theory. A perturbation parameter, defined as the ratio between a characteristic rolling contact length and the vehicle's longitudinal speed, is introduced to formalize the time-scale separation between rigid-body motion and tire dynamics. For sufficiently small values of this parameter, it is demonstrated that standard finite-dimensional techniques can be applied to analyze the local stability of equilibria and to design stabilizing controllers. Both state-feedback and output-feedback designs are considered, under standard stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Whilst the proposed controllers follow classical approaches, the novelty of the work lies in establishing the first mathematical framework that rigorously connects distributed tire models with conventional vehicle dynamics. The results reconcile decades of empirical findings with a formal theoretical foundation and open new perspectives for the analysis and control of ODE-PDE systems with distributed friction in automotive applications.

Title: Efficient Brain Extraction of MRI Scans with Mild to Moderate Neuropathology
Authors: Hjalti Thrastarson, Lotta M. Ellingsen
Abstract: Skull stripping magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human brain is an important process in many image processing techniques, such as automatic segmentation of brain structures. Numerous methods have been developed to perform this task, however, they often fail in the presence of neuropathology and can be inconsistent in defining the boundary of the brain mask. Here, we propose a novel approach to skull strip T1-weighted images in a robust and efficient manner, aiming to consistently segment the outer surface of the brain, including the sulcal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while excluding the full extent of the subarachnoid space and meninges. We train a modified version of the U-net on silver-standard ground truth data using a novel loss function based on the signed-distance transform (SDT). We validate our model both qualitatively and quantitatively using held-out data from the training dataset, as well as an independent external dataset. The brain masks used for evaluation partially or fully include the subarachnoid space, which may introduce bias into the comparison; nonetheless, our model demonstrates strong performance on the held-out test data, achieving a consistent mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.964$\pm$0.006 and an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 1.4mm$\pm$0.2mm. Performance on the external dataset is comparable, with a DSC of 0.958$\pm$0.006 and an ASSD of 1.7$\pm$0.2mm. Our method achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art methods for brain extraction, particularly in its highly consistent preservation of the brain's outer surface. The method is publicly available on GitHub.

Title: Passivity-exploiting stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics
Authors: Luigi Romano, Ole Morten Aamo, Miroslav Krstić, Jan Åslund, Erik Frisk
Abstract: This paper addresses the local stabilization problem for semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics, represented as interconnections of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). A passivity-exploiting backstepping design is presented, which leverages the strict dissipativity properties of the PDE subsystem to achieve exponential stabilization of the considered ODE-PDE interconnection around a prescribed equilibrium. Sufficient conditions for local well-posedness and exponential convergence are derived by constructing a Lyapunov functional combining the lumped and distributed states. Both state-feedback and output-feedback controllers are synthesized, the latter relying on a cascaded observer. The theoretical results are corroborated with numerical simulations, considering non-ideal scenarios and accounting for external disturbances and uncertainties. Simulation results confirm that the proposed control strategy can effectively and robustly stabilize oversteer vehicles at high speeds, demonstrating the relevance of the approach for improving the safety and performance in automotive applications.

Title: Joint Channel Sounding and Source-Channel Coding for MIMO-OFDM Systems: Deep Unified Encoding and Parallel Flow-Matching Decoding
Authors: Hao Jiang, Xiaojun Yuan, Qinghua Guo
Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep unified (DU) encoder that embeds source information in a codeword that contains sufficient redundancy to handle both channel and source uncertainties, without enforcing an explicit pilot-data separation. At the receiver, we design a parallel flow-matching (PFM) decoder that leverages flow-based generative priors to jointly estimate the channel and the source, yielding much more efficient inference than the existing diffusion-based approaches. To benchmark performance limits, we derive the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) for the joint channel and source estimation problem. Extensive simulations over block-fading MIMO-OFDM channels demonstrate that the proposed DU-PFM approach drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both channel estimation accuracy and source reconstruction quality.

Title: Accelerated Stabilization of Switched Linear MIMO Systems using Generalized Homogeneity
Authors: Moussa Labbadi, Andrey Polyakov, Denis Efimov
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exponential and accelerated finite-time, as well as nearly fixed-time, stabilization of switched linear MIMO systems. The proposed approach relies on a generalized homogenization framework for switched linear systems and employs implicit Lyapunov functions for control design, covering both common and multiple Lyapunov function settings. Linear matrix equations and inequalities are derived to characterize the dilation generator and to synthesize the controller gains. Robustness of the resulting control laws with respect to system uncertainties and external disturbances is analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples.

Title: Denoise Stepwise Signals by Diffusion Model Based Approach
Authors: Xingdi Tong, Chenyu Wen
Abstract: Stepwise signals are ubiquitous in single-molecule detections, where abrupt changes in signal levels typically correspond to molecular conformational changes or state transitions. However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions.

Title: Automating the Wildfire Detection and Scheduling Pipeline with Maneuverable Earth Observation Satellites
Authors: Brycen D. Pearl, Joshua G. Warner, Hang Woon Lee
Abstract: Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent, with potentially devastating consequences, including loss of life, infrastructure destruction, and severe environmental damage. Low Earth orbit satellites equipped with onboard sensors can capture critical imagery of active wildfires and enable real-time detection through machine learning algorithms applied to the acquired data. This paper presents a framework that automates the complete wildfire detection and scheduling pipeline, integrating three key components: wildfire detection in satellite imagery, statistical updating that incorporates data from repeated flyovers, and multi-satellite scheduling optimization. The framework enables wildfire detection using convolutional neural networks with sensor fusion techniques, the incorporation of subsequent flyover information using Bayesian statistics, and satellite scheduling through the state-of-the-art Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem. Experiments conducted using real-world wildfire events and operational Earth observation satellites demonstrate that this autonomous detection and scheduling approach effectively enhances wildfire monitoring capabilities.

Title: Artificial Magnetic Conductor Frame to Improve Impedance Matching and Radiation Symmetry in 2$\times$2 Array for 6G Applications
Authors: Edoardo Giusti, Krishan Kumar Tiwari, C.J. Reddy, Danilo Brizi, Agostino Monorchio, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: An Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) frame capable of improving the impedance matching of a 2$\times$2 array for 6G applications without degrading isolation performance is presented. The proposed frame is integrated into the array without modifying the single radiating element design. By relying on accurate full-wave simulations, it results that the addition of the frame restores the impedance matching performance, achieving a bandwidth of 1.5 GHz at 28 GHz. The isolation between each port remains under -15 dB within the operating band, thanks to the vias in the rectangular patch metasurface. Moreover, the overall structure exhibits a gain of 11.81 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 69$\%$, satisfactorily for broadband communication purposes. The proposed AMC frame represents an effective method for improving array performance without the need to alter the shape or dimensions of the single radiating element.

Title: Contraction Metric Based Safe Reinforcement Learning Force Control for a Hydraulic Actuator with Real-World Training
Authors: Lucca Maitan, Lucas Toschi, Cícero Zanette, Elisa G. Vergamini, Leonardo F. Santos, Thiago Boaventura
Abstract: Force control in hydraulic actuators is notoriously difficult due to strong nonlinearities, uncertainties, and the high risks associated with unsafe exploration during learning. This paper investigates safe reinforcement learning (RL) for hy draulic force control with real-world training using contraction metric certificates. A data-driven model of a hydraulic actuator, identified from experimental data, is employed for simulation based pretraining of a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy that adapts the PI gains of a feedback-linearization (FL) controller. To reduce instability during online training, we propose a quadratic-programming (QP) contraction filter that leverages a learned contraction metric to enforce approximate exponential convergence of trajectories, applying minimal corrections to the policy output. The approach is validated on a hydraulic test bench, where the RL controller is trained directly on hardware and benchmarked against a simulation-trained agent and a fixed-gain baseline. Experimental results show that real-hardware training improves force-tracking performance compared to both alternatives, while the contraction filter mitigates chattering and instabilities. These findings suggest that contraction-based certificates can enable safe RL in high force hydraulic systems, though robustness at extreme operating conditions remains a challenge.

Title: LangGS-SLAM: Real-Time Language-Feature Gaussian Splatting SLAM
Authors: Seongbo Ha, Sibaek Lee, Kyungsu Kang, Joonyeol Choi, Seungjun Tak, Hyeonwoo Yu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a RGB-D SLAM system that reconstructs a language-aligned dense feature field while sustaining low-latency tracking and mapping. First, we introduce a Top-K Rendering pipeline, a high-throughput and semantic-distortion-free method for efficiently rendering high-dimensional feature maps. To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS. Our results demonstrate that online SLAM with dense, uncompressed language-aligned feature fields is both feasible and effective, bridging the gap between 3D perception and language-based reasoning.

Title: Curriculum-Learned Vanishing Stacked Residual PINNs for Hyperbolic PDE State Reconstruction
Authors: Katayoun Eshkofti, Matthieu Barreau
Abstract: Modeling distributed dynamical systems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to discontinuities and shocks that hinder the convergence of traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recently proposed vanishing stacked residual PINN (VSR-PINN) embeds a vanishing-viscosity mechanism within stacked residual refinements to enable a smooth transition from the parabolic to hyperbolic regime. This paper integrates three curriculum-learning methods as primal-dual (PD) optimization, causality progression, and adaptive sampling into the VSR-PINN. The PD strategy balances physics and data losses, the causality scheme unlocks deeper stacks by respecting temporal and gradient evolution, and adaptive sampling targets high residuals. Numerical experiments on traffic reconstruction confirm that enforcing causality systematically reduces the median point-wise MSE and its variability across runs, yielding improvements of nearly one order of magnitude over non-causal training in both the baseline and PD variants.

Title: MAU-GPT: Enhancing Multi-type Industrial Anomaly Understanding via Anomaly-aware and Generalist Experts Adaptation
Authors: Zhuonan Wang, Zhenxuan Fan, Siwen Tan, Yu Zhong, Yuqian Yuan, Haoyuan Li, Hao Jiang, Wenqiao Zhang, Feifei Shao, Hongwei Wang, Jun Xiao
Abstract: As industrial manufacturing scales, automating fine-grained product image analysis has become critical for quality control. However, existing approaches are hindered by limited dataset coverage and poor model generalization across diverse and complex anomaly patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce MAU-Set, a comprehensive dataset for Multi-type industrial Anomaly Understanding. It spans multiple industrial domains and features a hierarchical task structure, ranging from binary classification to complex reasoning. Alongside this dataset, we establish a rigorous evaluation protocol to facilitate fair and comprehensive model assessment. Building upon this foundation, we further present MAU-GPT, a domain-adapted multimodal large model specifically designed for industrial anomaly understanding. It incorporates a novel AMoE-LoRA mechanism that unifies anomaly-aware and generalist experts adaptation, enhancing both understanding and reasoning across diverse defect classes. Extensive experiments show that MAU-GPT consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all domains, demonstrating strong potential for scalable and automated industrial inspection.

Title: Robust and Real-Time Bangladeshi Currency Recognition: A Dual-Stream MobileNet and EfficientNet Approach
Authors: Subreena, Mohammad Amzad Hossain, Mirza Raquib, Saydul Akbar Murad, Farida Siddiqi Prity, Muhammad Hanif, Nick Rahimi
Abstract: Accurate currency recognition is essential for assistive technologies, particularly for visually impaired individuals who rely on others to identify banknotes. This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 97.95% accuracy on controlled datasets, 92.84% on complex backgrounds, and 94.98% accuracy when combining all datasets. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and seven metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, and AUC. Additionally, explainable AI methods like LIME and SHAP are incorporated to enhance transparency and interpretability.

Title: Deep Learning Based Multi-Level Classification for Aviation Safety
Authors: Elaheh Sabziyan Varnousfaderani, Syed A. M. Shihab, Jonathan King
Abstract: Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, often resulting in loss of life, severe aircraft damage, and substantial financial costs. Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds.

Title: MENASpeechBank: A Reference Voice Bank with Persona-Conditioned Multi-Turn Conversations for AudioLLMs
Authors: Zien Sheikh Ali, Hunzalah Hassan Bhatti, Rabindra Nath Nandi, Shammur Absar Chowdhury, Firoj Alam
Abstract: Audio large language models (AudioLLMs) enable instruction-following over speech and general audio, but progress is increasingly limited by the lack of diverse, conversational, instruction-aligned speech-text data. This bottleneck is especially acute for persona-grounded interactions and dialectal coverage, where collecting and releasing real multi-speaker recordings is costly and slow. We introduce MENASpeechBank, a reference speech bank comprising about 18K high-quality utterances from 124 speakers spanning multiple MENA countries, covering English, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and regional Arabic varieties. Building on this resource, we develop a controllable synthetic data pipeline that: (i) constructs persona profiles enriched with World Values Survey-inspired attributes, (ii) defines a taxonomy of about 5K conversational scenarios, (iii) matches personas to scenarios via semantic similarity, (iv) generates about 417K role-play conversations with an LLM where the user speaks as the persona and the assistant behaves as a helpful agent, and (v) synthesizes the user turns by conditioning on reference speaker audio to preserve speaker identity and diversity. We evaluate both synthetic and human-recorded conversations and provide detailed analysis. We will release MENASpeechBank and the generated conversations publicly for the community.

Title: Toward Accurate and Accessible Markerless Neuronavigation
Authors: Ziye Xie, Oded Schlesinger, Raj Kundu, Jessica Y. Choi, Pablo Iturralde, Dennis A. Turner, Stefan M. Goetz, Guillermo Sapiro, Angel V. Peterchev, J. Matias Di Martino
Abstract: Neuronavigation is widely used in biomedical research and interventions to guide the precise placement of instruments around the head to support procedures such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Traditional systems, however, rely on subject-mounted markers that require manual registration, may shift during procedures, and can cause discomfort. We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01°$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results. The results suggest that integration of the data from the various camera sensors can improve the overall accuracy further. The proposed markerless neuronavigation methods can reduce setup cost and complexity, improve patient comfort, and expand access to neuronavigation in clinical and research settings.

Title: Airspace-aware Contingency Landing Planning
Authors: H. Emre Tekaslan, Ella M. Atkins
Abstract: This paper develops a real-time, search-based aircraft contingency landing planner that minimizes traffic disruptions while accounting for ground risk. The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.

Title: Learning Nonlinear Systems In-Context: From Synthetic Data to Real-World Motor Control
Authors: Tong Jian, Tianyu Dai, Tao Yu
Abstract: LLMs have shown strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities, but have not yet been extended to signal processing systems. Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines. These results demonstrate that ICL can bridge synthetic pretraining and real-world adaptability, opening new directions for data efficient control of physical systems.

Title: Optimizing Chlorination in Water Distribution Systems via Surrogate-assisted Neuroevolution
Authors: Rivaaj Monsia, Daniel Young, Olivier Francon, Risto Miikkulainen
Abstract: Ensuring the microbiological safety of large, heterogeneous water distribution systems (WDS) typically requires managing appropriate levels of disinfectant residuals including chlorine. WDS include complex fluid interactions that are nonlinear and noisy, making such maintenance a challenging problem for traditional control algorithms. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to this problem based on neuroevolution, multi-objective optimization, and surrogate modeling. Neural networks were evolved with NEAT to inject chlorine at strategic locations in the distribution network at select times. NSGA-II was employed to optimize four objectives: minimizing the total amount of chlorine injected, keeping chlorine concentrations homogeneous across the network, ensuring that maximum concentrations did not exceed safe bounds, and distributing the injections regularly over time. Each network was evaluated against a surrogate model, i.e. a neural network trained to emulate EPANET, an industry-level hydraulic WDS simulator that is accurate but infeasible in terms of computational cost to support machine learning. The evolved controllers produced a diverse range of Pareto-optimal policies that could be implemented in practice, outperforming standard reinforcement learning methods such as PPO. The results thus suggest a pathway toward improving urban water systems, and highlight the potential of using evolution with surrogate modeling to optimize complex real-world systems.

Title: Why Look at It at All?: Vision-Free Multifingered Blind Grasping Using Uniaxial Fingertip Force Sensing
Authors: Edgar Lee, Junho Choi, Taemin Kim, Changjoo Nam, Seokhwan Jeong
Abstract: Grasping under limited sensing remains a fundamental challenge for real-world robotic manipulation, as vision and high-resolution tactile sensors often introduce cost, fragility, and integration complexity. This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems.

Title: Perspective-aware fusion of incomplete depth maps and surface normals for accurate 3D reconstruction
Authors: Ondrej Hlinka, Georg Kaniak, Christian Kapeller
Abstract: We address the problem of reconstructing 3D surfaces from depth and surface normal maps acquired by a sensor system based on a single perspective camera. Depth and normal maps can be obtained through techniques such as structured-light scanning and photometric stereo, respectively. We propose a perspective-aware log-depth fusion approach that extends existing orthographic gradient-based depth-normals fusion methods by explicitly accounting for perspective projection, leading to metrically accurate 3D reconstructions. Additionally, the method handles missing depth measurements by leveraging available surface normal information to inpaint gaps. Experiments on the DiLiGenT-MV data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the importance of perspective-aware depth-normals fusion.

Title: NOMA-Assisted Multi-BS MEC Networks for Delay-Sensitive and Computation-Intensive IoT Applications
Authors: Yuang Chen, Fengqian Guo, Chang Wu, Mingyu Peng, Hancheng Lu, Chang Wen Chen
Abstract: The burgeoning and ubiquitous deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape struggles with ultra-low latency demands for computation-intensive tasks in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose an innovative uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-base station (BS) mobile edge computing (BS-MEC) network tailored for massive IoT connectivity. To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed EPG-JDM algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms and classic heuristic algorithms, yielding performance improvements of up to 19.3% and 14.7% in terms of total delay and power consumption, respectively.

Title: Information Theoretic Modeling of Interspecies Molecular Communication
Authors: Bitop Maitra, Murat Kuscu, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Plants and insects communicate using chemical signals like volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A plant encodes information using different blends of VOCs, which propagate through the air to represent different symbolic information. This communication occurs in a noisy environment, characterized by wind, distance, and complex biological reactions. At the receiver, cross-reactive olfactory receptors produce stochastic binding events whose discretized durations form the receiver observation. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework is developed to model interspecies molecular communication (MC), where receptor responses are modeled probabilistically using a multinomial distribution. Numerical results show that the communication depends on environmental parameters such as wind speed, distance, and the number of released molecules. The proposed framework provides fundamental insights into the VOC-based interspecies communication under realistic biological and environmental conditions.

Title: ODELoRA: Training Low-Rank Adaptation by Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
Authors: Yihang Gao, Vincent Y. F. Tan
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning method in deep transfer learning, due to its reduced number of trainable parameters and lower memory requirements enabled by Burer-Monteiro factorization on adaptation matrices. However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability.

Title: Transformer-based Hybrid Beamforming with Dynamic Subarray for Near-Space Airship-Borne Communications
Authors: Ruiqi Wang, Zhen Gao, Keke Ying, Ziwei Wan, Symeon Chatzinotas, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid beamforming framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in near-space airship-borne communications. To achieve high energy efficiency (EE) in energy-constraint airships, a dynamic subarray structure is introduced, where each radio frequency chain (RFC) is connected to a disjoint subset of the antennas according to channel state information (CSI). The proposed joint dynamic hybrid beamforming network (DyHBFNet) comprises three key components: 1) An analog beamforming network (ABFNet) that optimizes the analog beamforming matrices and provides auxiliary information for the antenna selection network (ASNet) design, 2) an ASNet that dynamically optimizes the connections between antennas and RFCs, and 3) a digital beamforming network (DBFNet) that optimizes digital beamforming matrices by employing a model-driven weighted minimum mean square error algorithm for improving beamforming performance and convergence speed. The proposed ABFNet, ASNet, and DBFNet are all designed based on advanced Transformer encoders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances spectral efficiency and EE compared to baseline schemes. Additionally, its robust performance under imperfect CSI makes it a scalable solution for practical implementations.

Authors: Mowmita Parvin Hera, Md. Shahriar Mahmud Kallol, Shohanur Rahman Nirob, Md. Badsha Bulbul, Jubayer Ahmed, M. Zhourul Islam, Hazrat Ali, Mohammmad Farhad Bulbul
Abstract: Accurate identification of cat breeds from images is a challenging task due to subtle differences in fur patterns, facial structure, and color. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for classifying cat breeds using a subset of the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which contains high-resolution images of various domestic breeds. We employed the Global Context Vision Transformer (GCViT) architecture-tiny for cat breed recognition. To improve model generalization, we used extensive data augmentation, including rotation, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustment. Experimental results show that the GCViT-Tiny model achieved a test accuracy of 92.00% and validation accuracy of 94.54%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for fine-grained image classification tasks. Potential applications include veterinary diagnostics, animal shelter management, and mobile-based breed recognition systems. We also provide a hugging face demo at this https URL.

Title: Affine Transformable Unmanned Ground Vehicle
Authors: Aron Mathias, Mohammad Ghufran, Jack Hughes, Hossein Rastgoftar
Abstract: This paper develops the proof of concept for a novel affine transformable unmanned ground vehicle (ATUGV) with the capability of safe and aggressive deformation while carrying multiple payloads. The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.

Title: Leader-following Consensus over Jointly Connected Switching Networks is Achievable for Exponentially Unstable Linear Systems
Authors: Yuhan Chen, Tao Liu, Jie Huang
Abstract: The leader-following consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks has been a challenging problem and the solvability of the problem has been limited to the class of linear multi-agent systems whose system matrix is marginally stable. This condition is restrictive since it even excludes the most commonly used double-integrator system. This paper presents a breakthrough by demonstrating that leader-following exponential consensus is achievable for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. The degree of instability can be explicitly characterized by two key quantities that arise from the jointly connected condition on a switching graph. By exploiting duality, we further show that the output-based distributed observer design problem for a general leader system is solvable over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. This is also in sharp contrast to the existing distributed observers, which rely on the assumption that the leader system is marginally stable.

Title: Picasso: Holistic Scene Reconstruction with Physics-Constrained Sampling
Authors: Xihang Yu, Rajat Talak, Lorenzo Shaikewitz, Luca Carlone
Abstract: In the presence of occlusions and measurement noise, geometrically accurate scene reconstructions -- which fit the sensor data -- can still be physically incorrect. For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.

Title: Spectral Guardrails for Agents in the Wild: Detecting Tool Use Hallucinations via Attention Topology
Authors: Valentin Noël
Abstract: Deploying autonomous agents in the wild requires reliable safeguards against tool use failures. We propose a training free guardrail based on spectral analysis of attention topology that complements supervised approaches. On Llama 3.1 8B, our method achieves 97.7\% recall with multi-feature detection and 86.1\% recall with 81.0\% precision for balanced deployment, without requiring any labeled training data. Most remarkably, we discover that single layer spectral features act as near-perfect hallucination detectors: Llama L26 Smoothness achieves 98.2\% recall (213/217 hallucinations caught) with a single threshold, and Mistral L3 Entropy achieves 94.7\% recall. This suggests hallucination is not merely a wrong token but a thermodynamic state change: the model's attention becomes noise when it errs. Through controlled cross-model evaluation on matched domains ($N=1000$, $T=0.3$, same General domain, hallucination rates 20--22\%), we reveal the ``Loud Liar'' phenomenon: Llama 3.1 8B's failures are spectrally catastrophic and dramatically easier to detect, while Mistral 7B achieves the best discrimination (AUC 0.900). These findings establish spectral analysis as a principled, efficient framework for agent safety.

Title: SNC: A Stem-Native Codec for Efficient Lossless Audio Storage with Adaptive Playback Capabilities
Authors: Shaad Sufi
Abstract: Current audio formats present a fundamental trade-off between file size and functionality: lossless formats like FLAC preserve quality but lack adaptability, while lossy formats reduce size at the cost of fidelity and offer no stem-level this http URL introduce the Stem-Native Codec (SNC), a novel audio container format that stores music as independently encoded stems plus a low-energy mastering residual. By exploiting the lower information entropy of separated stems compared to mixed audio, SNC achieves a 38.2% file size reduction versus FLAC (7.76 MB vs. 12.55 MB for a 2:18 test track) while maintaining perceptual transparency (STOI = 0.996). Unlike existing formats, SNC enables context-aware adaptive playback, spatial audio rendering, and user-controlled remixing without requiring additional storage. Our experimental validation demonstrates that the stems-plus residual architecture successfully decouples the conflicting requirements of compression efficiency and feature richness, offering a practical path toward next-generation audio distribution systems.

Title: Optimal Transmit Beamforming for MIMO ISAC with Unknown Target and User Locations
Authors: Yizhuo Wang, Shuowen Zhang
Abstract: This paper studies a challenging scenario in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where the locations of the sensing target and the communication user are both unknown and random, while only their probability distribution information is known. In this case, how to fully utilize the spatial resources by designing the transmit beamforming such that both sensing and communication can achieve satisfactory performance statistically is a difficult problem, which motivates the study in this paper. Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations. Furthermore, due to the need to cater to multiple target/user locations, we investigate whether dynamically employing different beamforming designs over different time slots improves the performance. It is proven that using a static beamforming strategy is sufficient for achieving the optimal performance. Numerical results validate our analysis, show that ISAC performance improves as the target/user location distributions become similar, and provide useful insights on the BS-user/-target association strategy.

Title: Controlled Flight of an Insect-Scale Flapping-Wing Robot via Integrated Onboard Sensing and Computation
Authors: Yi-Hsuan Hsiao, Quang Phuc Kieu, Zhongtao Guan, Suhan Kim, Jiaze Cai, Owen Matteson, Jonathan P. How, Elizabeth Farrell Helbling, YuFeng Chen
Abstract: Aerial insects can effortlessly navigate dense vegetation, whereas similarly sized aerial robots typically depend on offboard sensors and computation to maintain stable flight. This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.

Title: Hierarchical Subcode Ensemble Decoding of Polar Codes
Authors: Yubeen Jo, Geon Choi, Chanho Park, Namyoon Lee
Abstract: Subcode-ensemble decoders improve iterative decoding by running multiple decoders in parallel over carefully chosen subcodes, increasing the likelihood that at least one decoder avoids the dominant trapping structures. Achieving strong diversity gains, however, requires constructing many subcodes that satisfy a linear covering property-yet existing approaches lack a systematic way to scale the ensemble size while preserving this property. This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP. Simulations confirm that HSCED delivers significant block-error-rate improvements over standard BP and conventional subcode-ensemble decoding under the same decoding-latency constraint.

Title: Optimizing Spectral Prediction in MXene-Based Metasurfaces Through Multi-Channel Spectral Refinement and Savitzky-Golay Smoothing
Authors: Shujaat Khan, Waleed Iqbal Waseer
Abstract: The prediction of electromagnetic spectra for MXene-based solar absorbers is a computationally intensive task, traditionally addressed using full-wave solvers. This study introduces an efficient deep learning framework incorporating transfer learning, multi-channel spectral refinement (MCSR), and Savitzky-Golay smoothing to accelerate and enhance spectral prediction accuracy. The proposed architecture leverages a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, fine-tuned to predict 102-point absorption spectra from $64\times64$ metasurface designs. Additionally, the MCSR module processes the feature map through multi-channel convolutions, enhancing feature extraction, while Savitzky-Golay smoothing mitigates high-frequency noise. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deformable CNN models, achieving an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0245, coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) of 0.9578, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.98 dB. The proposed framework presents a scalable and computationally efficient alternative to conventional solvers, positioning it as a viable candidate for rapid spectral prediction in nanophotonic design workflows.

Title: Post-Collision Trajectory Restoration for a Single-track Ackermann Vehicle using Heuristic Steering and Tractive Force Functions
Authors: Samsaptak Ghosh, M. Felix Orlando, Sohom Chakrabarty
Abstract: Post-collision trajectory restoration is a safety-critical capability for autonomous vehicles, as impact-induced lateral motion and yaw transients can rapidly drive the vehicle away from the intended path. This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.

Title: A Comparative Analysis of the CERN ATLAS ITk MOPS Readout: A Feasibility Study on Production and Development Setups
Authors: Lukas Flad, Felix Sebastian Nitz, Tobias Krawutschke
Abstract: The upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitates a complete replacement of the ATLAS Inner Detector with the new Inner Tracker (ITk). This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector. A critical component of the ITk DCS is the Monitoring of Pixel System (MOPS), which supervises the local voltages and temperatures of the new pixel detector modules. This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the "MOPS-Hub Mock-up"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based "MOPS-Hub" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS. A companion paper will present the experimental results and the comparative analysis obtained using this testbed.

Title: Multipoint Code-Weight Sphere Decoding: Parallel Near-ML Decoding for Short-Blocklength Codes
Authors: Yubeen Jo, Geon Choi, Yongjune Kim, Namyoon Lee
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) operate with short packets, where finite-blocklength effects make near-maximum-likelihood (near-ML) decoding desirable but often too costly. This paper proposes a two-stage near-ML decoding framework that applies to any linear block code. In the first stage, we run a low-complexity decoder to produce a candidate codeword and a cyclic redundancy check. When this stage succeeds, we terminate immediately. When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder attains near-ML performance for short-blocklength, low-rate codes while maintaining low decoding latency.

Title: GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing
Authors: Shih-Fang Chen, Jun-Cheng Chen, I-Hong Jhuo, Yen-Yu Lin
Abstract: Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.

Title: Rho-Perfect: Correlation Ceiling For Subjective Evaluation Datasets
Authors: Fredrik Cumlin
Abstract: Subjective ratings contain inherent noise that limits the model-human correlation, but this reliability issue is rarely quantified. In this paper, we present $\rho$-Perfect, a practical estimation of the highest achievable correlation of a model on subjectively rated datasets. We define $\rho$-Perfect to be the correlation between a perfect predictor and human ratings, and derive an estimate of the value based on heteroscedastic noise scenarios, a common occurrence in subjectively rated datasets. We show that $\rho$-Perfect squared estimates test-retest correlation and use this to validate the estimate. We demonstrate the use of $\rho$-Perfect on a speech quality dataset and show how the measure can distinguish between model limitations and data quality issues.

Title: FreqLens: Interpretable Frequency Attribution for Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Chi-Sheng Chen, Xinyu Zhang, En-Jui Kuo, Guan-Ying Chen, Qiuzhe Xie, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Time series forecasting models often lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in domains requiring explainable predictions. We propose \textsc{FreqLens}, an interpretable forecasting framework that discovers and attributes predictions to learnable frequency components. \textsc{FreqLens} introduces two key innovations: (1) \emph{learnable frequency discovery} -- frequency bases are parameterized via sigmoid mapping and learned from data with diversity regularization, enabling automatic discovery of dominant periodic patterns without domain knowledge; and (2) \emph{axiomatic frequency attribution} -- a theoretically grounded framework that provably satisfies Completeness, Faithfulness, Null-Frequency, and Symmetry axioms, with per-frequency attributions equivalent to Shapley values. On Traffic and Weather datasets, \textsc{FreqLens} achieves competitive or superior performance while discovering physically meaningful frequencies: all 5 independent runs discover the 24-hour daily cycle ($24.6 \pm 0.1$h, 2.5\% error) and 12-hour half-daily cycle ($11.8 \pm 0.1$h, 1.6\% error) on Traffic, and weekly cycles ($10\times$ longer than the input window) on Weather. These results demonstrate genuine frequency-level knowledge discovery with formal theoretical guarantees on attribution quality.

Title: karl. -- A Research Vehicle for Automated and Connected Driving
Authors: Jean-Pierre Busch, Lukas Ostendorf, Guido Linden, Lennart Reiher, Till Beemelmanns, Bastian Lampe, Timo Woopen, Lutz Eckstein
Abstract: As highly automated driving is transitioning from single-vehicle closed-access testing to commercial deployments of public ride-hailing in selected areas (e.g., Waymo), automated driving and connected cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) remain active fields of research. Even though simulation is omnipresent in the development and validation life cycle of automated and connected driving technology, the complex nature of public road traffic and software that masters it still requires real-world integration and testing with actual vehicles. Dedicated vehicles for research and development allow testing and validation of software and hardware components under real-world conditions early on. They also enable collecting and publishing real-world datasets that let others conduct research without vehicle access, and support early demonstration of futuristic use cases. In this paper, we present karl., our new research vehicle for automated and connected driving. Apart from major corporations, few institutions worldwide have access to their own L4-capable research vehicles, restricting their ability to carry out independent research. This paper aims to help bridge that gap by sharing the reasoning, design choices, and technical details that went into making karl. a flexible and powerful platform for research, engineering, and validation in the context of automated and connected driving.

Title: Quantum Riemannian Cubics with Obstacle Avoidance for Quantum Geometric Model Predictive Control
Authors: Leonardo Colombo
Abstract: We propose a geometric model predictive control framework for quantum systems subject to smoothness and state constraints. By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-preserving variational discretization enables receding-horizon implementation, and a Lyapunov-type stability result is established for the closed-loop system. The approach is illustrated on the Bloch sphere for a two-level quantum system, providing a viable pathway toward predictive feedback control of constrained quantum dynamics.

Title: ResSR: A Computationally Efficient Residual Approach to Super-Resolving Multispectral Images
Authors: Haley Duba-Sullivan, Emma J. Reid, Sophie Voisin, Charles A. Bouman, Gregery T. Buzzard
Abstract: Multispectral imaging sensors typically have wavelength-dependent resolution, which limits downstream processing. Consequently, researchers have proposed multispectral image super-resolution (MSI-SR) methods which upsample low-resolution bands to achieve a common resolution across all wavelengths. However, existing MSI-SR methods are computationally expensive because they require spatially regularized deconvolution and/or training-based methods. In this paper, we introduce ResSR, a computationally efficient MSI-SR method that achieves high-quality reconstructions by using spectral decomposition along with spatial residual correction. ResSR applies singular value decomposition to identify correlations across spectral bands, uses pixel-wise computation to upsample the MSI, and then applies a residual correction process to correct the high-spatial frequency components of the upsampled bands. While ResSR is formulated as the solution to a spatially-coupled optimization problem, we use pixel-wise regularization and derive an approximate non-iterative solution, resulting in a computationally efficient, non-iterative algorithm. Results on a combination of simulated and measured data show that ResSR is 2$\times$ to 10$\times$ faster than alternative MSI-SR algorithms, while producing comparable or better image quality.

Title: Joint Optimization of Pattern, Headway, and Fleet Size of Multiple Urban Transit Lines with Perceived Headway Consideration and Passenger Flow Allocation
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Draco Tong, Hani S. Mahmassani, Omer Verbas, Taner Cokyasar
Abstract: This study addresses the urban transit pattern design problem, optimizing stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes and periods simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers, assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in Chicago, IL, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 5.76% under single-route and multi-period multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without additional operational costs.

Title: A General Nonlinear Observer Design for Inertial Navigation Systems with Almost Global Stability Guarantees
Authors: Sifeddine Benahmed, Tarek Hamel, Soulaimane Berkane
Abstract: This paper studies nonlinear observer design for rigid-body extended pose estimation using inertial measurements and generic exteroceptive sensing. The estimation problem is formulated as a cascade architecture that separates translational dynamics from rotational kinematics while preserving the geometric constraint of attitude evolution on $SO(3)$. By embedding the inertial navigation model into a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) representation, we construct an observer composed of a Kalman-Bucy-type estimator for translational states and an auxiliary unconstrained attitude variable, coupled with a nonlinear geometric reconstruction filter evolving on $SO(3)$. The cascade interconnection is analyzed within a nonlinear systems framework. We prove that uniform observability of the LTV subsystem guarantees almost global asymptotic stability of the overall nonlinear observer. For a benchmark GPS landmark aided configuration, explicit sufficient conditions on admissible trajectories are derived to ensure uniform observability. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation framework.

Title: Sensor-Noise Mitigation in Extremum Seeking Control Using Adaptive Numerical Differentiation
Authors: Shashank Verma, Juan Augusto Paredes Salazar, Jhon Manuel Portella Delgado, Ankit Goel, Dennis S. Bernstein
Abstract: Extremum-seeking control (ESC) is widely used to optimize performance when the system dynamics are uncertain. However, sensitivity to sensor noise is a crucial issue in ESC implementation due to the use of high-pass filters or gradient estimators. To reduce the sensitivity of ESC to noise, this paper investigates the use of the recently developed adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) technique for numerical differentiation. In particular, this paper develops extremum-seeking control with adaptive input and state estimation (ESC/AISE), where AISE replaces the high-pass filter of ESC to improve performance under sensor noise. The effectiveness of ESC/AISE is illustrated via numerical examples.

Title: Clinical utility of foundation models in musculoskeletal MRI for biomarker fidelity and predictive outcomes
Authors: Gabrielle Hoyer, Michelle W Tong, Rupsa Bhattacharjee, Valentina Pedoia, Sharmila Majumdar
Abstract: Precision medicine in musculoskeletal imaging requires scalable measurement infrastructure. We developed a modular system that converts routine MRI into standardized quantitative biomarkers suitable for clinical decision support. Promptable foundation segmenters (SAM, SAM2, MedSAM) were fine-tuned across heterogeneous musculoskeletal datasets and coupled to automated detection for fully automatic prompting. Fine-tuned segmentations yielded clinically reliable measurements with high concordance to expert annotations across cartilage, bone, and soft tissue biomarkers. Using the same measurements, we demonstrate two applications: (i) a three-stage knee triage cascade that reduces verification workload while maintaining sensitivity, and (ii) 48-month landmark models that forecast knee replacement and incident osteoarthritis with favorable calibration and net benefit across clinically relevant thresholds. Our model-agnostic, open-source architecture enables independent validation and development. This work validates a pathway from automated measurement to clinical decision: reliable biomarkers drive both workload optimization today and patient risk stratification tomorrow, and the developed framework shows how foundation models can be operationalized within precision medicine systems.

Title: Towards Effective and Efficient Context-aware Nucleus Detection in Histopathology Whole Slide Images
Authors: Zhongyi Shui, Honglin Li, Yunlong Zhang, Yuxuan Sun, Yiwen Ye, Pingyi Chen, Ruizhe Guo, Lei Cui, Chenglu Zhu, Lin Yang
Abstract: Nucleus detection in histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is crucial for a broad spectrum of clinical applications. The gigapixel size of WSIs necessitates the use of sliding window methodology for nucleus detection. However, mainstream methods process each sliding window independently, which overlooks broader contextual information and easily leads to inaccurate predictions. To address this limitation, recent studies additionally crop a large Filed-of-View (LFoV) patch centered on each sliding window to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially increase whole-slide inference latency. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient context-aware nucleus detection approach. Specifically, instead of using LFoV patches, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf features of historically visited sliding windows, which greatly enhances the inference efficiency. Moreover, compared to LFoV patches used in previous works, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide finer-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the classification accuracy. To develop the proposed context-aware model, we utilize annotated patches along with their surrounding unlabeled patches for training. Beyond exploiting high-level tissue context from these surrounding regions, we design a post-training strategy that leverages abundant unlabeled nucleus samples within them to enhance the model's context adaptability. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Title: Vision Transformer for Intracranial Hemorrhage Classification in CT Scans Using an Entropy-Aware Fuzzy Integral Strategy for Adaptive Scan-Level Decision Fusion
Authors: Mehdi Hosseini Chagahi, Md. Jalil Piran, Niloufar Delfan, Behzad Moshiri, Jaber Hatam Parikhan
Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical medical emergency caused by the rupture of cerebral blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding within the skull. Accurate and timely classification of hemorrhage subtypes is essential for effective clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose an advanced pyramid vision transformer (PVT)-based model, leveraging its hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture both local and global spatial dependencies in brain CT scans. Instead of processing all extracted features indiscriminately, A SHAP-based feature selection method is employed to identify the most discriminative components, which are then used as a latent feature space to train a boosting neural network, reducing computational complexity. We introduce an entropy-aware aggregation strategy along with a fuzzy integral operator to fuse information across multiple CT slices, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable scan-level diagnosis by accounting for inter-slice dependencies. Experimental results show that our PVT-based framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and robustness. By combining SHAP-driven feature selection, transformer-based modeling, and an entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator for decision fusion, our method offers a scalable and computationally efficient AI-driven solution for automated ICH subtype classification.

Title: CFARNet: Learning-Based High-Resolution Multi-Target Detection for Rainbow Beam Radar
Authors: Qiushi Liang, Yeyue Cai, Jianhua Mo, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming, enabled by phase-time arrays (PTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CFARNet significantly outperforms a baseline combining CFAR and MUSIC, especially under low transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.

Title: Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation for Massive Connectivity: Where Message Passing Meets Score-Based Generative Priors
Authors: Chang Cai, Wenjun Jiang, Xiaojun Yuan, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Abstract: Massive connectivity supports the sporadic access of a vast number of devices without requiring prior permission from the base station (BS). In such scenarios, the BS must perform joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) prior to data reception. Message-passing algorithms have emerged as a prominent solution for JADCE under a Bayesian inference framework. The existing message-passing algorithms, however, typically rely on some hand-crafted and overly simplistic priors of the wireless channel, leading to significant channel estimation errors and reduced activity detection accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the problem of JADCE in a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) grant-free random access network. We propose to incorporate a more accurate channel prior learned by score-based generative models into message passing, so as to push towards the performance limit of JADCE. Specifically, we develop a novel turbo message passing (TMP) framework that models the entire channel matrix as a super node, rather than factorizing it element-wise. This design enables the seamless integration of score-based generative models as a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser. The variance of the denoiser, which is essential in message passing, can also be learned through score-based generative models. Our approach, termed score-based TMP for JADCE (STMP-JADCE), takes full advantages of the powerful generative prior and, meanwhile, benefits from the fast convergence speed of message passing. Numerical simulations show that STMP-JADCE drastically enhances the activity detection and channel estimation performance compared to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

Title: Pronunciation Editing for Finnish Speech using Phonetic Posteriorgrams
Authors: Zirui Li, Lauri Juvela, Mikko Kurimo
Abstract: Synthesizing second-language (L2) speech is potentially highly valued for L2 language learning experience and feedback. However, due to the lack of L2 speech synthesis datasets, it is difficult to synthesize L2 speech for low-resourced languages. In this paper, we provide a practical solution for editing native speech to approximate L2 speech and present PPG2Speech, a diffusion-based multispeaker Phonetic-Posteriorgrams-to-Speech model that is capable of editing a single phoneme without text alignment. We use Matcha-TTS's flow-matching decoder as the backbone, transforming Phonetic Posteriorgrams (PPGs) to mel-spectrograms conditioned on external speaker embeddings and pitch. PPG2Speech strengthens the Matcha-TTS's flow-matching decoder with Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) and Sway Sampling. We also propose a new task-specific objective evaluation metric, the Phonetic Aligned Consistency (PAC), between the edited PPGs and the PPGs extracted from the synthetic speech for editing effects. We validate the effectiveness of our method on Finnish, a low-resourced, nearly phonetic language, using approximately 60 hours of data. We conduct objective and subjective evaluations of our approach to compare its naturalness, speaker similarity, and editing effectiveness with TTS-based editing.

Title: Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis
Authors: Tarun G, Naman Malpani, Gugan Thoppe, Sridharan Devarajan
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied in automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering them computationally infeasible to analyze entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches to achieve reliable diagnoses. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.

Title: A Survey on Medical Image Compression: From Traditional to Learning-Based Approaches
Authors: Guofeng Tong, Sixuan Liu, Yang Lv, Hanyu Pei, Feng-Lei Fan
Abstract: The exponential growth of medical imaging has created significant challenges in data storage, transmission, and management for healthcare systems. In this vein, efficient compression becomes increasingly important. Unlike natural image compression, medical image compression prioritizes preserving diagnostic details and structural integrity, imposing stricter quality requirements and demanding fast, memory-efficient algorithms that balance computational complexity with clinically acceptable reconstruction quality. Meanwhile, the medical imaging family includes a plethora of modalities, each possessing different requirements. For example, 2D medical image (e.g., X-rays, histopathological images) compression focuses on exploiting intra-slice spatial redundancy, while volumetric medical image faces require handling intra-slice and inter-slice spatial correlations, and 4D dynamic imaging (e.g., time-series CT/MRI, 4D ultrasound) additionally demands processing temporal correlations between consecutive time frames. Traditional compression methods, grounded in mathematical transforms and information theory principles, provide solid theoretical foundations, predictable performance, and high standardization levels, with extensive validation in clinical environments. In contrast, deep learning-based approaches demonstrate remarkable adaptive learning capabilities and can capture complex statistical characteristics and semantic information within medical images. This comprehensive survey establishes a two-facet taxonomy based on data structure (2D vs 3D/4D) and technical approaches (traditional vs learning-based), thereby systematically presenting the complete technological evolution, analyzing the unique technical challenges, and prospecting future directions in medical image compression.

Title: Differentiable Grouped Feedback Delay Networks for Learning Coupled Volume Acoustics
Authors: Orchisama Das, Gloria Dal Santo, Sebastian J. Schlecht, Vesa Valimaki, Zoran Cvetkovic
Abstract: Rendering dynamic reverberation in a complicated acoustic space for moving sources and listeners is challenging but crucial for enhancing user immersion in extended-reality (XR) applications. Capturing spatially varying room impulse responses (RIRs) is costly and often impractical. Moreover, dynamic convolution with measured RIRs is computationally expensive with high memory demands, typically not available on wearable computing devices. Grouped Feedback Delay Networks (GFDNs), on the other hand, allow efficient rendering of coupled room acoustics. However, its parameters need to be tuned to match the reverberation profile of a coupled space. In this work, we propose the concept of Differentiable GFDNs (DiffGFDNs), which have tunable parameters that are optimised to match the late reverberation profile of a set of RIRs captured from a space that exhibits multi-slope decay. Once trained on a finite set of measurements, the DiffGFDN interpolates to unmeasured locations in the space. We propose a parallel processing pipeline that has multiple DiffGFDNs with frequency-independent parameters processing each octave band. The parameters of the DiffGFDN can be updated rapidly during inferencing as sources and listeners move. We evaluate the proposed architecture against the Common Slopes (CS) model on a dataset of RIRs for three coupled rooms. The proposed architecture generates multi-slope late reverberation with low memory and computational requirements, achieving a better energy decay relief (EDR) error and slightly worse octave-band energy decay curve (EDC) errors compared to the CS model. Furthermore, DiffGFDN requires an order of magnitude fewer floating-point operations per sample than the CS renderer.

Title: Non-Intrusive Automatic Speech Recognition Refinement: A Survey
Authors: Mohammad Reza Peyghan, Saman Soleimani Roudi, Saeedreza Zouashkiani, Sajjad Amini, Fatemeh Rajabi, Shahrokh Ghaemmaghami
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has become an integral component of modern technology, powering applications such as voice-activated assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools. Yet ASR systems continue to struggle with the inherent variability of human speech, such as accents, dialects, and speaking styles, as well as environmental interference, including background noise. Moreover, domain-specific conversations often employ specialized terminology, which can exacerbate transcription errors. These shortcomings not only degrade raw ASR accuracy but also propagate mistakes through subsequent natural language processing pipelines. Because redesigning an ASR model is costly and time-consuming, non-intrusive refinement techniques that leave the model's architecture unchanged have become increasingly popular. In this survey, we review current non-intrusive refinement approaches and group them into five classes: fusion, re-scoring, correction, distillation, and training adjustment. For each class, we outline the main methods, advantages, drawbacks, and ideal application scenarios. Beyond method classification, this work surveys adaptation techniques aimed at refining ASR in domain-specific contexts, reviews commonly used evaluation datasets along with their construction processes, and proposes a standardized set of metrics to facilitate fair comparisons. Finally, we identify open research gaps and suggest promising directions for future work. By providing this structured overview, we aim to equip researchers and practitioners with a clear foundation for developing more robust, accurate ASR refinement pipelines.

Title: Inference-Driven Uplink for 6G: Architecture, Principles, and Challenges
Authors: Chunmei Xu, Zhi Ding, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Peiying Zhu
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (6G) face a critical uplink challenge arising from stringent device-side resource constraints and the growing demand for intelligence services. This article introduces InferCom, an inference-driven communication architecture designed to enable robust 6G uplink transmission under low signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions. InferCom adopts a compute-asymmetric architecture, featuring a lightweight transmitter and an inference-capable receiver empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, together with a quality-of-experience (QoE)-aware retransmission mechanism. Grounded in the information bottleneck (IB) theory, InferCom redefines uplink communications through task-agnostic compression, inference-driven reconstruction, error-distribution channel coding, and QoE-aware feedback. The case study demonstrates that InferCom outperforms conventional 5G NR and Deep- JSCC in terms of transmitter-side computational complexity, required SNRs and retransmission efficiency. Finally, we outline key challenges and research directions toward making InferCom a practical enabler of human-centric, intelligent and sustainable wireless networks.

Title: Neural Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation
Authors: Muhammad Umer, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Ahsan Bilal, John M. Cioffi
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is a critical bottleneck in modern wireless networks, with pilot overhead consuming 11\% to 21\% of transmission bandwidth and feedback delays causing severe throughput degradation under mobility. Addressing this requires rethinking how neural fields represent coherent wave phenomena. This work introduces \textit{neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF)}, a physics-informed framework that fundamentally reframes neural field design by replacing view-dependent rasterization with direct complex-valued aggregation in 3D space. This approach natively models wave superposition rather than visual occlusion. The architectural shift transforms the learning objective from function-fitting to source-recovery, a well-posed inverse problem grounded in electromagnetic theory. While demonstrated for wireless channel estimation, the core principle of explicit primitive-based fields with physics-constrained aggregation extends naturally to any coherent wave-based domain, including acoustic propagation, seismic imaging, and ultrasound reconstruction. Evaluations show that the inductive bias of nGRF achieves 10.9 dB higher prediction SNR than state-of-the-art methods with 220$\times$ faster inference (1.1 ms vs. 242 ms), 18$\times$ lower measurement density, and 180$\times$ faster training. For large-scale outdoor environments where implicit methods fail, nGRF achieves 28.32 dB SNR, demonstrating that structured representations supplemented by domain physics can fundamentally outperform generic deep learning architectures.

Title: Predicting brain tumour enhancement from non-contrast MR imaging with artificial intelligence

Abstract: Brain tumour imaging assessment typically requires both pre- and post-contrast MRI, but gadolinium administration is not always desirable, such as in frequent follow-up, renal impairment, allergy, or paediatric patients. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of predicting brain tumour contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI sequences alone. We assembled 11089 brain MRI studies from 10 international datasets spanning adult and paediatric populations with various neuro-oncological states, including glioma, meningioma, metastases, and post-resection appearances. Deep learning models (nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing tumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images. Performance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level detection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were compared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected patients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5% sensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement volume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model outperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9% sensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3 (acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had Dice over 0.7 (excellent detection). Deep learning can identify contrast-enhancing brain tumours from non-contrast MRI with clinically relevant performance. These models show promise as screening tools and may reduce gadolinium dependence in neuro-oncology imaging. Future work should evaluate clinical utility alongside radiology experts.

Title: Learning Constraints from Stochastic Partially-Observed Closed-Loop Demonstrations
Authors: Chih-Yuan Chiu, Zhouyu Zhang, Glen Chou
Abstract: We present a method for learning unknown parametric constraints from locally-optimal input-output trajectory data. We assume the data is generated by rollouts of stochastic nonlinear dynamics, under a single state or output feedback law and initial condition but distinct noise realizations, to robustly satisfy underlying constraints despite worst-case noise outcomes. We encode the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of this robust optimal feedback control problem within a feasibility problem to recover constraints consistent with the local optimality of the demonstrations. We prove that our constraint learning method (i) accurately recovers the demonstrator's policy, and (ii) conservatively estimates the set of policies that ensure constraint satisfaction despite worst-case noise realizations. Moreover, we perform sensitivity analysis, proving that when demonstrations are corrupted by transmission error, the inaccuracy in the learned feedback law scales linearly in the error magnitude. Empirically, our method accurately recovers unknown constraints from simulated noisy, closed-loop demonstrations generated using dynamics, both linear and nonlinear, (e.g., unicycle and quadrotor) and a range of feedback mechanisms.

Title: Nord-Parl-TTS: Finnish and Swedish TTS Dataset from Parliament Speech
Authors: Zirui Li, Jens Edlund, Yicheng Gu, Nhan Phan, Lauri Juvela, Mikko Kurimo
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) development is limited by scarcity of high-quality, publicly available speech data for most languages outside a few high-resource languages. We present Nord-Parl-TTS, an open TTS dataset for Finnish and Swedish based on speech found in the wild. Using recordings of Nordic parliamentary proceedings, we extract 900 hours of Finnish and 5090 hours of Swedish speech suitable for TTS training. The dataset is built using an adapted version of the Emilia data processing pipeline and includes unified evaluation sets to support model development and benchmarking. By offering open, large-scale data for Finnish and Swedish, Nord-Parl-TTS narrows the resource gap in TTS between high- and lower-resourced languages.

Title: Measuring Audio's Impact on Correctness: Audio-Contribution-Aware Post-Training of Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Haolin He, Xingjian Du, Renhe Sun, Zheqi Dai, Yujia Xiao, Mingru Yang, Jiayi Zhou, Xiquan Li, Zhengxi Liu, Zining Liang, Chunyat Wu, Qianhua He, Tan Lee, Xie Chen, Wei-Long Zheng, Weiqiang Wang, Mark Plumbley, Jian Liu, Qiuqiang Kong
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) represent an important frontier in multimodal AI, addressing diverse audio tasks. Recently, post-training of LALMs has received increasing attention due to significant performance improvements over foundation models. While single-stage post-training such as reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results, multi-stage approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL remain suboptimal. The allocation of data across multiple training stages to maximize LALM capabilities has not been fully explored, and large-scale, high-quality datasets for such research are also lacking. To address these problems, we firstly present AudioMCQ, a comprehensive audio multiple-choice question dataset comprising 571k samples with two kinds of chain-of-thought annotations. Secondly, we investigate the prevalent zero audio-contribution phenomenon in LALMs, where models derive correct answers solely from textual information without processing audio content. We propose Audio-Contribution Filtering to partition data into weak and strong audio-contribution subsets. Based on these insights, we develop two effective post-training paradigms: Weak-to-Strong (SFT on weak audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data) and Mixed-to-Strong (SFT on mixed audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data). We achieve first place in the DCASE 2025 Audio-Question-Answering challenge by using AudioMCQ. Additionally, leveraging our dataset with different training strategies, we achieve 78.2\% on MMAU-test-mini, 75.6\% on MMAU, 67.1\% on MMAR, and 70.7\% on MMSU, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Probabilistic Control Barrier Functions: Safety in Probability for Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems
Authors: Pol Mestres, Blake Werner, Ryan K. Cosner, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities and the scenario approach, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.

Title: Memory-Augmented Generative AI for Real-time Wireless Prediction in Dynamic Industrial Environments
Authors: Rahul Gulia, Amlan Ganguly, Michael E. Kuhl, Ehsan Rashedi, Clark Hochgraf
Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.

Title: Decision-dependent Robust Charging Infrastructure Planning for Light-duty Truck Electrification at Industrial Sites
Authors: Yifu Ding, Ruicheng Ao, Pablo Duenas-Martinez, Thomas Magnanti
Abstract: Many industrial sites and digital logistics platforms rely on diesel-powered light-duty trucks to transport workers and small-scale facilities, which results in a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). To address this, we develop a robust model for planning charging infrastructure to electrify light-duty trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure selection (across multiple charger types and locations) and determines charging schedules for each truck based on the selected infrastructure. Given the strict stop times and schedules at industrial sites, we introduce a scheduling-with-abandonment problem in which trucks forgo charging if their waiting time exceeds a maximum threshold. We further incorporate the impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on drivers' waiting and abandonment behaviors. To model stochastic, heterogeneous parking durations, we classified trucks using machine learning (ML) methods based on contextual and time-location features. We then constructed decision-dependent, feature-driven robust uncertainty sets in which parking-time variability varies flexibly with drivers' charging choices. These feature-driven sets are applied to two robust optimization formulations with decision-dependent uncertainty (RO-DDU), resulting in distinct outcomes and managerial implications. We conduct a case study at an open-pit mining site to plan charger installations across eight charging zones, serving approximately 200 trucks. By decomposing the problem into a short rolling horizon or using a heuristic approach for the full-year or representative-day dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of less than 0.1\% under diverse uncertainty scenarios.

Title: Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Loads
Authors: Nan Gu, Junjie Qin
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.

Title: MARBLE-Net: Learning to Localize in Multipath Environment with Adaptive Rainbow Beams
Authors: Qiushi Liang, Yeyue Cai, Jianhua Mo, Meixia Tao
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand precise and efficient target localization, a task challenged by rich multipath propagation in complex wireless environments. This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\% in a multipath-rich scene. Moreover, the results reveal a nuanced interaction with multipath propagation: while confined uni-directional multipath degrades accuracy, structured and directional multipath can be effectively exploited to achieve performance surpassing even line-of-sight (LoS) conditions.

Title: A Design Framework that Unifies 6G Modulation Schemes for Double Selectivity
Authors: Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: There is significant recent interest in designing new modulation schemes for doubly-selective channels with large delay and Doppler spreads, where legacy modulation schemes based on time-frequency signal representations underperform. Multiple modulation schemes, e.g., in the delay-Doppler, chirp, time-sequency, and other domains, have been proposed in the literature for this purpose, with varying implementation details. In this letter, we establish that all previously proposed modulation schemes for doubly-selective signaling are instances of a single family of complex Hadamard-modulated pulse trains. When the delay and Doppler spread of the doubly-selective channel is limited to a certain support, all modulation schemes in this waveform family offer equivalent, full diversity achieving performance with no symbol fading and low channel estimation overhead. The existence of this waveform family also enables flexible, multi-waveform co-existence -- allowing a common transceiver architecture to generate multiple waveforms in the family, that may each be flexibly allocated to different users and services.

Title: Novel Stability Criteria for Discrete and Hybrid Systems via Ramanujan Inner Products
Authors: Shyam Kamal, Sunidhi Pandey, Thach Ngoc Dinh, Cao Thanh Tinh
Abstract: This paper introduces a Ramanujan inner product and its corresponding norm, establishing a novel framework for the stability analysis of hybrid and discrete-time systems as an alternative to traditional Euclidean metrics. We establish new $\epsilon$-$\delta$ stability conditions that utilize the unique properties of Ramanujan summations and their relationship with number-theoretic concepts. The proposed approach provides enhanced robustness guarantees and reveals fundamental connections between system stability and arithmetic properties of the system dynamics. Theoretical results are rigorously proven, and simulation results on numerical examples are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: Division-based Receiver-agnostic RFF Identification in WiFi Systems
Authors: Xuan Yang, Dongming Li, Dong Wei, Meng Zhang
Abstract: In physical-layer security schemes, radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification of WiFi devices is susceptible to receiver differences, which can significantly degrade classification performance when a model is trained on one receiver but tested on another. In this paper, we propose a division-based receiver-agnostic RFF extraction method for WiFi systems, which removes the receivers' effects by dividing different preambles in the frequency domain. The proposed method requires only a single receiver for training and does not rely on additional calibration or stacking processes. First, for flat fading channel scenarios, the legacy short training field (L-STF) and legacy long training field (L-LTF) of the unknown device are divided by those of the reference device in the frequency domain. The receiver-dependent effects can be eliminated with the requirement of only a single receiver for training, and the higher-dimensional RFF features can be extracted. Second, for frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, the high-throughput long training field (HT-LTF) is divided by the L-LTF in the frequency domain. Only a single receiver is required for training and the higher-dimensional RFF features that are both channel-invariant and receiver-agnostic are extracted. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigate the impacts of channel variations and receiver differences. The classification results show that, even when training on a single receiver and testing on a different one, the proposed method achieves classification accuracy improvements of 15.5% and 28.45% over the state-of-the-art approach in flat fading and frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, respectively.

Title: Rapid and Accurate Changepoint Detection of Power System Forced Oscillations
Authors: Luke Dosiek, Akaash Karn, Frank Liu
Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.

Title: Graph Signal Denoising Using Regularization by Denoising and Its Parameter Estimation
Authors: Hayate Kojima, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an interpretable denoising method for graph signals using regularization by denoising (RED). RED is a technique developed for image restoration that uses an efficient (and sometimes black-box) denoiser in the regularization term of the optimization problem. By using RED, optimization problems can be designed with the explicit use of the denoiser, and the gradient of the regularization term can be easily computed under mild conditions. We adapt RED for denoising of graph signals beyond image processing. We show that many graph signal denoisers, including graph neural networks, theoretically or practically satisfy the conditions for RED. We also study the effectiveness of RED from a graph filter perspective. Furthermore, we propose supervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods based on deep algorithm unrolling. These methods aim to enhance the algorithm applicability, particularly in the unsupervised setting. Denoising experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed method improves signal denoising accuracy in mean squared error compared to existing graph signal denoising methods.

Title: The Dawn of Agentic EDA: A Survey of Autonomous Digital Chip Design
Authors: Zelin Zang, Yuhang Song, Aili Wang, Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling, Qi Sun, Zhen Lei, Fuji Yang, Cheng Zhuo, Jiebo Luo
Abstract: The semiconductor industry faces a critical "Productivity Gap" where design complexity outpaces human capacity. While the "AI for EDA" revolution (L2) successfully optimized specific point problems, a paradigm shift toward Agentic EDA (L3) is emerging, evolving from passive prediction to autonomous orchestration of the RTL-to-GDSII flow. This survey presents the first systematic framework for this transition, framing Agentic EDA not merely as "Chat with Tools," but as a Constrained Neuro-Symbolic Optimization problem. We propose a novel taxonomy rooted in a Cognitive Stack--Perception (aligning multimodal semantics), Cognition (planning under strict constraints), and Action (deterministic tool execution)--to dissect how probabilistic agents navigate zero-tolerance physical laws. Through this lens, we analyze the landscape: (1) in Frontend, the shift from one-shot generation to dual-loop syntactic-semantic repair; (2) in Backend, the dichotomy between algorithm-centric solvers and agent-centric orchestrators that treat executable code as a latent space. Finally, we critically examine the Trustworthiness gap, advocating for Sim-to-Silicon benchmarks and formal grounding to transform brittle prototypes into resilient engineering systems.

Abstract: AV2 is the successor to the AV1 video coding standard developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). Its primary objective is to deliver substantial compression gains and subjective quality improvements while maintaining low-complexity encoder and decoder operations. This paper describes the transform, quantization and entropy coding design in AV2, including redesigned transform kernels and data-driven transforms, expanded transform partitioning, and a mode & coefficient dependent transform signaling. AV2 introduces several new coding tools including Intra/Inter Secondary Transforms (IST), Trellis Coded Quantization (TCQ), Adaptive Transform Coding (ATC), Probability Adaptation Rate Adjustment (PARA), Forward Skip Coding (FSC), Cross Chroma Component Transforms (CCTX), Parity Hiding (PH) tools and improved lossless coding. These advances enable AV2 to deliver the highest quality video experience for video applications at a significantly reduced bitrate.

Title: Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Hardware-Impaired Wireless Fronthaul
Authors: Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) enhances spectral and energy efficiency compared to conventional cellular networks by enabling joint transmission and reception across a large number of distributed access points (APs). Since these APs are envisioned to be low-cost and densely deployed, hardware impairments, stemming from non-ideal radio-frequency (RF) chains, are unavoidable. While existing studies primarily address hardware impairments on the access side, the impact of hardware impairments on the wireless fronthaul link has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we fill this important gap by introducing a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless fronthauling scheme tailored for cell-free massive MIMO. Focusing on the uplink, we develop an analytical framework that jointly models the hardware impairments at both the APs and the fronthaul transceivers, derives the resulting end-to-end distorted signal expression, and quantifies the individual contribution of each impairment to the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we design distortion-aware linear combiners that optimally mitigate these effects. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains from distortion-aware processing and illustrate the potential of the proposed AF fronthauling scheme as a cost-effective enabler for future cell-free architectures.

Title: Current and temperature imbalances in parallel-connected grid storage battery modules
Authors: Joseph Ross, Damien Frost, Efstratios Chatzinikolaou, Stephen Duncan, David Howey
Abstract: A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.

Title: W-DUALMINE: Reliability-Weighted Dual-Expert Fusion With Residual Correlation Preservation for Medical Image Fusion
Authors: Md. Jahidul Islam
Abstract: Medical image fusion integrates complementary information from multiple imaging modalities to improve clinical interpretation. However, existing deep learningbased methods, including recent spatial-frequency frameworks such as AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion, often suffer from a fundamental trade-off between global statistical similaritymeasured by correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI)and local structural fidelity. This paper proposes W-DUALMINE, a reliability-weighted dual-expert fusion framework designed to explicitly resolve this trade-off through architectural constraints and a theoretically grounded loss design. The proposed method introduces dense reliability maps for adaptive modality weighting, a dual-expert fusion strategy combining a global-context spatial expert and a wavelet-domain frequency expert, and a soft gradient-based arbitration mechanism. Furthermore, we employ a residual-to-average fusion paradigm that guarantees the preservation of global correlation while enhancing local details. Extensive experiments on CT-MRI, PET-MRI, and SPECT-MRI datasets demonstrate that W-DUALMINE consistently outperforms AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion in CC and MI metrics while

Title: Boundary adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction
Authors: Luigi Romano, Ole Morten Aamo, Miroslav Krstić, Jan Åslund, Erik Frisk
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction characteristics parameterized by a matrix of unknown coefficients appearing in the nonlinear (and possibly non-smooth) PDE source terms. Under appropriate assumptions of forward completeness and boundary sensing, an adaptive observer is synthesized to simultaneously estimate the lumped and distributed states, as well as the uncertain friction parameters, using only boundary measurements. The observer combines a finite-dimensional parameter estimator with an infinite-dimensional description of the state error dynamics, and achieves exponential convergence under persistent excitation. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated in simulation by considering a relevant example borrowed from road vehicle dynamics.

Title: Data-Driven Safe Output Regulation of Strict-Feedback Linear Systems with Input Delay
Authors: Zhenxu Zhao, Ji Wang, Weiyao Lan
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven safe control framework for linear systems possessing a known strict-feedback structure, but with most plant parameters, external disturbances, and input delay being unknown. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we utilize Krylov dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the system dynamics from measured data, enabling the reconstruction of the system and disturbance matrices. Concurrently, the batch least-squares identification (BaLSI) method is employed to identify other unknown parameters in the input channel. Using control barrier functions (CBFs) and backstepping, we first develop a full-state safe controller. Based on this, we build an output-feedback controller by performing system identification using only the output data and actuation signals as well as constructing an observer to estimate the unmeasured plant states. The proposed approach achieves: 1) finite-time identification of a substantial set of unknown system quantities, and 2) exponential convergence of the output state (the state furthest from the control input) to a reference trajectory while rigorously ensuring safety constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a safe vehicle platooning application.

Title: An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks
Authors: Tingwei Zhang, Jiahui Liu, David Allstot, Huaping Liu
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.

Title: Degradation-Aware Frequency Regulation of a Heterogeneous Battery Fleet via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Tanay Raghunandan Srinivasa, Vivek Deulkar, Jia Bhargava, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Prashant Shenoy
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation. Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction. To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Co-Design and Operation of Chiller and Thermal Energy Storage for Cost-Optimal HVAC Systems
Authors: Tanay Raghunandan Srinivasa, Vivek Deulkar, Aviruch Bhatia, Vishal Garg
Abstract: We study the joint operation and sizing of cooling infrastructure for commercial HVAC systems using reinforcement learning, with the objective of minimizing life-cycle cost over a 30-year horizon. The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.

Title: Silhouette Score Efficient Radio Frequency Fingerprint Feature Extraction
Authors: Xuan Yang, Dongming Li, Yi Lou, Xianglin Fan
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification technology, which exploits relatively stable hardware imperfections, is highly susceptible to constantly changing channel effects. Although various channel-robust RFF feature extraction methods have been proposed, they predominantly rely on experimental comparisons rather than theoretical analyses. This limitation hinders the progress of channel-robust RFF feature extraction and impedes the establishment of theoretical guidance for its design. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical performance analysis framework for different RFF feature extraction methods using the silhouette score as an evaluation metric, and propose a precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method that enhances the silhouette score without requiring channel estimation. First, we employ the silhouette score as an evaluation metric and obtain the theoretical performance of various RFF feature extraction methods using the Taylor series expansion. Next, we mitigate channel effects by computing the reciprocal of the received signal in the frequency domain at the device under authentication. We then compare these methods across three different scenarios: the deterministic channel scenario, the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic channel scenario, and the non-i.i.d. stochastic channel scenario. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the silhouette score is an efficient metric to evaluate classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method achieves the highest silhouette score and classification accuracy under channel variations.

Title: Impact of Physics-Informed Features on Neural Network Complexity for Li-ion Battery Voltage Prediction in Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircrafts
Authors: Eymen Ipek, Mario Hirz
Abstract: The electrification of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft demands high-fidelity battery management systems capable of predicting voltage response under aggressive power dynamics. While data-driven models offer high accuracy, they often require complex architectures and extensive training data. Conversely, equivalent circuit models (ECMs), such as the second-order model, offer physical interpretability but struggle with high C-rate non-linearities. This paper investigates the impact of integrating physics-based information into data-driven surrogate models. Specifically, we evaluate whether physics-informed features allow for the simplification of neural network architectures without compromising accuracy. Using the open-source electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) battery dataset, we compare pure data-driven models against physics-informed data models. Results demonstrate that physics-informed models achieve comparable accuracy to complex pure data-driven models while using up to 75% fewer trainable parameters, significantly reducing computational overhead for potential on-board deployment.

Title: Power Reserve Procurement Considering Dependent Random Variables with PCE
Authors: Nicola Ramseyer, Matthieu Jacobs, Mario Paolone
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for the modelling of dependent random variables using generalised polynomial chaos. This allows to write chance-constrained optimization problems with respect to a joint distribution modelling dependencies between different stochastic inputs. Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution. The paper exploits the problem structure and develops suitable transformations to ensure tractability. The proposed method is applied to a probabilistic power reserve procurement problem. The effectiveness of the method to capture dependencies is shown by comparing the approach with a standard approach considering independent random variables.

Title: Lyapunov Constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) using Koopman Operator Theory for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking
Authors: Dhruv S. Kushwaha, Zoleikha A. Biron
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has been significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm. GitHub Repository: this https URL

Title: Spatial Angular Pseudo-Derivative Searching: A Single Snapshot Super-resolution Sparse DOA Scheme with Potential for Practical Application
Authors: Longxin Bai, Jingchao Zhang, Liyan Qiao
Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution, and real-time DOA estimation is a cornerstone of environmental perception in automotive radar systems. While sparse signal recovery techniques offer super-resolution and high-precision estimation, their prohibitive computational complexity remains a primary bottleneck for practical deployment. This paper proposes a sparse DOA estimation scheme specifically tailored for the stringent requirements of automotive radar such as limited computational resources, restricted array apertures, and a single snapshot. By introducing the concept of the spatial angular pseudo-derivative and incorporating this property as a constraint into a standard L0-norm minimization problem, we formulate an objective function that more faithfully characterizes the physical properties of the DOA problem. The associated solver, designated as the SAPD search algorithm, naturally transforms the high-dimensional optimization task into an efficient grid-search scheme. The SAPD algorithm circumvents high-order matrix inversions and computationally intensive iterations. We provide an analysis of the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the SAPD method achieves a superior balance of real-time efficiency, high precision, and super-resolution, making it highly suitable for next-generation automotive radar applications.

Title: The Combination of Several Decorrelation Methods to Improve Acoustic Feedback Cancellation
Authors: Klaus Linhard, Philipp Bulling
Abstract: This paper extends an acoustic feedback cancellation system by incorporating multiple decorrelation methods. The baseline system is based on a frequency-domain Kalman filter implemented in a multi-delay structure. The proposed extensions include a variable time delay line, prediction, distortion compensation, and a simplified reverberation model. Each extension is analyzed, and a practical parameter range is defined. While existing literature often focuses on a single extension, such as prediction, to describe an optimal system, this work demonstrates that each individual extension contributes to performance improvements. Furthermore, the combination of all proposed extensions results in a superior system. The evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets, with performance assessed through system distance metrics and the objective speech quality measure PSEQ.

Title: Reproducible Benchmarking for Lung Nodule Detection and Malignancy Classification Across Multiple Low-Dose CT Datasets
Authors: Fakrul Islam Tushar, Avivah Wang, Lavsen Dahal, Ehsan Samei, Michael R. Harowicz, Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, Kyle J. Lafata, Tina D. Tailor, Cynthia Rudin, Joseph Y. Lo
Abstract: Evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) models for low-dose CT lung cancer screening is limited by heterogeneous datasets, annotation standards, and evaluation protocols, making performance difficult to compare and translate across clinical settings. We establish a public, reproducible multi-dataset benchmark for lung nodule detection and nodule-level cancer classification and quantify cross-dataset generalizability. Using the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) dataset as a clinically curated development set, we evaluate performance across LUNA16/LIDC-IDRI, NLST-3D, and LUNA25. Detection models trained on DLCS and LUNA16 were evaluated externally on NLST-3D using free-response ROC analysis. For malignancy classification, we compared five strategies: randomly initialized ResNet50, Models Genesis, Med3D, a Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers, and a Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) approach pretrained using detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Performance was summarized using AUC with 95% confidence intervals and DeLong tests. Detection performance varied substantially by training dataset, with DLCS-trained models outperforming LUNA16-trained models on external NLST-3D evaluation (sensitivity at 2 false positives per scan: 0.72 vs. 0.64; p < 0.001). For malignancy classification, ResNet50-SWS achieved AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS), 0.90 (LUNA16), 0.81 (NLST-3D), and 0.80 (LUNA25), consistently matching or exceeding alternative pretraining strategies. These results demonstrate that dataset characteristics strongly influence lung cancer AI performance and highlight the need for transparent, multi-dataset benchmarking.

Title: SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions
Authors: Songqiao Hu, Zidong Wang, Zeyi Liu, Zhen Shen, Xiao He
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on explicit analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Under the constructed CBF, theoretical guarantees are established regarding system safety and the Lipschitz continuity of the control inputs. Furthermore, incremental update theorems are provided, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving computational speeds significantly faster than baseline methods while ensuring the system safely reaches its target position.

Title: Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees
Authors: Sourav Ganguly, Kishan Panaganti, Arnob Ghosh, Adam Wierman
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.

Title: Infinity Search: Approximate Vector Search with Projections on q-Metric Spaces
Authors: Antonio Pariente, Ignacio Hounie, Santiago Segarra, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: An ultrametric space or infinity-metric space is defined by a dissimilarity function that satisfies a strong triangle inequality in which every side of a triangle is not larger than the larger of the other two. We show that search in ultrametric spaces with a vantage point tree has worst-case complexity equal to the depth of the tree. Since datasets of interest are not ultrametric in general, we employ a projection operator that transforms an arbitrary dissimilarity function into an ultrametric space while preserving nearest neighbors. We further learn an approximation of this projection operator to efficiently compute ultrametric distances between query points and points in the dataset. We proceed to solve a more general problem in which we consider projections in $q$-metric spaces -- in which triangle sides raised to the power of $q$ are smaller than the sum of the $q$-powers of the other two. Notice that the use of learned approximations of projected $q$-metric distances renders the search pipeline approximate. We show in experiments that increasing values of $q$ result in faster search but lower recall. Overall, search in q-metric and infinity metric spaces is competitive with existing search methods.

Title: Training-Free Inference for High-Resolution Sinogram Completion
Authors: Jiaze E, Srutarshi Banerjee, Tekin Bicer, Guannan Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Bin Ren
Abstract: High-resolution sinogram completion is critical for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing projections can introduce severe artifacts. While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for this task, their inference cost grows prohibitively with resolution. We propose HRSino, a training-free and efficient diffusion inference approach for high-resolution sinogram completion. By explicitly accounting for spatial heterogeneity in signal characteristics, such as spectral sparsity and local complexity, HRSino allocates inference effort adaptively across spatial regions and resolutions, rather than applying uniform high-resolution diffusion steps. This enables global consistency to be captured at coarse scales while refining local details only where necessary. Experimental results show that HRSino reduces peak memory usage by up to 30.81% and inference time by up to 17.58% compared to the state-of-the-art framework, and maintains completion accuracy across datasets and resolutions.

Title: A Saddle Point Algorithm for Robust Data-Driven Factor Model Problems
Authors: Shabnam Khodakaramzadeh, Soroosh Shafiee, Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: We study the factor model problem, which aims to uncover low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional datasets. Adopting a robust data-driven approach, we formulate the problem as a saddle-point optimization. Our primary contribution is a first-order algorithm that solves this reformulation by leveraging a linear minimization oracle (LMO). We further develop semi-closed form solutions (up to a scalar) for three specific LMOs, corresponding to the Frobenius norm, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Gelbrich (aka Wasserstein) distance. The analysis includes explicit quantification of these LMOs' regularity conditions, notably the Lipschitz constants of the dual function, which govern the algorithm's convergence performance. Numerical experiments confirm our method's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings, outperforming standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.

Title: Human-Like Trajectories Generation via Receding Horizon Tracking Applied to the TickTacking Interface
Authors: Daniele Masti, Stefano Menchetti, Çağrı Erdem, Giorgio Gnecco, Davide Rocchesso
Abstract: TickTacking is a rhythm-based interface that allows users to control a pointer in a two-dimensional space through dual-button tapping. This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration

Title: STITCH: Simultaneous Thinking and Talking with Chunked Reasoning for Spoken Language Models
Authors: Cheng-Han Chiang, Xiaofei Wang, Linjie Li, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Shujie Liu, Zhendong Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Hung-yi Lee, Lijuan Wang
Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and demonstrations are on the project page: this https URL.

Title: Graphon Mean-Field Logit Dynamic: Derivation, Computation, and Applications
Authors: H. Yoshioka
Abstract: We present a graphon mean-field logit dynamic, a stationary mean-field game based on logit interactions. This dynamic emerges from a stochastic control problem involving a continuum of nonexchangeable and interacting agents and reduces to solving a continuum of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations connected through a graphon that models the connections among agents. Using a fixed-point argument, we prove that this HJB system admits a unique solution in the space of bounded functions when the discount rate is high (i.e., agents are myopic). Under certain assumptions, we also establish regularity properties of the system, such as equi-continuity. We propose a finite difference scheme for computing the HJB system and prove the uniqueness and existence of its numerical solutions. The mean-field logit dynamic is applied to a case study on inland fisheries resource management in the upper Tedori River of Japan. A series of computational cases are then conducted to investigate the dependence of the dynamic on both the discount rate and graphon.

Title: Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models
Authors: Xavier Gonzalez, Leo Kozachkov, David M. Zoltowski, Kenneth L. Clarkson, Scott W. Linderman
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.

Title: Collaborative-Online-Learning-Enabled Distributionally Robust Motion Control for Multi-Robot Systems
Authors: Chao Ning, Han Wang, Longyan Li, Yang Shi
Abstract: This paper develops a novel COllaborative-Online-Learning (COOL)-enabled motion control framework for multi-robot systems to avoid collision amid randomly moving obstacles whose motion distributions are partially observable through decentralized data streams. To address the notable challenge of data acquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution information by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By leveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a data-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then introduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits the derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire prediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity set for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its safety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the ambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure space, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and computation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are generated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The distributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed ambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes through tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the probabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking performance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions
Authors: Zhouyu Zhang, Chih-Yuan Chiu, Glen Chou
Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the local Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods accurately inferred constraints and designed safe interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.

Title: Fed-PISA: Federated Voice Cloning via Personalized Identity-Style Adaptation
Authors: Qi Wang, Shituo Ma, Guoxin Yu, Hanyang Peng, Yue Yu
Abstract: Voice cloning for Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to generate expressive and personalized speech from text using limited data from a target speaker. Federated Learning (FL) offers a collaborative and privacy-preserving framework for this task, but existing approaches suffer from high communication costs and tend to suppress stylistic heterogeneity, resulting in insufficient personalization. To address these issues, we propose Fed-PISA, which stands for Federated Personalized Identity-Style Adaptation. To minimize communication costs, Fed-PISA introduces a disentangled Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanism: the speaker's timbre is retained locally through a private ID-LoRA, while only a lightweight style-LoRA is transmitted to the server, thereby minimizing parameter exchange. To harness heterogeneity, our aggregation method, inspired by collaborative filtering, is introduced to create custom models for each client by learning from stylistically similar peers. Experiments show that Fed-PISA improves style expressivity, naturalness, and speaker similarity, outperforming standard federated baselines with minimal communication costs.

Title: CoBEVMoE: Heterogeneity-aware Feature Fusion with Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Collaborative Perception
Authors: Lingzhao Kong, Jiacheng Lin, Siyu Li, Kai Luo, Zhiyong Li, Kailun Yang
Abstract: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@0.5 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception.

Title: Transformer-based Learning-to-Optimize Approach for Scalable and Generalizable Beamforming
Authors: Yubo Zhang, Xiao-Yang Liu, Xiaodong Wang
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm, a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and online learning approaches.

Title: Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat
Authors: Viviana Centritto, Ama Bandara, Heqi Deng, Masoud Babaie, Evgenii Vinogradov, Sergi Abadal, Eduard Alarcon
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.

Title: MTR-DuplexBench: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Round Conversations for Full-Duplex Speech Language Models
Authors: He Zhang, Wenqian Cui, Haoning Xu, Xiaohui Li, Lei Zhu, Haoli Bai, Shaohua Ma, Irwin King
Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. Also, existing benchmarks often focus solely on evaluating conversational features, neglecting other critical aspects. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark designed for a comprehensive multi-round evaluation of FD-SLMs. MTR-DuplexBench not only segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns for turn-by-turn assessment but also incorporates various evaluation aspects, including conversational features, dialogue quality, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Title: SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Obstacle-free Trajectory Planning for UAVs in an Unknown Dynamic Environment
Authors: Astik Srivastava, Thomas J Chackenkulam, Bitla Bhanu Teja, Antony Thomas, Madhava Krishna
Abstract: We address the problem of reactive motion planning for quadrotors operating in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.

Title: Improving 2D Diffusion Models for 3D Medical Imaging with Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity
Authors: Chenhe Du, Qing Wu, Xuanyu Tian, Jingyi Yu, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang
Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.
