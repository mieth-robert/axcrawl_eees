Title: Experience Paper: Scaling WiFi Sensing to Millions of Commodity Devices for Ubiquitous Home Monitoring
Authors: Guozhen Zhu, Yuqian Hu, Chenshu Wu, Wei-Hsiang Wang, Beibei Wang, K. J. Ray Liu
Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi sensing in real-world environments.

Title: Phi-Omni-ST: A multimodal language model for direct speech-to-speech translation
Authors: Yuxuan Hu, Haibin Wu, Ruchao Fan, Xiaofei Wang, Heng Lu, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li
Abstract: Speech-aware language models (LMs) have demonstrated capabilities in understanding spoken language while generating text-based responses. However, enabling them to produce speech output efficiently and effectively remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Phi-Omni-ST, a multimodal LM for direct speech-to-speech translation (ST), built on the open-source Phi-4 MM model. Phi-Omni-ST extends its predecessor by generating translated speech using an audio transformer head that predicts audio tokens with a delay relative to text tokens, followed by a streaming vocoder for waveform synthesis. Our experimental results on the CVSS-C dataset demonstrate Phi-Omni-ST's superior performance, significantly surpassing existing baseline models trained on the same dataset. Furthermore, when we scale up the training data and the model size, Phi-Omni-ST reaches on-par performance with the current SOTA model.

Title: Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?
Authors: Ariadna Sanchez, Simon King
Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model, with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the voice reconstruction task.

Title: Laterally Excited Bulk Acoustic Wave (LBAW) X-Cut Lithium Niobate Resonators
Authors: Walter Gubinelli, Ryan Tetro, Pietro Simeoni, Luca Colombo, Matteo Rinaldi
Abstract: In this work, Laterally excited Bulk Acoustic Wave (LBAW) resonators on X-cut Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) and, for the first time their higher-order overtones (LOBAW) are demonstrated by embedding interdigitated electrodes recessed into the piezoelectric thin film, allowing to exploit both S0 and SH0 vibrational modes. This recessed electrode architecture decouples the dispersion relation from film thickness, enabling lithographic tuning of resonance frequency and on-chip multi-frequency scaling on a single substrate, while concurrently increasing static capacitance density (C0) and reducing ohmic losses (Rs). The excited SH0 modes exhibits Figures of Merit (FoM) of 437 at 673 MHz for the fundamental tone and 53 at 1.05 GHz for the overtone. The proposed architecture holds large potential for future 5G/6G advanced radio frequency front-end modules, enabling on-chip multi-frequency scaling and improved performance.

Title: Gradient Inversion Attacks on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
Authors: Hasin Us Sami, Swapneel Sen, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy, Basak Guler
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications. Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while opening up several future directions. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: A Poisson-Guided Decomposition Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement
Authors: Isha Rao, Sanjay Ghosh
Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.

Title: Bringing Interpretability to Neural Audio Codecs
Authors: Samir Sadok, Julien Hauret, Éric Bavu
Abstract: The advent of neural audio codecs has increased in popularity due to their potential for efficiently modeling audio with transformers. Such advanced codecs represent audio from a highly continuous waveform to low-sampled discrete units. In contrast to semantic units, acoustic units may lack interpretability because their training objectives primarily focus on reconstruction performance. This paper proposes a two-step approach to explore the encoding of speech information within the codec tokens. The primary goal of the analysis stage is to gain deeper insight into how speech attributes such as content, identity, and pitch are encoded. The synthesis stage then trains an AnCoGen network for post-hoc explanation of codecs to extract speech attributes from the respective tokens directly.

Title: French Listening Tests for the Assessment of Intelligibility, Quality, and Identity of Body-Conducted Speech Enhancement
Authors: Thomas Joubaud, Julien Hauret, Véronique Zimpfer, Éric Bavu
Abstract: This study evaluates the Extreme Bandwidth Extension Network (EBEN) model on body-conduction sensors through listening tests. Using the Vibravox dataset, we assess intelligibility with a French Modified Rhyme Test, speech quality with a MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor) protocol and speaker identity preservation with an A/B identification task. The experiments involved male and female speakers recorded with a forehead accelerometer, rigid in-ear and throat microphones. The results confirm that EBEN enhances both speech quality and intelligibility. It slightly degrades speaker identification performance when applied to female speakers' throat microphone recordings. The findings also demonstrate a correlation between Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) and perceived quality in body-conducted speech, while speaker verification using ECAPA2-TDNN aligns well with identification performance. No tested metric reliably predicts EBEN's effect on intelligibility.

Title: Towards Efficient Speech-Text Jointly Decoding within One Speech Language Model
Authors: Haibin Wu, Yuxuan Hu, Ruchao Fan, Xiaofei Wang, Kenichi Kumatani, Bo Ren, Jianwei Yu, Heng Lu, Lijuan Wang, Yao Qian, Jinyu Li
Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Title: DAS-MAE: A self-supervised pre-training framework for universal and high-performance representation learning of distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing
Authors: Junyi Duan, Jiageng Chen, Zuyuan He
Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a transformative approach for distributed vibration measurement with high spatial resolution and long measurement range while maintaining cost-efficiency. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal DAS signals present analytical challenges. The abstract signal morphology lacking intuitive physical correspondence complicates human interpretation, and its unique spatial-temporal coupling renders conventional image processing methods suboptimal. This study investigates spatial-temporal characteristics and proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns signals' representations through a mask-reconstruction task. This framework is named the DAS Masked AutoEncoder (DAS-MAE). The DAS-MAE learns high-level representations (e.g., event class) without using labels. It achieves up to 1% error and 64.5% relative improvement (RI) over the semi-supervised baseline in few-shot classification tasks. In a practical external damage prevention application, DAS-MAE attains a 5.0% recognition error, marking a 75.7% RI over supervised training from scratch. These results demonstrate the high-performance and universal representations learned by the DAS-MAE framework, highlighting its potential as a foundation model for analyzing massive unlabeled DAS signals.

Title: EMO-Debias: Benchmarking Gender Debiasing Techniques in Multi-Label Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Yu-Hsuan Li Liang, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However, the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing, regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

Title: Spectral Efficiency Maximization for mmWave MIMO-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Practical Constraints
Authors: Jitendra Singh, Anand Mehrotra, Suraj Srivastava, Aditya K. Jagannatham, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: A hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) and receive combiner (RC) pair is conceived for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The proposed design considers a practical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the achieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To achieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs), while satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit power, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the hybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex and intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are designed first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and constant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a majorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a predefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are adopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference (MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a linear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the knowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user fairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the geometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison to the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under consideration.

Title: Design of OTFS Signals with Pulse Shaping and Window Function for OTFS-Based Radar
Authors: Liangchen Sun, Yutaka Jitsumatsu
Abstract: We propose a pulse radar system that employs a generalized window function derived from the root raised cosine (RRC), which relaxes the conventional constraint that the window values are within the range [0, 1]. The proposed window allows both negative values and values exceeding 1, enabling greater flexibility in signal design. The system transmits orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signals intermittently, establishing a flexible input-output relationship that captures both fractional delays and Doppler shifts. By combining the generalized RRC window with a rectangular pulse, the resulting pilot signal achieves a sharp concentration in the ambiguity function over both the delay and Doppler domains. To enhance the estimation accuracy of fractional parameters, we apply frequency-domain interpolation based on the autocorrelation of the RRC window, which outperforms conventional linear interpolation by preserving the signal structure more effectively.

Title: Multivariate Probabilistic Assessment of Speech Quality
Authors: Fredrik Cumlin, Xinyu Liang, Victor Ungureanu, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Christian Schüldt, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: The mean opinion score (MOS) is a standard metric for assessing speech quality, but its singular focus fails to identify specific distortions when low scores are observed. The NISQA dataset addresses this limitation by providing ratings across four additional dimensions: noisiness, coloration, discontinuity, and loudness, alongside MOS. In this paper, we extend the explored univariate MOS estimation to a multivariate framework by modeling these dimensions jointly using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Our approach utilizes Cholesky decomposition to predict covariances without imposing restrictive assumptions and extends probabilistic affine transformations to a multivariate context. Experimental results show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art methods in point estimation, while uniquely providing uncertainty and correlation estimates across speech quality dimensions. This enables better diagnosis of poor speech quality and informs targeted improvements.

Title: Distribution System State and Impedance Estimation Augmented with Carson's Equations
Authors: Marta Vanin, Frederik Geth, Rahmat Heidari, Dirk Van Hertem
Abstract: The impedances of cables and lines used in (multi-conductor) distribution networks are usually unknown or approximated, and may lead to problematic results for any physics-based power system calculation, e.g., (optimal) power flow. Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.

Title: En Route Path-planning for Partially Occupied Vehicles in Ride-pooling Systems
Authors: Pengbo Zhu, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate, Nikolas Geroliminis
Abstract: Ride-pooling services, such as UberPool and Lyft Shared Saver, enable a single vehicle to serve multiple customers within one shared trip. Efficient path-planning algorithms are crucial for improving the performance of such systems. For partially occupied vehicles with available capacity, we introduce a novel routing algorithm designed to maximize the likelihood of picking up additional passengers while serving the current passengers to their destination. Unlike traditional methods that group passengers and vehicles based on predefined time windows, our algorithm allows for immediate responses to passenger requests. Our approach optimizes travel time while dynamically considering passenger demand and coordinating with other vehicles. Formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, our method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance service quality.

Title: DACN: Dual-Attention Convolutional Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Usman Muhammad, Jorma Laaksonen
Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution. Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Title: Massive MIMO with 1-Bit DACs: Data Detection for Quantized Linear Precoding with Dithering
Authors: Amin Radbord, Italo Atzeni, Antti Tölli
Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft estimation.

Title: Cloud-Based Interoperability in Residential Energy Systems
Authors: Darren Leniston, David Ryan, Ammar Malik, Jack Jackman, Terence O'Donnell
Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV, batteries and electric vehicles become increasingly prevalent at the edge, maintaining grid stability requires advanced monitoring and control mechanisms. This paper presents a scalable smart grid gateway architecture that enables interoperability between Modbus-based inverters and IEEE 2030.5 cloud-based control systems. The proposed solution leverages Azure cloud services and edge-computing gateway devices to support dynamic configuration, telemetry ingestion, remote control and Volt-VAR Curve deployment. A microservice-based architecture ensures flexibility and scalability across diverse deployment scenarios, including both gateway-mediated and direct-to-cloud device communication. Results demonstrate the successful mapping of a Fronius Primo inverter's Modbus registers to IEEE 2030.5-compliant telemetry and control functions. Additionally, we evaluate real-time VVC updates and their impact on local voltage regulation, showcasing dynamic cloud-to-edge control with minimal latency. This work highlights the potential of virtualised, standards-based control infrastructures to support DER integration and active grid participation, while remaining adaptable to evolving smart grid architectures.

Title: Pinching Antenna Systems versus Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in mmWave
Authors: Mostafa Samy, Hayder Al-Hraishawi, Madyan Alsenwi, Abuzar B. M. Adam, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Otteresten
Abstract: Flexible and intelligent antenna designs, such as pinching antenna systems and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), have gained extensive research attention due to their potential to enhance the wireless channels. This letter, for the first time, presents a comparative study between the emerging pinching antenna systems and RIS in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our results reveal that RIS requires an extremely large number of elements (in the order of $10^4$) to outperform pinching antenna systems in terms of spectral efficiency, which severely impact the energy efficiency performance of RIS. Moreover, pinching antenna systems demonstrate greater robustness against hardware impairments and severe path loss typically encountered in high-frequency mmWave bands.

Title: An SCMA Receiver for 6G NTN based on Multi-Task Learning
Authors: Bruno De Filippo, Carla Amatetti, Riccardo Campana, Alessandro Guidotti, Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli
Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to enhance the user experience in a multitude of different ways. The unification of existing terrestrial networks with non-terrestrial network (NTN) components will provide users with ubiquitous connectivity. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) will enable low-latency services, with computations performed closer to the end users, and distributed learning paradigms. Advanced multiple access schemes, such as sparse code multiple access (SCMA), can be employed to efficiently move data from edge nodes to spaceborne MEC servers. However, the non-orthogonal nature of SCMA results in interference, limiting the effectiveness of traditional SCMA receivers. Hence, NTN links should be protected with robust channel codes, significantly reducing the uplink throughput. Thus, we investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to SCMA receivers for 6G NTNs. We train an AI model with multi-task learning to optimally separate and receive superimposed SCMA signals. Through link level simulations, we evaluate the block error rate (BLER) and the aggregated theoretical throughput achieved by the AI model as a function of the received energy per bit over noise power spectral density ratio (Eb/N0). We show that the proposed receiver achieves a target 10% BLER with 3.5dB lower Eb/N0 with respect to the benchmark algorithm. We conclude the assessment discussing the complexity-related challenges to the implementation of the AI model on board of a low earth orbit satellite.

Title: PixCell: A generative foundation model for digital histopathology images
Authors: Srikar Yellapragada, Alexandros Graikos, Zilinghan Li, Kostas Triaridis, Varun Belagali, Saarthak Kapse, Tarak Nath Nandi, Ravi K Madduri, Prateek Prasanna, Tahsin Kurc, Rajarsi R. Gupta, Joel Saltz, Dimitris Samaras
Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Title: Noise-Driven AI Sensors: Secure Healthcare Monitoring with PUFs
Authors: Christiana Chamon, Abhijit Sarkar, A. Lynn Abbott
Abstract: Wearable and implantable healthcare sensors are pivotal for real-time patient monitoring but face critical challenges in power efficiency, data security, and signal noise. This paper introduces a novel platform that leverages hardware noise as a dual-purpose resource to enhance machine learning (ML) robustness and secure data via Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By integrating noise-driven signal processing, PUFbased authentication, and ML-based anomaly detection, our system achieves secure, low-power monitoring for devices like ECG wearables. Simulations demonstrate that noise improves ML accuracy by 8% (92% for detecting premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and atrial fibrillation (AF)), while PUFs provide 98% uniqueness for tamper-resistant security, all within a 50 uW power budget. This unified approach not only addresses power, security, and noise challenges but also enables scalable, intelligent sensing for telemedicine and IoT applications.

Title: Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems
Authors: Linxuan He, Qing-Shan Jia, Ang Li, Hongyan Sang, Ling Wang, Jiwen Lu, Tao Zhang, Jie Zhou, Yi Zhang, Yisen Wang, Peng Wei, Zhongyuan Wang, Henry X. Liu, Shuo Feng
Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance, leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.

Title: Joint Beamforming and Integer User Association using a GNN with Gumbel-Softmax Reparameterizations
Authors: Qing Lyu, Mai Vu
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can effectively optimize a multi-cell wireless network by designing the beamforming vectors and association decisions. Existing ML designs, however, often needs to approximate the integer association variables with a probability distribution output. We propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) structure that jointly optimize beamforming vectors and user association while guaranteeing association output as integers. The integer association constraints are satisfied using the Gumbel-Softmax (GS) reparameterization, without increasing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed GS-based GNN consistently achieves integer association decisions and yields a higher sum-rate, especially when generalized to larger networks, compared to all other fractional association methods.

Title: DM-SegNet: Dual-Mamba Architecture for 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Global Context Modeling
Authors: Hangyu Ji
Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling, existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.

Title: Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR
Authors: Zheng-Xin Yong, Vineel Pratap, Michael Auli, Jean Maillard
Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers (which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for new languages.

Title: Polarized 6D Movable Antenna for Wireless Communication: Channel Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Xiaodan Shao, Qijun Jiang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Naofal Al-Dhahir
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarized six-dimensional movable antenna (P-6DMA) to enhance the performance of wireless communication cost-effectively. Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First, we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI. Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming, antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.

Title: Grapheme-Coherent Phonemic and Prosodic Annotation of Speech by Implicit and Explicit Grapheme Conditioning
Authors: Hien Ohnaka, Yuma Shirahata, Byeongseon Park, Ryuichi Yamamoto
Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2) Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels, and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the estimation accuracy.

Title: Olfactory Inertial Odometry: Sensor Calibration and Drift Compensation
Authors: Kordel K. France, Ovidiu Daescu, Anirban Paul, Shalini Prasad
Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types. Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Title: LESS: Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-Supervised Learning for Speech Foundational Models
Authors: Wen Ding, Fan Qian
Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework, pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency. Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Title: Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight Architecture DDPM
Authors: Xun Li, Qiong Wu
Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

Title: Intelligent Channel Allocation for IEEE 802.11be Multi-Link Operation: When MAB Meets LLM
Authors: Shumin Lian, Jingwen Tong, Jun Zhang, Liqun Fu
Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$ in dense networks.

Title: MARS: Radio Map Super-resolution and Reconstruction Method under Sparse Channel Measurements
Authors: Chuyun Deng, Na Liu, Wei Xie, Lianming Xu, Li Wang
Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Title: Real-Time LPV-Based Non-Linear Model Predictive Control for Robust Trajectory Tracking in Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Nitish Kumar, Rajalakshmi Pachamuthu
Abstract: This paper presents the development and implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for trajectory tracking in autonomous vehicles under diverse driving conditions. The proposed approach incorporates a modular architecture that integrates state estimation, vehicle dynamics modeling, and optimization to ensure real-time performance. The state-space equations are formulated in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form, and a curvature-based tuning method is introduced to optimize weight matrices for varying trajectories. The MPC framework is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) for parallel execution of state estimation and control optimization, ensuring scalability and minimal latency. Extensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted on multiple predefined trajectories, demonstrating high accuracy with minimal cross-track and orientation errors, even under aggressive maneuvers and high-speed conditions. The results highlight the robustness and adaptability of the proposed system, achieving seamless alignment between simulated and real-world performance. This work lays the foundation for dynamic weight tuning and integration into cooperative autonomous navigation systems, paving the way for enhanced safety and efficiency in autonomous driving applications.

Title: An Array Decomposition Method for Finite Arrays with Electrically Connected Elements for fast Toeplitz Solvers
Authors: Lucas Åkerstedt, Harald Hultin, B. L. G. Jonsson
Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method, applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32 array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.

Title: LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme for phoneme-based speech recognition
Authors: Te Ma, Min Bi, Saierdaer Yusuyin, Hao Huang, Zhijian Ou
Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However, Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs). Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9% respectively.

Title: IIITH-BUT system for IWSLT 2025 low-resource Bhojpuri to Hindi speech translation
Authors: Bhavana Akkiraju, Aishwarya Pothula, Santosh Kesiraju, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation quality in terms of BLEU.

Title: Synchro-Thermography: Monitoring ~10 mK Facial Temperature Changes with Heartbeat Referencing for Physiological Sensing
Authors: Nanami Kotani, Kuniharu Sakurada, Jiayi Xu, Masahiko Inami, Yasuaki Monnai
Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity. Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.

Title: Physics Informed Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Underwater Image Enhancement
Authors: Niki Martinel, Rita Pucci
Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning. Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets. Code and data \textit{will} be available at this https URL.

Title: Bilevel Optimization for Improved Flexibility Aggregation Models of Electric Vehicle Fleets
Authors: Philipp Härtel, Michael von Bonin
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are expected to become an increasingly important source of flexibility for power system operations. However, accurately capturing the flexibility potential of numerous and heterogeneous EVs remains a significant challenge. We propose a bilevel optimization formulation to enhance flexibility aggregations of electric vehicle fleets. The outer level minimizes scheduling deviations between the aggregated and reference EV units, while the inner level maximizes the aggregated unit's profits. Our approach introduces hourly to daily scaling factor mappings to parameterize the aggregated EV units. Compared to simple aggregation methods, the proposed framework reduces the root-mean-square error of charging power by 78~per cent, providing more accurate flexibility representations. The proposed framework also provides a foundation for several potential extensions in future work.

Title: Improving AI-generated music with user-guided training
Authors: Vishwa Mohan Singh, Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula, Ahan Chatterjee, Beste Aydemir, Rifat Mehreen Amin
Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide. In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Abstract: We consider the problem of robust diffusive stability (RDS) for a pair of Schur-stable nonnegative matrices. Specifically, we show that the existence of a common diagonal Lyapunov function is sufficient for RDS and highlight how this condition differs from recently published results based on linear copositive Lyapunov functions. We also present two results on RDS for extended Leslie matrices arising in population dynamics.

Title: Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications
Authors: Ioana Hustiu, Roozbeh Abolpour, Cristian Mahulea, Marius Kloetzer
Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.

Title: Energy-Optimized Scheduling for AIoT Workloads Using TOPSIS
Authors: Preethika Pradeep, Eyhab Al-Masri
Abstract: AIoT workloads demand energy-efficient orchestration across cloud-edge infrastructures, but Kubernetes' default scheduler lacks multi-criteria optimization for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents GreenPod, a TOPSIS-based scheduler optimizing pod placement based on execution time, energy consumption, processing core, memory availability, and resource balance. Tested on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster, GreenPod improves energy efficiency by up to 39.1% over the default Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler, particularly with energy-centric weighting schemes. Medium complexity workloads showed the highest energy savings, despite slight scheduling latency. GreenPod effectively balances sustainability and performance for AIoT applications.

Title: A Practitioner's Guide to Building ASR Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Scottish Gaelic
Authors: Ondřej Klejch, William Lamb, Peter Bell
Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when the language in question was not present in the original training data. The fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better performance with limited training data. This combination allows better utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Title: Energentic Intelligence: From Self-Sustaining Systems to Enduring Artificial Life
Authors: Atahan Karagoz
Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision. Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Title: Goal-Oriented Semantic Resource Allocation with Cumulative Prospect Theoretic Agents
Authors: Symeon Vaidanis, Photios A. Stavrou, Marios Kountouris
Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective (e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory (EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics. By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.

Title: Optimization for Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation under CPT-based Utilities
Authors: Symeon Vaidanis, Photios A. Stavrou, Marios Kountouris
Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here. By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.

Title: Indoor Sharing in the Mid-Band: A Performance Study of Neutral-Host, Cellular Macro, and Wi-Fi
Authors: Joshua Roy Palathinkal, Muhammad Iqbal Rochman, Vanlin Sathya, Mehmet Yavuz, Monisha Ghosh
Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs), suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand, may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models, particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private 4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6 GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6 network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices (CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink (UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv) the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL performance by 5.05x.

Title: Agentic AI for Intent-Based Industrial Automation
Authors: Marcos Lima Romero, Ricardo Suyama
Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities, enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm, originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction (HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable, and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing, the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets, context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

Title: Better Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-domain ASR Through Incremental Retraining and Data Filtering
Authors: Andres Carofilis, Pradeep Rangappa, Srikanth Madikeri, Shashi Kumar, Sergio Burdisso, Jeena Prakash, Esau Villatoro-Tello, Petr Motlicek, Bidisha Sharma, Kadri Hacioglu, Shankar Venkatesan, Saurabh Vyas, Andreas Stolcke
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4% over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower computational cost.

Title: The NTNU System at the S&I Challenge 2025 SLA Open Track
Authors: Hong-Yun Lin, Tien-Hong Lo, Yu-Hsuan Fang, Jhen-Ke Lin, Chung-Chun Wang, Hao-Chien Lu, Berlin Chen
Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4 multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked, and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Title: AudioLens: A Closer Look at Auditory Attribute Perception of Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: Chih-Kai Yang, Neo Ho, Yi-Jyun Lee, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs) is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for future improvements.

Title: Through-the-Wall Radar Human Activity Recognition WITHOUT Using Neural Networks
Authors: Weicheng Gao
Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at: this https URL.

Title: CSI2Vec: Towards a Universal CSI Feature Representation for Positioning and Channel Charting
Authors: Victoria Palhares, Sueda Taner, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing semantic and syntactic relationships of text through vector embeddings. Inspired by this technique, we propose CSI2Vec, a self-supervised framework for generating universal and robust channel state information (CSI) representations tailored to CSI-based positioning (POS) and channel charting (CC). CSI2Vec learns compact vector embeddings across various wireless scenarios, capturing spatial relationships between user equipment positions without relying on CSI reconstruction or ground-truth position information. We implement CSI2Vec as a neural network that is trained across various deployment setups (i.e., the spatial arrangement of radio equipment and scatterers) and radio setups (RSs) (i.e., the specific hardware used), ensuring robustness to aspects such as differences in the environment, the number of used antennas, or allocated set of subcarriers. CSI2Vec abstracts the RS by generating compact vector embeddings that capture essential spatial information, avoiding the need for full CSI transmission or reconstruction while also reducing complexity and improving processing efficiency of downstream tasks. Simulations with ray-tracing and real-world CSI datasets demonstrate CSI2Vec's effectiveness in maintaining excellent POS and CC performance while reducing computational demands and storage.

Title: Sensitivity-Informed Parameter Selection for Improved Soil Moisture Estimation from Remote Sensing Data
Authors: Bernard T. Agyeman, Erfan Orouskhani, Mohamed Naouri, Willemijn Appels, Maik Wolleben, Jinfeng Liu (University of Alberta), Sirish L. Shah
Abstract: Improving the accuracy of soil moisture estimation is required for advancing irrigation scheduling and water conservation efforts. Central to this task are soil hydraulic parameters, which govern moisture dynamics but are rarely known precisely and must therefore be inferred from observational data. In large-scale agricultural fields, estimating the complete set of these parameters is often impractical due to the sparse and noisy nature of available measurements. To address this challenge, this work develops a framework that uses sensitivity analysis and orthogonal projection to identify parameters that are both reliably estimable from available data. These parameters, together with the spatial distribution of soil moisture, are jointly estimated by assimilating observational data into a cylindrical-coordinate version of the Richards equation using an extended Kalman filter. The soil moisture measurements are obtained from microwave remote sensors mounted on center pivot irrigation systems - an emerging and practical technology for capturing field-scale variability. Numerical simulations and field experiments conducted on a large-scale site in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, demonstrate that the proposed method improves soil moisture estimation accuracy by 24-43% and enhances predictive model performance by 50%. Furthermore, the estimated parameters - particularly saturated hydraulic conductivity - exhibit good agreement with experimental measurements.

Abstract: Seaweed biomass presents a substantial opportunity for climate mitigation, yet to realize its potential, farming must be expanded to the vast open oceans. However, in the open ocean neither anchored farming nor floating farms with powerful engines are economically viable. Thus, a potential solution are farms that operate by going with the flow, utilizing minimal propulsion to strategically leverage beneficial ocean currents. In this work, we focus on low-power autonomous seaweed farms and design controllers that maximize seaweed growth by taking advantage of ocean currents. We first introduce a Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation to solve for the growth-optimal value function when the true currents are known. However, in reality only short-term imperfect forecasts with increasing uncertainty are available. Hence, we present three additional extensions. Firstly, we use frequent replanning to mitigate forecast errors. Second, to optimize for long-term growth, we extend the value function beyond the forecast horizon by estimating the expected future growth based on seasonal average currents. Lastly, we introduce a discounted finite-time DP formulation to account for the increasing uncertainty in future ocean current estimates. We empirically evaluate our approach with 30-day simulations of farms in realistic ocean conditions. Our method achieves 95.8\% of the best possible growth using only 5-day this http URL demonstrates that low-power propulsion is a promising method to operate autonomous seaweed farms in real-world conditions.

Title: Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning for Biosignal Applications -- A Review
Authors: Ivo Pascal de Jong, Andreea Ioana Sburlea, Matias Valdenegro-Toro
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has gained traction in an attempt to improve the interpretability and robustness of machine learning predictions. Specifically (medical) biosignals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrooculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG) could benefit from good UQ, since these suffer from a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and good human interpretability is pivotal for medical applications. In this paper, we review the state of the art of applying Uncertainty Quantification to Machine Learning tasks in the biosignal domain. We present various methods, shortcomings, uncertainty measures and theoretical frameworks that currently exist in this application domain. We address misconceptions in the field, provide recommendations for future work, and discuss gaps in the literature in relation to diagnostic implementations as well as control for prostheses or brain-computer interfaces. Overall it can be concluded that promising UQ methods are available, but that research is needed on how people and systems may interact with an uncertainty-model in a (clinical) environment

Title: Sample-based nonlinear detectability for discrete-time systems
Authors: Isabelle Krauss, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: This paper introduces two sample-based formulations of incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), a suitable detectability notion for general nonlinear systems. In this work we consider the case of limited output information, i.e., measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. The output-dependent term of the sample-based i-IOSS bound is properly modified to yield a characterization for detectability in presence of incomplete output sequences. We provide both a non-timediscounted and a time-discounted formulation of samplebased i-IOSS. Furthermore, conditions for an i-IOSS system to be also sample-based i-IOSS are given and the relation between the two formulations of sample-based i-IOSS is shown.

Title: A Comparative Study of Conventional and Tripolar EEG for High-Performance Reach-to-Grasp BCI Systems
Authors: Ali Rabiee, Sima Ghafoori, Anna Cetera, Walter Besio, Reza Abiri
Abstract: This study aims to enhance BCI applications for individuals with motor impairments by comparing the effectiveness of tripolar EEG (tEEG) with conventional EEG. The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.

Title: Eddeep: Fast eddy-current distortion correction for diffusion MRI with deep learning
Authors: Antoine Legouhy, Ross Callaghan, Whitney Stee, Philippe Peigneux, Hojjat Azadbakht, Hui Zhang
Abstract: Modern diffusion MRI sequences commonly acquire a large number of volumes with diffusion sensitization gradients of differing strengths or directions. Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.

Title: Predictive control for nonlinear stochastic systems: Closed-loop guarantees with unbounded noise
Authors: Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: We present a stochastic model predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state to minimize a deterministic quadratic cost and satisfy tightened constraints. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear continuously differentiable systems using stochastic contraction metrics and an assumed bound on the covariance matrices. Numerical simulations highlight the computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees of the proposed method. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control with closed-loop guarantees for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.

Title: Event-triggered moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems
Authors: Isabelle Krauss, Julian D. Schiller, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: This work proposes an event-triggered moving horizon estimation (ET-MHE) scheme for general nonlinear systems. The key components of the proposed scheme are a novel event-triggering mechanism (ETM) and the suitable design of the MHE cost function. The main characteristic of our method is that the MHE's nonlinear optimization problem is only solved when the ETM triggers the transmission of measured data to the remote state estimator. If no event occurs, then the current state estimate results from an open-loop prediction using the system dynamics. Furthermore, we show robust global exponential stability of the ET-MHE under a suitable detectability condition. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed method in terms of a nonlinear benchmark example, where we achieved similar estimation performance compared to standard MHE using 86% less computational resources.

Title: Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization
Authors: Nikhil Raghav, Avisek Gupta, Md Sahidullah, Swagatam Das
Abstract: Spectral clustering has proven effective in grouping speech representations for speaker diarization tasks, although post-processing the affinity matrix remains difficult due to the need for careful tuning before constructing the Laplacian. In this study, we present a novel pruning algorithm to create a sparse affinity matrix called spectral clustering on p-neighborhood retained affinity matrix (SC-pNA). Our method improves on node-specific fixed neighbor selection by allowing a variable number of neighbors, eliminating the need for external tuning data as the pruning parameters are derived directly from the affinity matrix. SC-pNA does so by identifying two clusters in every row of the initial affinity matrix, and retains only the top p % similarity scores from the cluster containing larger similarities. Spectral clustering is performed subsequently, with the number of clusters determined as the maximum eigengap. Experimental results on the challenging DIHARD-III dataset highlight the superiority of SC-pNA, which is also computationally more efficient than existing auto-tuning approaches. Our implementations are available at this https URL.

Title: DRIFTS: Optimizing Domain Randomization with Synthetic Data and Weight Interpolation for Fetal Brain Tissue Segmentation
Authors: Vladyslav Zalevskyi, Thomas Sanchez, Margaux Roulet, Hélène Lajous, Jordina Aviles Verdera, Roxane Licandro, Georg Langs, Gregor Kasprian, Jana Hutter, Hamza Kebiri, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Fetal brain tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool that supports understanding of neurodevelopment, yet it faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data coming from different scanners and settings, as well as data scarcity. Recent approaches based on domain randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown great potential for single-source domain generalization by simulating images with randomized contrast and image resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSegbased methods in fetal brain MRI. Specifically, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture models employed in FetalSynthSeg outperform physics-informed generation methods in terms of OOD generalization. We further show that incorporating intensity clustering significantly enhances generalization in settings with limited label classes by producing more realistic synthetic data. By combining synthetic pretraining with fine-tuning on real images and applying weight-space interpolation between the two models, we propose DRIFTS as an effective and practical solution for single-source domain generalization. DRIFTS consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks and is, to our knowledge, the first method to achieve accurate brain tissue segmentation on fetal T1-weighted images. We validate our approach on 308 subjects from four datasets acquired at three different sites, covering a range of scanner field strengths (0.55T to 3T) and both T1w and T2w modalities. We conclude with five practical recommendations to guide the development of SynthSeg-based methods for other organs and imaging modalities.

Title: FlowDAS: A Stochastic Interpolant-based Framework for Data Assimilation
Authors: Siyi Chen, Yixuan Jia, Qing Qu, He Sun, Jeffrey A Fessler
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) integrates observations with a dynamical model to estimate states of PDE-governed systems. Model-driven methods (e.g., Kalman, particle) presuppose full knowledge of the true dynamics, which is not always satisfied in practice, while purely data-driven solvers learn a deterministic mapping between observations and states and therefore miss the intrinsic stochasticity of real processes. Recently, score-based diffusion models learn a global diffusion prior and provide a good modeling of the stochastic dynamics, showing new potential for DA. However, their all-at-once generation rather than step-by-step transition limits their performance when dealing with highly complex stochastic processes and lacks physical interpretability. To tackle these drawbacks, we introduce FlowDAS, a generative DA framework that uses stochastic interpolants to directly learn state transition dynamics and achieve step-by-step transition to better model the real dynamics. We also improve the framework by combining the observation, better suiting the DA settings. Directly learning the underlying dynamics from collected data removes restrictive dynamical assumptions, and conditioning on observations at each interpolation step yields stable, measurement-consistent forecasts. Experiments on Lorenz-63, Navier-Stokes super-resolution/sparse-observation scenarios, and large-scale weather forecasting -- where dynamics are partly or wholly unknown -- show that FlowDAS surpasses model-driven methods, neural operators, and score-based baselines in accuracy and physical plausibility.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Communication System Based on Radio Frequency Resonance Beam
Authors: Yixuan Guo, Shuaifan Xia, Mingliang Xiong, Qingwen Liu, Wen Fang, Qingwei Jiang, Gang Yan, Jiangchuan Mu
Abstract: To address the complex beam control in traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, researchers have proposed adaptive beam alignment using retro-directive antenna (RDA) arrays. This approach creates echo resonance between the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), significantly reducing computational load. However, conventional resonant beam systems (RBS) suffer from echo interference due to the shared uplink and downlink frequency. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative resonance beam-based integrated sensing and communication (RB-ISAC) system designed for efficient passive sensing and bidirectional communication. In this system, the UE operates passively, with both the BS and UE utilizing a phase conjugation and frequency conversion structure to decouple uplink and downlink carrier frequencies, ensuring continuous electromagnetic wave oscillation between the two ends. Effective compensation for signal propagation loss enables resonance after multiple oscillations. At this point, the beam's field forms a low-diffraction-loss, highly focused pattern, automatically aligning the transmitter and receiver. This enables high-precision passive positioning alongside robust uplink and downlink communication. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system achieves resonance within multiple iterations, supporting uplink and downlink communication up to 5 m, and enabling passive direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with an error under 2$^\circ$ .

Title: Fault-Tolerant Control for System Availability and Continuous Operation in Heavy-Duty Wheeled Mobile Robots
Authors: Mehdi Heydari Shahna, Pauli Mustalahti, Jouni Mattila
Abstract: When the control system in a heavy-duty wheeled mobile robot (HD-WMR) malfunctions, deviations from ideal motion occur, significantly heightening the risks of off-road instability and costly damage. To meet the demands for safety, reliability, and controllability in HD-WMRs, the control system must tolerate faults to a certain extent, ensuring continuous operation. To this end, this paper introduces a model-free hierarchical control with fault accommodation (MFHCA) framework designed to address sensor and actuator faults in hydraulically powered HD-WMRs with independently controlled wheels. To begin, a novel mathematical representation of the motion dynamics of HD-WMRs, incorporating both sensor and actuator fault modes, is investigated. Subsequently, the MFHCA framework is proposed to manage all wheels under various fault modes, ensuring that each wheel tracks the reference driving velocities and steering angles, which are inverse kinematically mapped from the angular and linear velocities commanded in the HD-WMR's base frame. To do so, this framework generates appropriate power efforts in independently valve-regulated wheels to accommodate the adaptively isolated faults, thereby ensuring exponential stability. The experimental analysis of a 6,500-kg hydraulic-powered HD-WMR under various fault modes and rough terrains demonstrates the validity of the MFHCA framework.

Title: Alpha-Beta HMM: Hidden Markov Model Filtering with Equal Exit Probabilities and a Step-Size Parameter
Authors: Dongyan Sui, Haotian Pu, Siyang Leng, Stefan Vlaski
Abstract: The hidden Markov model (HMM) provides a powerful framework for inference in time-varying environments, where the underlying state evolves according to a Markov chain. To address the optimal filtering problem in general dynamic settings, we propose the $\alpha\beta$-HMM algorithm, which simplifies the state transition model to a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities and introduces a step-size parameter to balance the influence of observational data and the model. By analyzing the algorithm's dynamics in stationary environments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off between inference accuracy and adaptation capability, highlighting how key parameters and observation quality impact performance. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamical system governing the evolution of the log-belief ratio, along with supporting numerical experiments, demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptability and inference performance in dynamic environments.

Title: Evaluation of LLMs in Speech is Often Flawed: Test Set Contamination in Large Language Models for Speech Recognition
Authors: Yuan Tseng, Titouan Parcollet, Rogier van Dalen, Shucong Zhang, Sourav Bhattacharya
Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure contamination impact, LLMs trained with/without contamination are compared. A contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Then, speech recognisers based on LLMs are compared. They show only subtle error rate differences if the LLM is contaminated, but assign significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during LLM training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

Title: A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems
Authors: Luiza Ribeiro, Alexandre Street, Jose Manuel Arroyo, Rodrigo Moreno
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.

Title: Contrast-Invariant Self-supervised Segmentation for Quantitative Placental MRI
Authors: Xinliu Zhong, Ruiying Liu, Emily S. Nichols, Xuzhe Zhang, Andrew F. Laine, Emma G. Duerden, Yun Wang
Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i) masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation.

Title: Inter-Speaker Relative Cues for Text-Guided Target Speech Extraction
Authors: Wang Dai, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: We propose a novel approach that utilizes inter-speaker relative cues for distinguishing target speakers and extracting their voices from mixtures. Continuous cues (e.g., temporal order, age, pitch level) are grouped by relative differences, while discrete cues (e.g., language, gender, emotion) retain their categories. Relative cues offers greater flexibility than fixed speech attribute classification, facilitating much easier expansion of text-guided target speech extraction datasets. Our experiments show that combining all relative cues yields better performance than random subsets, with gender and temporal order being the most robust across languages and reverberant conditions. Additional cues like pitch level, loudness, distance, speaking duration, language, and pitch range also demonstrate notable benefit in complex scenarios. Fine-tuning pre-trained WavLM Base+ CNN encoders improves overall performance over the baseline of using only a Conv1d encoder.

Title: Optimizing Software Defined Battery Systems for Transformer Protection
Authors: Sonia Martin, Obidike Nnorom Jr., Philip Levis, Ram Rajagopal
Abstract: Residential electric vehicle charging causes large spikes in electricity demand that risk violating neighborhood transformer power limits. Battery energy storage systems reduce these transformer limit violations, but operating them individually is not cost-optimal. Instead of individual optimization, aggregating, or sharing, these batteries leads to cost-optimal performance, but homeowners must relinquish battery control. This paper leverages virtualization to propose battery sharing optimization schemes to reduce electricity costs, extend the lifetime of a residential transformer, and maintain homeowner control over the battery. A case study with simulated home loads, solar generation, and electric vehicle charging profiles demonstrates that joint, or shared, optimization reduces consumer bills by 56% and transformer aging by 48% compared to individual optimization. Hybrid and dynamic optimization schemes that provide owners with autonomy have similar transformer aging reduction but are slightly less cost-effective. These results suggest that controlling shared batteries with virtualization is an effective way to delay transformer upgrades in the face of growing residential electric vehicle charging penetration.

Title: Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units
Authors: Juntian Tu, Sarthak Subhankar
Abstract: Real-time arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications. This paper introduces a novel AWG architecture using an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones. This AWG architecture is designed for creating large defect-free optical tweezer arrays of single neutral atoms or molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation.

Title: Bias Assessment and Data Drift Detection in Medical Image Analysis: A Survey
Authors: Mischa Dombrowski, Andrea Prenner, Bernhard Kainz
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models have gained popularity in medical imaging analysis given their expert level performance in many medical domains. To enhance the trustworthiness, acceptance, and regulatory compliance of medical imaging models and to facilitate their integration into clinical settings, we review and categorise methods for ensuring ML reliability, both during development and throughout the model's lifespan. Specifically, we provide an overview of methods assessing models' inner-workings regarding bias encoding and detection of data drift for disease classification models. Additionally, to evaluate the severity in case of a significant drift, we provide an overview of the methods developed for classifier accuracy estimation in case of no access to ground truth labels. This should enable practitioners to implement methods ensuring reliable ML deployment and consistent prediction performance over time.

Title: LEDRO: LLM-Enhanced Design Space Reduction and Optimization for Analog Circuits
Authors: Dimple Vijay Kochar, Hanrui Wang, Anantha Chandrakasan, Xin Zhang
Abstract: Traditional approaches for designing analog circuits are time-consuming and require significant human expertise. Existing automation efforts using methods like Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are sub-optimal and costly to generalize across different topologies and technology nodes. In our work, we introduce a novel approach, LEDRO, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with optimization techniques to iteratively refine the design space for analog circuit sizing. LEDRO is highly generalizable compared to other RL and BO baselines, eliminating the need for design annotation or model training for different topologies or technology nodes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed framework and baseline on 22 different Op-Amp topologies across four FinFET technology nodes. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEDRO as it outperforms our best baseline by an average of 13% FoM improvement with 2.15x speed-up on low complexity Op-Amps and 48% FoM improvement with 1.7x speed-up on high complexity Op-Amps. This highlights LEDRO's effective performance, efficiency, and generalizability.

Title: Learning Two-agent Motion Planning Strategies from Generalized Nash Equilibrium for Model Predictive Control
Authors: Hansung Kim, Edward L. Zhu, Chang Seok Lim, Francesco Borrelli
Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.

Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal this http URL the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals.

Title: Uncovering Memorization Effect in the Presence of Spurious Correlations
Authors: Chenyu You, Haocheng Dai, Yifei Min, Jasjeet S. Sekhon, Sarang Joshi, James S. Duncan
Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on atypical examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we hypothesize that spurious memorization, concentrated within a small subset of neurons, plays a key role in driving imbalanced group performance. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.

Title: An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors

Abstract: Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at this https URL. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at this https URL. The entire design is an open source project and was developed using free software.

Title: Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery: An RL-based Generative Approach
Authors: Haohan Zou, Jie Feng, Hao Zhao, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Despite advances in learning-based methods, finding valid Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging. Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.

Title: MMS-LLaMA: Efficient LLM-based Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with Minimal Multimodal Speech Tokens
Authors: Jeong Hun Yeo, Hyeongseop Rha, Se Jin Park, Yong Man Ro
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) achieves robust speech recognition in noisy environments by combining auditory and visual information. However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by 86% compared to the previous multimodal speech LLM framework, but also improves computational efficiency by reducing FLOPs by 35.7%.

Title: Hearing Anywhere in Any Environment
Authors: Xiulong Liu, Anurag Kumar, Paul Calamia, Sebastia V. Amengual, Calvin Murdock, Ishwarya Ananthabhotla, Philip Robinson, Eli Shlizerman, Vamsi Krishna Ithapu, Ruohan Gao
Abstract: In mixed reality applications, a realistic acoustic experience in spatial environments is as crucial as the visual experience for achieving true immersion. Despite recent advances in neural approaches for Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, most existing methods are limited to the single environment on which they are trained, lacking the ability to generalize to new rooms with different geometries and surface materials. We aim to develop a unified model capable of reconstructing the spatial acoustic experience of any environment with minimum additional measurements. To this end, we present xRIR, a framework for cross-room RIR prediction. The core of our generalizable approach lies in combining a geometric feature extractor, which captures spatial context from panorama depth images, with a RIR encoder that extracts detailed acoustic features from only a few reference RIR samples. To evaluate our method, we introduce ACOUSTICROOMS, a new dataset featuring high-fidelity simulation of over 300,000 RIRs from 260 rooms. Experiments show that our method strongly outperforms a series of baselines. Furthermore, we successfully perform sim-to-real transfer by evaluating our model on four real-world environments, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and the realism of our dataset.

Title: Can Masked Autoencoders Also Listen to Birds?
Authors: Lukas Rauch, René Heinrich, Ilyass Moummad, Alexis Joly, Bernhard Sick, Christoph Scholz
Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have shown competitive results in audio classification by learning rich semantic representations through an efficient self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, thereby revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAE models. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap requires more than domain-specific pretraining data; adapting the entire training pipeline is crucial. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37%$_\text{p}$ in MAP and narrow the gap to fine-tuning to approximately 3.3%$_\text{p}$ on average across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.

Title: MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation
Authors: Woohyun Cho, Youngmin Kim, Sunghyun Lee, Youngjae Yu
Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.

Title: STOPA: A Database of Systematic VariaTion Of DeePfake Audio for Open-Set Source Tracing and Attribution
Authors: Anton Firc, Manasi Chibber, Jagabandhu Mishra, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Tomi Kinnunen, Kamil Malinka
Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing - determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model transparency.

Title: FGAS: Fixed Decoder Network-Based Audio Steganography with Adversarial Perturbation Generation
Authors: Jialin Yan, Yu Cheng, Zhaoxia Yin, Xinpeng Zhang, Shilin Wang, Tanfeng Sun, Xinghao Jiang
Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has made high-fidelity generated audio widely available across the Internet, providing diverse cover signals for covert communication. Driven by advances in deep learning, current audio steganography schemes are mainly based on encoding-decoding network architectures. While these methods greatly improve the security of audio steganography, they typically require complex training and large pre-trained models. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper pioneers a Fixed Decoder Network-Based Audio Steganography with Adversarial Perturbation Generation (FGAS). Adversarial perturbations carrying secret message are embedded into the cover audio to generate stego audio. The receiver only needs to share the structure and weights of the fixed decoder network to accurately extract the secret message from the stego audio, this eliminates the reliance on large pre-trained models. In FGAS, we propose an audio Adversarial Perturbation Generation (APG) strategy and design a lightweight fixed decoder. The fixed decoder guarantees reliable extraction of the hidden message, while the adversarial perturbations are optimized to keep the stego audio perceptually and statistically close to the cover audio, thereby improving resistance to steganalysis. The experimental results show that FGAS significantly improves the quality of stego audio, achieving an average PSNR gain of over 10 dB compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, FGAS exhibits superior anti-steganalysis performance under different relative payloads; under high-capacity embedding, it achieves a classification error rate about 2% higher, indicating stronger anti-steganalysis performance compared to current SOTA methods.

Title: Fewer Hallucinations, More Verification: A Three-Stage LLM-Based Framework for ASR Error Correction
Authors: Yangui Fang, Baixu Cheng, Jing Peng, Xu Li, Yu Xi, Chengwei Zhang, Guohui Zhong
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3) reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Title: NTPP: Generative Speech Language Modeling for Dual-Channel Spoken Dialogue via Next-Token-Pair Prediction
Authors: Qichao Wang, Ziqiao Meng, Wenqian Cui, Yifei Zhang, Pengcheng Wu, Bingzhe Wu, Irwin King, Liang Chen, Peilin Zhao
Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

Title: ADEPT: Adaptive Diffusion Environment for Policy Transfer Sim-to-Real
Authors: Youwei Yu, Junhong Xu, Lantao Liu
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured environments. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable environments to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of outdoor environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce ADEPT, a novel \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{T}ransfer in the zero-shot sim-to-real fashion that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex environments adaptive to the current policy. ADEPT guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted environments from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADEPT seamlessly transitions between generating similar environments for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. To benchmark ADEPT in off-road navigation, we propose a fast and effective multi-layer map representation for wild environment generation. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADEPT outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.

Title: Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion-Based Priors: An Approximation-Free Ensemble Sampling Approach
Authors: Haoxuan Chen, Yinuo Ren, Martin Renqiang Min, Lexing Ying, Zachary Izzo
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However, current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based methods.
