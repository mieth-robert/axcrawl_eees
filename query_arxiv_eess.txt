Title: Observer-Free Sliding Mode Control via Structured Decomposition: a Smooth and Bounded Control Framework
Authors: Jaafar Gaber
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an observer-free sliding mode control (SMC) method based on explicit structural compensation via the decomposition \( s = \alpha - \beta \). The proposed formulation eliminates the need for state observers and higher-order derivatives, reduces chattering, and yields smooth, bounded control signal. Simulation results confirms its robustness and stability on benchmark nonlinear systems (pendulum, Van der Pol, Duffing, and networked systems) under noise, disturbances, and parameter variations. A Lyapunov-based stability proof confirms convergence. This method provides a scalable and practical alternative to traditional SMC, well suited for embedded and distributed environments.

Title: Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization for Neural Compression
Authors: Xiaoxu Zhu
Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals, severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ, achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1 reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior quantization method for neural compression.

Title: Turbo Spin Echo Imaging at 7T with Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions Method for Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and Proton Density Contrasts
Authors: Celik Boga, Anke Henning
Abstract: Purpose: Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions (BOGA) method, which was initially implemented for T_2^* contrast via gradient echo acquisitions, is adapted for TSE imaging at 7T using parallel transmission (pTx) system for obtaining homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images. Theory and Methods: Multiple TSE images with complimentary RF modes and scan parameters are acquired as input images for the BOGA method where RF modes have complimentary transmit and receive field inhomogeneity patterns and scan parameters have varying echo and repetition times. With the application of the BOGA method using different subsets of the data acquisitions for each contrast, homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrast in the final images obtained. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effect of the TSE factor, two TSE factors are used individually. Normalized intensity profiles and signal to noise ratio maps are utilized for the comparison of the CP mode images and the TSE factors respectively. Results: Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images are obtained with the TSE implementation of the BOGA method without the transmit and receive field inhomogeneity effects. Furthermore, mixed contrast effects of the TSE acquisition are simultaneously resolved independently of the TSE factor. Conclusion: TSE application of BOGA method results in homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrasts at 7T, as the inhomogeneity effects are removed from the final contrast without any prior data acquisitions.

Title: Konzepte zur Effizienzsteigerung von Traktionsmotoren in batterieelektrischen Fahrzeugen durch den Einsatz neuartiger teillastoptimierbarer Motor- und Invertertopologien
Authors: Christoph Sachs, Martin Neuburger
Abstract: To increase the efficiency of future electric vehicles, it is crucial to reduce drivetrain losses in battery-powered vehicles. This enables either an increase in driving range or overall cost savings by reducing battery capacity while maintaining the same range. Harmonic motor losses account for an avoidable share of more than 30% of the total eDrive losses in standard B6-2L 300 kW iPMSM configurations. These losses result from high-frequency voltage distortion across the motor windings, which can be reduced through various approaches. Of great importance is the classification of cost-neutral and low-cost concepts for loss reduction. The following presents and categorizes approaches to loss reduction that have been developed by research and industry in recent years. In particular, novel part-load-capable motor and inverter concepts are introduced, which enable motor switching or multilevel operation to reduce harmonic losses in the part-load range.

Title: Beyond Imaging: Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogates for 3D+T Biological Tissue Dynamics
Authors: Kaan Berke Ugurlar, Joaquín de Navascués, Michael Taynnan Barros
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

Title: Structure-Preserving Medical Image Generation from a Latent Graph Representation
Authors: Kevin Arias, Edwin Vargas, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Antonio Ortega, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Supervised learning techniques have proven their efficacy in many applications with abundant data. However, applying these methods to medical imaging is challenging due to the scarcity of data, given the high acquisition costs and intricate data characteristics of those images, thereby limiting the full potential of deep neural networks. To address the lack of data, augmentation techniques leverage geometry, color, and the synthesis ability of generative models (GMs). Despite previous efforts, gaps in the generation process limit the impact of data augmentation to improve understanding of medical images, e.g., the highly structured nature of some domains, such as X-ray images, is ignored. Current GMs rely solely on the network's capacity to blindly synthesize augmentations that preserve semantic relationships of chest X-ray images, such as anatomical restrictions, representative structures, or structural similarities consistent across datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel GM that leverages the structural resemblance of medical images by learning a latent graph representation (LGR). We design an end-to-end model to learn (i) a LGR that captures the intrinsic structure of X-ray images and (ii) a graph convolutional network (GCN) that reconstructs the X-ray image from the LGR. We employ adversarial training to guide the generator and discriminator models in learning the distribution of the learned LGR. Using the learned GCN, our approach generates structure-preserving synthetic images by mapping generated LGRs to X-ray. Additionally, we evaluate the learned graph representation for other tasks, such as X-ray image classification and segmentation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, increasing performance up to $3\%$ and $2\%$ for classification and segmentation, respectively.

Title: Solving Three-phase AC Infeasibility Analysis to Near-zero Optimality Gap
Authors: Bikram Panthee, Amritanshu Pandey
Abstract: Recent works have shown the use of equivalent circuit-based infeasibility analysis to identify weak locations in distribution power grids. For three-phase power flow problems, when the power flow solver diverges, three-phase infeasibility analysis (TPIA) can converge and identify weak locations. The original TPIA problem is non-convex, and local minima and saddle points are possible. This can result in grid upgrades that are sub-optimal. To address this issue, we reformulate the original non-convex nonlinear program (NLP) as an exact non-convex bilinear program (BLP). Subsequently, we apply the spatial branch-and-bound (SBnB) algorithm to compute a solution with near-zero optimality gap. To improve SBnB performance, we introduce a bound tightening algorithm with variable filtering and decomposition, which tightens bounds on bilinear variables. We demonstrate that sequential bound tightening (SBT) significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of Gurobi's SBnB algorithm. Our results show that the proposed method can solve large-scale three-phase infeasibility analysis problems with >5k nodes, achieving an optimality gap of less than 10e-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing the developed presolve routine for bounding, we can reduce the runtime of SBnB by up to 97%.

Title: Dynamic Switching Models for Truck-only Delivery and Drone-assisted Truck Delivery under Demand Uncertainty
Authors: Jiaqing Lu, Qianwen Guo, Dian Sheng, Shumin Chen, Paul Schonfeld
Abstract: Integrating drones into truck delivery systems can improve customer accessibility, reduce operational costs, and increase delivery efficiency. However, drone deployment incurs costs, including procurement, maintenance, and energy consumption, and its benefits depend on service demand. In low-demand areas, drone-assisted trucks may underutilize resources due to high upfront costs. Accurately predicting demand is challenging due to uncertainties from unforeseen events or infrastructure disruptions. To address this, a market entry and exit real option approach is used to optimize switching between truck-only and drone-assisted delivery under stochastic demand. Results show that deploying multiple drones per truck offers significant cost advantages in high-demand regions. Using the proposed dynamic switching model, deterministic and stochastic approaches reduce costs by 17.4% and 31.3%, respectively, compared to immediate cost-saving switching. Sensitivity analysis reveals asymmetric effects of stochastic parameters on entry and exit timings. A stochastic multiple-options model is further developed to dynamically switch between truck-only and drone-assisted delivery with varying drone numbers. Applying these models to Miami-Dade County, we evaluate dynamic switching costs for three major logistics operators. This study highlights the potential benefits of dynamic delivery switching and provides insights for optimizing logistics operations.

Title: Secure ISAC Systems Empowered by Compound Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays
Authors: Mengzhen Liu, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the use of dual-functional signals inherently exposes confidential communication information during radar sensing, particularly when the sensing target itself acts as an eavesdropper. Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on directional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal processing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of spatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable antenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation patterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual angular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain and BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex optimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm leveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), second-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and BB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC systems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over conventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained. These results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly leveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure ISAC system design.

Title: Data-Driven Analysis and Predictive Control of Descriptor Systems with Application to Power and Water Networks
Authors: Yuan Zhang, Yu Wang, Jun Shang, Jinhui Zhang
Abstract: Despite growing interest in data-driven analysis and control of linear systems, descriptor systems--which are essential for modeling complex engineered systems with algebraic constraints like power and water networks--have received comparatively little attention. This paper develops a comprehensive data-driven framework for analyzing and controlling discrete-time descriptor systems without relying on explicit state-space models. We address fundamental challenges posed by non-causality through the construction of forward and backward data matrices, establishing data-based sufficient conditions for controllability and observability in terms of input-output data, where both R-controllability and C-controllability (R-observability and C-observability) have been considered. We then extend Willems' fundamental lemma to incompletely controllable systems. These methodological advances enable Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) to achieve output tracking in descriptor systems and to maintain performance under incomplete controllability conditions, as demonstrated in two case studies: i) Frequency regulation in an IEEE 9-bus power system with 3 generators, where DeePC maintained the frequency stability of the power system despite deliberate violations of R-controllability; and ii) Pressure head control in an EPANET water network with 3 tanks, 2 reservoirs, and 117 pipes, where output tracking was successfully enforced under algebraic constraints.

Title: FM OFDM Unifying High Mobility Communications and Sensing
Authors: Amir Bouziane, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is foundational to future sixth generation (6G) systems, demanding waveform co-design that supports both high throughput data transmission and accurate environmental perception. While Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) offers flexibility and backward compatibility, its high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) poses significant challenges at higher frequency bands. To address this, we investigate Frequency Modulated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (FM OFDM) a constant envelope waveform that facilitates robust joint sensing and communication under highly mobile, doubly dispersive channel conditions. We derive a comprehensive input output relationship for FM OFDM in time varying multipath channels, including analytical expressions for Inter Carrier Interference (ICI), Doppler effects, and effective channel gains. Extensive simulations comparing FM OFDM with conventional Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP OFDM) and Constant Envelope Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CE OFDM) demonstrate superior range and velocity estimation accuracy of FM-OFDM, particularly at high Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) and under high mobility, highlighting its suitability as a unified waveform for high frequency ISAC applications in 6G.

Title: A Scalable Hybrid Track-Before-Detect Tracking System: Application to Coastal Maritime Radar Surveillance
Authors: Lukas Herrmann, Ángel F. García-Fernández, Edmund F. Brekke, Egil Eide
Abstract: Despite their theoretical advantages, track-before-detect (TBD) methods remain largely absent from real-world multi-target tracking applications due to their computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper presents a scalable hybrid tracking framework that combines a TBD multi-target tracking algorithm with a detection-based multi-target tracking algorithm for coastal radar surveillance. In particular, the approach uses an integrated existence Poisson histogram-probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracking (IE-PHPMHT)-based TBD module with a conventional Poisson multi-Bernoulli Mixture (PMBM) point tracker. The system processes raw radar data through land clutter suppression, cell-wise detection, and clustering-based feature extraction. High-threshold detections are used to track strong targets via the point tracker, while low-threshold detections are employed for adaptive birth in the TBD module, enabling early initiation and sustained tracking of weak or ambiguous targets. Validated using real X-band radar data from the Trondheim Fjord, Norway, the approach demonstrates robust multi-target tracking performance in a full-scale application with a large observation area under resource constraints, highlighting its suitability for operational deployment in complex maritime environments needed for coastal surveillance and to support autonomy.

Title: A Joint Delay-Energy-Security Aware Framework for Intelligent Task Scheduling in Satellite-Terrestrial Edge Computing Network
Authors: Yuhao Zheng, Ting You, Kejia Peng, Chang Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for secure task scheduling in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs). The framework jointly considers secure user association and task offloading to balance transmission delay, energy consumption, and physical-layer security. To address the inherent complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages. In the first stage, a secrecy-aware user association strategy is designed by discretizing artificial noise (AN) power ratios and identifying feasible links that satisfy secrecy constraints, resulting in a set of candidate secure associations. In the second stage, we formulate a delay-energy-aware task scheduling problem as an integer linear program and solve it using a heuristic Mayfly Algorithm (MA) to obtain low-complexity, high-quality solutions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in achieving secure and efficient task scheduling under dynamic satellite environments.

Title: Hybrid Precoding Revisited: Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective for MU-MIMO Systems
Authors: Mintaek Oh, Jinseok Choi
Abstract: This letter presents a low-complexity hybrid precoding framework for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging a low-dimensional subspace property. Under the low-dimensional subspace perspective, we first identify an unconstrained optimal radio-frequency (RF) precoder. We then optimize a hybrid precoder via a reduced-complexity precoding method. We further extend the proposed framework to (i) a dynamic-subarray antenna partitioning algorithm that adaptively allocates subsets of antennas associated with RF chains, and (ii) a channel covariance-based approach to exploit statistical channel state information at a transmitter (CSIT), ensuring robustness with partial CSIT. Simulations validate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance while significantly reducing complexity compared to existing methods.

Title: Hybrid Pruning: In-Situ Compression of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Speaker Verification and Anti-Spoofing
Authors: Junyi Peng, Lin Zhang, Jiangyu Han, Oldřich Plchot, Johan Rohdin, Themos Stafylakis, Shuai Wang, Jan Černocký
Abstract: Although large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) models like WavLM have achieved state-of-the-art performance in speech processing, their significant size impedes deployment on resource-constrained devices. While structured pruning is a key technique for model compression, existing methods typically separate it from task-specific fine-tuning. This multi-stage approach struggles to create optimal architectures tailored for diverse downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that integrates structured pruning into the downstream fine-tuning process. Our framework unifies these steps, jointly optimizing for task performance and model sparsity in a single stage. This allows the model to learn a compressed architecture specifically for the end task, eliminating the need for complex multi-stage pipelines and knowledge distillation. Our pruned models achieve up to a 70\% parameter reduction with negligible performance degradation on large-scale datasets, achieving equal error rates of 0.7\%, 0.8\%, and 1.6\% on Vox1-O, -E, and -H, respectively. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates improved generalization in low-resource scenarios, reducing overfitting and achieving a state-of-the-art 3.7\% EER on ASVspoof5.

Title: Resilient Control for Networked Switched Systems With/Without ACK: An Active Quantized Framework
Authors: Rui Zhao, Zhiqiang Zuo, Yijing Wang, Wentao Zhang, Yang Shi
Abstract: This paper deals with the quantized control problem for switched systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Considering the system's defensive capability and the computational resources of quantizers and controllers, four control strategies are proposed. These strategies incorporate different combinations of controllers (active and passive), quantizers (centered on the origin or custom-designed), and network configurations (with or without ACK signals). For each strategy, specific update laws for the encoder and decoder are designed to avoid quantization saturation. Furthermore, the uniformity of encoder and decoder operations is maintained by transmitting additional information to the decoder. To achieve asymptotic stability, sufficient conditions concerning the switching signal and DoS attack constraints are derived by taking into account the asynchronous behaviors. The proposed active quantization strategy with the ACK signal leverages the system model information to compute the control signal in real-time, allowing for possible convergence of the system state despite DoS attack. Additionally, a well-designed switching signal is suggested to further mitigate the impact of DoS attack. A passive quantization strategy with ACK signal is also developed as a simplified version of the active quantized control strategy, providing the foundation for a strategy without ACK signal. Inspired by time-triggered and event-triggered mechanisms, the passive quantization strategy without ACK signal is investigated, with two feasible update laws for the quantizer. Finally, two simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Title: Decoding MGMT Methylation: A Step Towards Precision Medicine in Glioblastoma
Authors: Hafeez Ur Rehman, Sumaiya Fazal, Moutaz Alazab, Ali Baydoun
Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first, generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Title: Performance analysis for cone-preserving switched systems with constrained switching
Authors: Marc Seidel, Richard Pates, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: This paper studies cone-preserving linear discrete-time switched systems whose switching is governed by an automaton. For this general system class, we present performance analysis conditions for a broadly usable performance measure. In doing so, we generalize several known results for performance and stability analysis for switched and positive switched systems, providing a unifying perspective. We also arrive at novel $\ell_1$-performance analysis conditions for positive switched systems with constrained switching, for which we present an application-motivated numerical example. Further, the cone-preserving perspective provides insights into appropriate Lyapunov function selection.

Title: Wide-Area Power System Oscillations from Large-Scale AI Workloads
Authors: Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu
Abstract: This paper develops a new dynamic power profiling approach for modeling AI-centric datacenter loads and analyzing their impact on grid operations, particularly their potential to induce wide-area grid oscillations. We characterize the periodic stochastic power fluctuations inherent to large-scale AI workloads during both the training and fine-tuning stages, driven by the state-of-the-art GPU computing architecture designs. These sustained, large power fluctuations, unlike conventional load ramping, act as persistent forcing inputs capable of interacting with and amplifying local and inter-area oscillation modes. Using the WECC 179-bus system as a test case, we examine the amplitude and variability of oscillatory responses under different factors, ranging from system strength, penetration level, fluctuation frequency range, individual datacenter size, to geographical deployment. Simulation results show that, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or dispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes. Our models and numerical studies provide a quantitative basis for integrating AI-dominant electricity demands into grid oscillation studies, and further support the development of new planning and operational measures to power the continuous AI load growth.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-based Control via Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs)
Authors: Austin Braniff, Yuhe Tian
Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this, we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering safety constraints.

Title: Disentangled Multi-modal Learning of Histology and Transcriptomics for Cancer Characterization
Authors: Yupei Zhang, Xiaofei Wang, Anran Liu, Lequan Yu, Chao Li
Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Multi-agent Robust and Optimal Policy Learning for Data Harvesting
Authors: Shili Wu, Yancheng Zhu, Aniruddha Datta, Sean B. Andersson
Abstract: We consider the problem of using multiple agents to harvest data from a collection of sensor nodes (targets) scattered across a two-dimensional environment. These targets transmit their data to the agents that move in the space above them, and our goal is for the agents to collect data from the targets as efficiently as possible while moving to their final destinations. The agents are assumed to have a continuous control action, and we leverage reinforcement learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Lagrangian Penalty (LP), to identify highly effective solutions. Additionally, we enhance the controller's robustness by incorporating regularization at each state to smooth the learned policy. We conduct a series of simulations to demonstrate our approach and validate its performance and robustness.

Title: Parameter-Free Logit Distillation via Sorting Mechanism
Authors: Stephen Ekaputra Limantoro
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher (larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy, which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal: (1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2) reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Time-Aware One Step Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Tainyi Zhang, Zheng-Peng Duan, Peng-Tao Jiang, Bo Li, Ming-Ming Cheng, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li
Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder, which projects the same image into different latent features based on timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features, the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results with only a single step.

Title: A Disease-Centric Vision-Language Foundation Model for Precision Oncology in Kidney Cancer

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors. In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866 CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726, representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Title: Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for MEC-assisted Consumer Internet of Vehicle Systems
Authors: Yanheng Liu, Dalin Li, Hao Wu, Zemin Sun, Weihong Qin, Jun Li, Hongyang Du, Geng Sun
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted internet of vehicle (IoV) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide computing services for vehicles. However, meeting the computing-sensitive and computation-intensive demands of vehicles poses several challenges, including the discrepancy between the limited resource provision and stringent computing requirement, the difficulty in capturing and integrating the intricate features of the MEC-assisted IoV system into the problem formulation, and the need for real-time processing and efficient resource management in the dynamic environment. In this work, we explore the AI-enabled task offloading and resource allocation for MEC-assisted consumer IoV systems. Specifically, we first present a multi-MEC-assisted consumer IoV architecture that leverages the computational resources of MEC servers to provide offloading services close to vehicles. Subsequently, we formulate a system cost minimization optimization problem (SCMOP) by integrating the service delay and energy consumption. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation approach (JTOCRA) by applying the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JTOCRA can achieve superior system performances and exhibits better scalability compared to other alternative approaches.

Title: Mini-Omni-Reasoner: Token-Level Thinking-in-Speaking in Large Speech Models
Authors: Zhifei Xie, Ziyang Ma, Zihang Liu, Kaiyu Pang, Hongyu Li, Jialin Zhang, Yue Liao, Deheng Ye, Chunyan Miao, Shuicheng Yan
Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Title: Beyond Transcription: Mechanistic Interpretability in ASR
Authors: Neta Glazer, Yael Segal-Feldman, Hilit Segev, Aviv Shamsian, Asaf Buchnick, Gill Hetz, Ethan Fetaya, Joseph Keshet, Aviv Navon
Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention, particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving model transparency and robustness.

Title: Tri-Hybrid Beamforming for Radiation-Center Reconfigurable Antenna Array: Spectral Efficiency and Energy Efficiency
Authors: Yinchen Li, Chenhao Qi, Shiwen Mao, Octavia A. Dobre
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a tri-hybrid beamforming (THBF) architecture based on the radiation-center (RC) reconfigurable antenna array (RCRAA), including the digital beamforming, analog beamforming, and electromagnetic (EM) beamforming, where the EM beamformer design is modeled as RC selection. Aiming at spectral efficiency (SE) maximization subject to the hardware and power consumption constraints, we propose a tri-loop alternating optimization (TLAO) scheme for the THBF design, where the digital and analog beamformers are optimized based on the penalty dual decomposition in the inner and middle loops, and the RC selection is determined through the coordinate descent method in the outer loop. Aiming at energy-efficiency (EE) maximization, we develop a dual quadratic transform-based fractional programming (DQTFP) scheme, where the TLAO scheme is readily used for the THBF design. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose the Lagrange dual transform-based fractional programming (LDTFP) scheme, where each iteration has a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the great potential of the RCRAA in improving both SE and EE. Compared to the DQTFP scheme, the LDTFP scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity with only minor performance loss.

Title: QvTAD: Differential Relative Attribute Learning for Voice Timbre Attribute Detection
Authors: Zhiyu Wu, Jingyi Fang, Yufei Tang, Yuanzhong Zheng, Yaoxuan Wang, Haojun Fei
Abstract: Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) plays a pivotal role in fine-grained timbre modeling for speech generation tasks. However, it remains challenging due to the inherently subjective nature of timbre descriptors and the severe label imbalance in existing datasets. In this work, we present QvTAD, a novel pairwise comparison framework based on differential attention, designed to enhance the modeling of perceptual timbre attributes. To address the label imbalance in the VCTK-RVA dataset, we introduce a graph-based data augmentation strategy that constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph and employs Disjoint-Set Union techniques to automatically mine unobserved utterance pairs with valid attribute comparisons. Our framework leverages speaker embeddings from a pretrained FACodec, and incorporates a Relative Timbre Shift-Aware Differential Attention module. This module explicitly models attribute-specific contrasts between paired utterances via differential denoising and contrast amplification mechanisms. Experimental results on the VCTK-RVA benchmark demonstrate that QvTAD achieves substantial improvements across multiple timbre descriptors, with particularly notable gains in cross-speaker generalization scenarios.

Title: Automatic Retrieval of Specific Cows from Unlabeled Videos
Authors: Jiawen Lyu, Manu Ramesh, Madison Simonds, Jacquelyn P. Boerman, Amy R. Reibman
Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder, which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

Title: Advancing rail safety: An onboard measurement system of rolling stock wheel flange wear based on dynamic machine learning algorithms
Authors: Celestin Nkundineza, James Ndodana Njaji, Samrawit Abubeker, Omar Gatera, Damien Hanyurwimfura
Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Title: Vector preference-based contextual bandits under distributional shifts
Authors: Apurv Shukla, P.R. Kumar
Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in presence of distribution shifts.

Title: CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics
Authors: Jong-Hwan Jang, Junho Song, Yong-Yeon Jo
Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more effective clinical decision-making.

Title: Machine Learning in Micromobility: A Systematic Review of Datasets, Techniques, and Applications
Authors: Sen Yan, Chinmaya Kaundanya, Noel E. O'Connor, Suzanne Little, Mingming Liu
Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency, environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal, and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages, challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety, focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help future researchers better understand this field.

Title: Head-Related Transfer Function Individualization Using Anthropometric Features and Spatially Independent Latent Representation
Authors: Ryan Niu, Shoichi Koyama, Tomohiko Nakamura
Abstract: A method for head-related transfer function (HRTF) individualization from the subject's anthropometric parameters is proposed. Due to the high cost of measurement, the number of subjects included in many HRTF datasets is limited, and the number of those that include anthropometric parameters is even smaller. Therefore, HRTF individualization based on deep neural networks (DNNs) is a challenging task. We propose a HRTF individualization method using the latent representation of HRTF magnitude obtained through an autoencoder conditioned on sound source positions, which makes it possible to combine multiple HRTF datasets with different measured source positions, and makes the network training tractable by reducing the number of parameters to be estimated from anthropometric parameters. Experimental evaluation shows that high estimation accuracy is achieved by the proposed method, compared to current DNN-based methods.

Title: Motor Imagery EEG Signal Classification Using Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning
Authors: Jamal Hwaidi, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem
Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.

Title: LLM-Assisted Semantic Alignment and Integration in Collaborative Model-Based Systems Engineering Using SysML v2
Authors: Zirui Li, Stephan Husung, Haoze Wang
Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling. Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.

Title: Well-posedness of Lur'e systems with feedthrough
Authors: Chris Guiver, Hartmut Logemann
Abstract: For a large class of Lur'e systems with time-varying nonlinearities and feedthrough we consider several well-posedness issues, namely: existence, continuation, blow-up in finite-time, forward completeness and uniqueness of solutions. Lur'e systems with feedthrough are systems of forced, nonlinear ordinary differential equations coupled with a nonlinear algebraic equation determining the output of the system. The presence of feedthrough means that the algebraic equation is implicit in the output, and, in general, the output may not be expressible by an analytic formula in terms of the state and the input. Simple examples illustrate that the well-posedness properties of such systems are not necessarily guaranteed by assumptions sufficient for the corresponding well-posedness properties of Lur'e systems without feedthrough. We provide sufficient conditions for the well-posedness properties mentioned above, using global inversion theorems from real analysis and tools from non-smooth analysis and differential inclusions. The theory is illustrated with examples.

Title: A XAI-based Framework for Frequency Subband Characterization of Cough Spectrograms in Chronic Respiratory Disease
Authors: Patricia Amado-Caballero, Luis M. San-José-Revuelta, Xinheng Wang, José Ramón Garmendia-Leiza, Carlos Alberola-López, Pablo Casaseca-de-la-Higuera
Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Title: Robust Small Methane Plume Segmentation in Satellite Imagery
Authors: Khai Duc Minh Tran, Hoa Van Nguyen, Aimuni Binti Muhammad Rawi, Hareeshrao Athinarayanarao, Ba-Ngu Vo
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

Title: Causal Beam Selection for Reliable Initial Access in AI-driven Beam Management
Authors: Nasir Khan, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil, Sinem Coleri
Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond, where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing only on causally relevant features.

Title: Beyond Interpretability: Exploring the Comprehensibility of Adaptive Video Streaming through Large Language Models
Authors: Lianchen Jia, Chaoyang Li, Ziqi Yuan, Jiahui Chen, Tianchi Huang, Jiangchuan Liu, Lifeng Sun
Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion, interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree}, the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility, ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree} significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive performance, showing potential for further advancement.

Title: Towards User-level QoE: Large-scale Practice in Personalized Optimization of Adaptive Video Streaming
Authors: Lianchen Jia, Chao Zhou, Chaoyang Li, Jiangchuan Liu, Lifeng Sun
Abstract: Traditional optimization methods based on system-wide Quality of Service (QoS) metrics have approached their performance limitations in modern large-scale streaming systems. However, aligning user-level Quality of Experience~(QoE) with algorithmic optimization objectives remains an unresolved challenge. Therefore, we propose \texttt{LingXi}, the first large-scale deployed system for personalized adaptive video streaming based on user-level experience. \texttt{LingXi} dynamically optimizes the objectives of adaptive video streaming algorithms by analyzing user engagement. Utilizing exit rate as a key metric, we investigate the correlation between QoS indicators and exit rates based on production environment logs, subsequently developing a personalized exit rate predictor. Through Monte Carlo sampling and online Bayesian optimization, we iteratively determine optimal parameters. Large-scale A/B testing utilizing 8\% of traffic on Kuaishou, one of the largest short video platforms, demonstrates \texttt{LingXi}'s superior performance. \texttt{LingXi} achieves a 0.15\% increase in total viewing time, a 0.1\% improvement in bitrate, and a 1.3\% reduction in stall time across all users, with particularly significant improvements for low-bandwidth users who experience a 15\% reduction in stall time.

Title: NOSTRA: A noise-resilient and sparse data framework for trust region based multi objective Bayesian optimization
Authors: Maryam Ghasemzadeh, Anton van Beek
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs. These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g., randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result, experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.

Title: Terrain Classification for the Spot Quadrupedal Mobile Robot Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing
Authors: Sophie Villemure, Jefferson Silveira, Joshua A. Marshall
Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types. These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate. The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces, joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy of approximately 97%

Title: TinyML Towards Industry 4.0: Resource-Efficient Process Monitoring of a Milling Machine
Authors: Tim Langer, Matthias Widra, Volkhard Beyer
Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.

Title: Privacy in Speech Technology
Authors: Tom Bäckström
Abstract: Speech technology for communication, accessing information, and services has rapidly improved in quality. It is convenient and appealing because speech is the primary mode of communication for humans. Such technology, however, also presents proven threats to privacy. Speech is a tool for communication and it will thus inherently contain private information. Importantly, it however also contains a wealth of side information, such as information related to health, emotions, affiliations, and relationships, all of which are private. Exposing such private information can lead to serious threats such as price gouging, harassment, extortion, and stalking. This paper is a tutorial on privacy issues related to speech technology, modeling their threats, approaches for protecting users' privacy, measuring the performance of privacy-protecting methods, perception of privacy as well as societal and legal consequences. In addition to a tutorial overview, it also presents lines for further development where improvements are most urgently needed.

Title: Enhancing Code-switched Text-to-Speech Synthesis Capability in Large Language Models with only Monolingual Corpora
Authors: Jing Xu, Daxin Tan, Jiaqi Wang, Xiao Chen
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in speech generation and recognition, their applications are mainly confined to monolingual scenarios, with limited explorations in code-switched (CS) contexts. In this paper, we propose a Code-Switched Large Language Model (CS-LLM) to enhance the code-switched text-to-speech synthesis (CS TTS) capability in LLMs with only monolingual corpora. Specifically, we begin by enhancing the multilingual speech processing ability of LLMs through multilingual speech recognition and synthesis tasks. Then, we develop an effective code-switched (CS) data construction strategy that splits and concatenates words from different monolingual speech corpora to equip LLMs with improved CS TTS ability. Experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines in CS TTS in terms of naturalness, speaker consistency and similarity even with limited data. Additionally, the constructed CS data further improves multilingual speech synthesis and recognition.

Title: Data-conforming data-driven control: avoiding premature generalizations beyond data
Authors: Mohammad Ramadan, Evan Toler, Mihai Anitescu
Abstract: Data-driven and adaptive control approaches face the problem of introducing sudden distributional shifts beyond the distribution of data encountered during learning. Therefore, they are prone to invalidating the very assumptions used in their own construction. This is due to the linearity of the underlying system, inherently assumed and formulated in most data-driven control approaches, which may falsely generalize the behavior of the system beyond the behavior experienced in the data. This paper seeks to mitigate these problems by enforcing consistency of the newly designed closed-loop systems with data and slowing down any distributional shifts in the joint state-input space. This is achieved through incorporating affine regularization terms and linear matrix inequality constraints to data-driven approaches, resulting in convex semi-definite programs that can be efficiently solved by standard software packages. We discuss the optimality conditions of these programs and then conclude the paper with a numerical example that further highlights the problem of premature generalization beyond data and shows the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in enhancing the safety of data-driven control methods.

Title: Adaptive Transmit Beamforming for DoA Estimation in Dynamic and Resource-Constrained DFRC Systems
Authors: D.R. Raghavendra, V.V. Reddy, A. Mishra
Abstract: Dual-function radar communication (DFRC) systems incorporate both radar and communication functions by sharing spectrum, hardware and radio frequency (RF) chains. Future technologies, such as 6G, are envisioned to support multiple communication platforms along with radar sensing, thus leading to competition for the available resources and variability in their allocation. If communication takes precedence over sensing, the RF chains and antennas allocated to sensing are less and potentially changing for every communication frame. Consequently, sensing over the entire field-of-view (FOV) within a frame with varying resources requires real-time adaptive beamforming strategy. Existing sensing techniques such as time-division multiplexing, sequential scan over the FOV and beam redesign using optimization approaches are impractical in such scenarios due to high latency and execution overheads. We propose a resource-aware technique for transmit analog beamformer design to sense the entire FOV within the communication frame. The proposed technique leverages time-sliced beam allocation along with adaptive windowing to result in a balanced cumulative array factor over the FOV thereby ensuring better direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation reliability. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed technique has consistent target detection and angle estimation performance in all directions and adapts to varying resource availability with time.

Title: Non-asymptotic Error Analysis of Subspace Identification for Deterministic Systems
Authors: Shuai Sun
Abstract: The subspace identification method (SIM) has been extensively employed in the identification of discrete-time multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This paper focuses on the analysis of perturbation errors for the system matrices in state-space models and the corresponding system poles, under two unified SIMs, based on a single finite-length input/output sample trajectory. Specifically, we derive non-asymptotic upper bounds on these errors, providing a unified perspective across various SIM variants. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when the state-to-output dimensionality ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of system parameters. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIMs.

Title: AI-Powered CPS-Enabled Urban Transportation Digital Twin: Methods and Applications
Authors: Yongjie Fu, Mehmet K.Turkcan, Mahshid Ghasemi, Zhaobin Mo, Chengbo Zang, Abhishek Adhikari, Zoran Kostic, Gil Zussman, Xuan Di
Abstract: We present methods and applications for the development of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its ``eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add value to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies, in other words, cyberphysical systems (CPS). We will first review the DT pipeline enabled by CPS and propose our DT architecture deployed on a real-world testbed in New York City. This paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.

Title: Adaptive Task Space Non-Singular Terminal Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control of a 7-DOF Robotic Manipulator
Authors: L. Wan (1), S. Smith (1 and 2), Y.-J. Pan (1), E. Witrant (1 and 2) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, (2) GIPSA-lab CNRS, University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France)
Abstract: This paper presents a new task-space Non-singular Terminal Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (NT-STSM) controller with adaptive gains for robust trajectory tracking of a 7-DOF robotic manipulator. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking, making it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A rigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for practical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external disturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking with reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other NT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the proposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex motions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and various industrial applications.

Title: QoS-Aware NOMA Design for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Zhiguo Ding, Donghong Cai, Vincent W.S. Wong
Abstract: Pinching antennas, implemented by applying small dielectric particles on a waveguide, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology ideal for next-generation wireless communications systems. Unlike conventional flexible-antenna systems, pinching antennas offer the advantage of creating line-of-sight links by enabling antennas to be activated on the waveguide at a location close to the user. This paper investigates a typical two-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink scenario, where multiple pinching antennas are activated on a single dielectric waveguide to assist NOMA transmission. We formulate the problem of maximizing the data rate of one user subject to the quality-of-service requirement of the other user by jointly optimizing the antenna locations and power allocation coefficients. The formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve due to the impact of antenna locations on large-scale path loss and two types of phase shifts, namely in-waveguide phase shifts and free space propagation phase shifts. To this end, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Moreover, we consider the special case with a single pinching antenna, which is a simplified version of the multi-antenna case. Although the formulated problem is still nonconvex, by using the inherent features of the formulated problem, we derive the global optimal solution in closed-form, which offers important insights on the performance of pinching-antenna systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the pinching-antenna system significantly outperforms conventional fixed-position antenna systems, and the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the computationally intensive exhaustive search based approach.

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. We present a comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend toward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference was minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original speech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve both privacy and perceptual integrity.

Title: Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy Measurements without Reconstruction
Authors: Navya Sonal Agarwal, Jan Philipp Schneider, Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota, Syed Muhammad Kazim, John Meshreki, Ivo Ihrke, Michael Moeller
Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.

Title: Transient performance of MPC for tracking without terminal constraints
Authors: Nadine Ehmann, Matthias Köhler, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for tracking is a recently introduced approach, which extends standard MPC formulations by incorporating an artificial reference as an additional optimization variable, in order to track external and potentially time-varying references. In this work, we analyze the performance of such an MPC for tracking scheme without a terminal cost and terminal constraints. We derive a transient performance estimate, i.e. a bound on the closed-loop performance over an arbitrary time interval, yielding insights on how to select the scheme's parameters for performance. Furthermore, we show that in the asymptotic case, where the prediction horizon and observed time interval tend to infinity, the closed-loop solution of MPC for tracking recovers the infinite horizon optimal solution.

Title: Improving U-Net Confidence on TEM Image Data with L2-Regularization, Transfer Learning, and Deep Fine-Tuning
Authors: Aiden Ochoa, Xinyuan Xu, Xing Wang
Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for natural images. We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization, semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we found that our approach led to a 57% increase in defect detection rate, which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.

Title: Evaluating Speech-to-Text x LLM x Text-to-Speech Combinations for AI Interview Systems
Authors: Rumi Allbert, Nima Yazdani, Ali Ansari, Aruj Mahajan, Amirhossein Afsharrad, Seyed Shahabeddin Mousavi
Abstract: Voice-based conversational AI systems increasingly rely on cascaded architectures that combine speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) components. We present a large-scale empirical comparison of STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data sampled from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. We used an LLM-as-a-Judge automated evaluation framework to assess conversational quality, technical accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities. Our analysis of five production configurations reveals that a stack combining Google's STT, GPT-4.1, and Cartesia's TTS outperforms alternatives in both objective quality metrics and user satisfaction scores. Surprisingly, we find that objective quality metrics correlate weakly with user satisfaction scores, suggesting that user experience in voice-based AI systems depends on factors beyond technical performance. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversations and contribute a validated evaluation methodology for human-AI interactions.

Title: Evaluation of 3D Counterfactual Brain MRI Generation
Authors: Pengwei Sun, Wei Peng, Lun Yu Li, Yixin Wang, Kilian M. Pohl
Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data. However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture anatomical interdependencies.

Title: Evaluating the Predictive Value of Preoperative MRI for Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy
Authors: Gideon N. L. Rouwendaal, Daniël Boeke, Inge L. Cox, Henk G. van der Poel, Margriet C. van Dijk-de Haan, Regina G. H. Beets-Tan, Thierry N. Boellaard, Wilson Silva
Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and (4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models (maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches (AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

Title: RedDino: A foundation model for red blood cell analysis
Authors: Luca Zedda, Andrea Loddo, Cecilia Di Ruberto, Carsten Marr
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders. Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification. Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance. RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are available at this https URL, and the pretrained models can be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at this https URL

Title: IDSO-Managed Bid-Based Transactive Distribution Systems Design for DER Participation in Wholesale Markets While Preserving T-D Interactions
Authors: Swastik Sharma, Swathi Battula, Sri Niwas Singh
Abstract: Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in bid-based Transactive Energy Systems (TES) at the distribution systems facilitates strongly coupled, bidirectional interactions between Transmission-Distribution (T-D) systems. Capturing these interactions is critical for ensuring seamless integration within an Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) framework. This study proposes a methodology to preserve such tight T-D linkages by developing an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) managed bid-based TES design for unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed design operates within the ITD paradigm and permits DER participation in the Wholesale Power Market (WPM) through IDSO while preserving tight T-D linkages. To this end, this research offers the following key contributions: a novel bid/offer prequalification-cum-aggregation method to ensure a grid-safe and value-based aggregation of DERs' bids and offers for WPM participation through IDSO; and a retail pricing mechanism that reflects the true value of procuring or offering additional units of power within the distribution system. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 123-bus radial feeder populated with a high DER concentration to validate the proposed frameworks' effectiveness in coordinating the DERs efficiently and reliably.

Title: Bayesian-Driven Graph Reasoning for Active Radio Map Construction
Authors: Wenlihan Lu, Shijian Gao, Miaowen Wen, Yuxuan Liang, Liuqing Yang, Chan-Byoung Chae, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.

Title: Joint Optimization of Energy Consumption and Completion Time in Federated Learning
Authors: Xinyu Zhou, Jun Zhao, Huimei Han, Claude Guet
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.

Title: Seamless Language Expansion: Enhancing Multilingual Mastery in Self-Supervised Models
Authors: Jing Xu, Minglin Wu, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng
Abstract: Self-supervised (SSL) models have shown great performance in various downstream tasks. However, they are typically developed for limited languages, and may encounter new languages in real-world. Developing a SSL model for each new language is costly. Thus, it is vital to figure out how to efficiently adapt existed SSL models to a new language without impairing its original abilities. We propose adaptation methods which integrate LoRA to existed SSL models to extend new language. We also develop preservation strategies which include data combination and re-clustering to retain abilities on existed languages. Applied to mHuBERT, we investigate their effectiveness on speech re-synthesis task. Experiments show that our adaptation methods enable mHuBERT to be applied to a new language (Mandarin) with MOS value increased about 1.6 and the relative value of WER reduced up to 61.72%. Also, our preservation strategies ensure that the performance on both existed and new languages remains intact.

Title: Sentiment Reasoning for Healthcare
Authors: Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Khai Le-Duc, Bach Phan Tat, Duy Le, Long Vo-Dang, Truong-Son Hy
Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial. By incorporating rationales to explain reason for each predicted label, users could understand Large Language Models (LLMs)'s reasoning to make better decision. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, and our proposed multimodal multitask framework and the world's largest multimodal sentiment analysis dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model's classification performance (+2% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (five languages - Vietnamese, English, Chinese, German, and French) and models are published online: this https URL

Title: Environmental Feature Engineering and Statistical Validation for ML-Based Path Loss Prediction
Authors: Jonathan Ethier, Mathieu Chateauvert, Ryan G. Dempsey, Alexis Bose
Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.

Title: Partially Decentralized Multi-Agent Q-Learning via Digital Cousins for Wireless Networks
Authors: Talha Bozkus, Urbashi Mitra
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Title: MambaIC: State Space Models for High-Performance Learned Image Compression
Authors: Fanhu Zeng, Hao Tang, Yihua Shao, Siyu Chen, Ling Shao, Yan Wang
Abstract: A high-performance image compression algorithm is crucial for real-time information transmission across numerous fields. Despite rapid progress in image compression, computational inefficiency and poor redundancy modeling still pose significant bottlenecks, limiting practical applications. Inspired by the effectiveness of state space models (SSMs) in capturing long-range dependencies, we leverage SSMs to address computational inefficiency in existing methods and improve image compression from multiple perspectives. In this paper, we integrate the advantages of SSMs for better efficiency-performance trade-off and propose an enhanced image compression approach through refined context modeling, which we term MambaIC. Specifically, we explore context modeling to adaptively refine the representation of hidden states. Additionally, we introduce window-based local attention into channel-spatial entropy modeling to reduce potential spatial redundancy during compression, thereby increasing efficiency. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, particularly for high-resolution image compression. Code is released at this https URL.

Title: Adaptive Multi-Order Graph Regularized NMF with Dual Sparsity for Hyperspectral Unmixing
Authors: Hui Chen, Liangyu Liu, Xianchao Xiu, Wanquan Liu
Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a critical yet challenging task in remote sensing. However, existing nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods with graph learning mostly focus on first-order or second-order nearest neighbor relationships and usually require manual parameter tuning, which fails to characterize intrinsic data structures. To address the above issues, we propose a novel adaptive multi-order graph regularized NMF method (MOGNMF) with three key features. First, multi-order graph regularization is introduced into the NMF framework to exploit global and local information comprehensively. Second, these parameters associated with the multi-order graph are learned adaptively through a data-driven approach. Third, dual sparsity is embedded to obtain better robustness, i.e., $\ell_{1/2}$-norm on the abundance matrix and $\ell_{2,1}$-norm on the noise matrix. To solve the proposed model, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm whose subproblems have explicit solutions, thus ensuring effectiveness. Experiments on simulated and real hyperspectral data indicate that the proposed method delivers better unmixing results.

Title: TAGA: A Tangent-Based Reactive Approach for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation Around Human Groups
Authors: Utsha Kumar Roy, Sejuti Rahman
Abstract: Robot navigation in densely populated environments presents significant challenges, particularly regarding the interplay between individual and group dynamics. Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with individual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally form in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing group-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of individual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate navigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to incorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent Action for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be integrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness capabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent action-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's capacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group Collision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively robots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with state-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL) reduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success rates and navigation efficiency. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and validation of this approach.

Title: Hyper Yoshimura: How a slight tweak on a classical folding pattern unleashes meta-stability for deployable robots
Authors: Ziyang Zhou, Yogesh Phalak, Vishrut Deshpande, Ethan O'Brien, Ian Walker, Suyi Li
Abstract: Deployable structures inspired by origami have provided lightweight, compact, and reconfigurable solutions for various robotic and architectural applications. However, creating an integrated structural system that can effectively balance the competing requirements of high packing efficiency, simple deployment, and precise morphing into multiple load-bearing configurations remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a new class of hyper-Yoshimura origami, which exhibits a wide range of kinematically admissible and locally metastable states, including newly discovered symmetric "self-packing" and asymmetric "pop-out" states. This metastability is achieved by breaking a design rule of Yoshimura origami that has been in place for many decades. To this end, this study derives a new set of mathematically rigorous design rules and geometric formulations. Based on this, forward and inverse kinematic strategies are developed to stack hyper-Yoshimura modules into deployable booms that can approximate complex 3D shapes. Finally, this study showcases the potential of hyper-Yoshimura with a meter-scale pop-up cellphone charging station deployed at our university's bus transit station, along with a 3D-printed, scaled prototype of a space crane that can function as an object manipulator, solar tracking device, or high-load-bearing structure. These results establish hyper-Yoshimura as a promising platform for deployable and adaptable robotic systems in both terrestrial and space environments.

Authors: Zheng Zhao
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.

Title: Improving Speech Enhancement with Multi-Metric Supervision from Learned Quality Assessment
Authors: Wei Wang, Wangyou Zhang, Chenda Li, Jiatong Shi, Shinji Watanabe, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) aims to predict the perceived quality of speech signals under a wide range of distortions. It is inherently connected to speech enhancement (SE), which seeks to improve speech quality by removing unwanted signal components. While SQA models are widely used to evaluate SE performance, their potential to guide SE training remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate a training framework that leverages a SQA model, trained to predict multiple evaluation metrics from a public SE leaderboard, as a supervisory signal for SE. This approach addresses a key limitation of conventional SE objectives, such as SI-SNR, which often fail to align with perceptual quality and generalize poorly across evaluation metrics. Moreover, it enables training on real-world data where clean references are unavailable. Experiments on both simulated and real-world test sets show that SQA-guided training consistently improves performance across a range of quality metrics.

Title: Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data
Authors: Mohammad Alikhani, Reza Kazemi
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.

Title: Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity
Authors: Huiling Yang, Zhanwei Wang, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.
