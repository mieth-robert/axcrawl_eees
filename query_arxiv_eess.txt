Title: ZUNA: Flexible EEG Superresolution with Position-Aware Diffusion Autoencoders
Authors: Christopher Warner, Jonas Mago, JR Huml, Mohamed Osman, Beren Millidge
Abstract: We present \texttt{ZUNA}, a 380M-parameter masked diffusion autoencoder trained to perform masked channel infilling and superresolution for arbitrary electrode numbers and positions in EEG signals. The \texttt{ZUNA} architecture tokenizes multichannel EEG into short temporal windows and injects spatiotemporal structure via a 4D rotary positional encoding over (x,y,z,t), enabling inference on arbitrary channel subsets and positions. We train ZUNA on an aggregated and harmonized corpus spanning 208 public datasets containing approximately 2 million channel-hours using a combined reconstruction and heavy channel-dropout objective. We show that \texttt{ZUNA} substantially improves over ubiquitous spherical-spline interpolation methods, with the gap widening at higher dropout rates. Crucially, compared to other deep learning methods in this space, \texttt{ZUNA}'s performance \emph{generalizes} across datasets and channel positions allowing it to be applied directly to novel datasets and problems. Despite its generative capabilities, \texttt{ZUNA} remains computationally practical for deployment. We release Apache-2.0 weights and an MNE-compatible preprocessing/inference stack to encourage reproducible comparisons and downstream use in EEG analysis pipelines.

Title: Triggering hallucinations in model-based MRI reconstruction via adversarial perturbations
Authors: Suna Buğday, Yvan Saeys, Jonathan Peck
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used to improve the quality of medical imaging, such as reconstruction of magnetic resonance images and computed tomography. However, it is well-known that such models are susceptible to hallucinations: they may insert features into the reconstructed image which are not actually present in the original image. In a medical setting, such hallucinations may endanger patient health as they can lead to incorrect diagnoses. In this work, we aim to quantify the extent to which state-of-the-art generative models suffer from hallucinations in the context of magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Specifically, we craft adversarial perturbations resembling random noise for the unprocessed input images which induce hallucinations when reconstructed using a generative model. We perform this evaluation on the brain and knee images from the fastMRI data set using UNet and end-to-end VarNet architectures to reconstruct the images. Our results show that these models are highly susceptible to small perturbations and can be easily coaxed into producing hallucinations. This fragility may partially explain why hallucinations occur in the first place and suggests that a carefully constructed adversarial training routine may reduce their prevalence. Moreover, these hallucinations cannot be reliably detected using traditional image quality metrics. Novel approaches will therefore need to be developed to detect when hallucinations have occurred.

Title: 4D-UNet improves clutter rejection in human transcranial contrast enhanced ultrasound
Authors: Tristan Beruard, Armand Delbos, Arthur Chavignon, Maxence Reberol, Vincent Hingot
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is limited by high skull absorption, limiting vascular imaging to only the largest vessels. Traditional clutter filters struggle with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ultrasound datasets, where blood and tissue signals cannot be easily separated, even when the echogenicity of the blood is improved with contrast agents. Here, we present a novel 4D U-Net approach for clutter filtering in transcranial 3D Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) exploiting spatial and temporal information via a 4D-UNet implementation to enhance microbubble detection in transcranial data acquired in human adults. Our results show that the 4D-UNet improves temporal clutter filters. By integrating deep learning into CEUS, this study advances neurovascular imaging, offering improved clutter rejection and visualization. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven approaches to enhance ultrasound-based medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate diagnostics and broader clinical applications.

Title: DM4CT: Benchmarking Diffusion Models for Computed Tomography Reconstruction
Authors: Jiayang Shi, Daniel M. Pelt, K. Joost Batenburg
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. While computed tomography (CT) is theoretically a linear inverse problem, it poses many practical challenges. These include correlated noise, artifact structures, reliance on system geometry, and misaligned value ranges, which make the direct application of diffusion models more difficult than in domains like natural image generation. To systematically evaluate how diffusion models perform in this context and compare them with established reconstruction methods, we introduce DM4CT, a comprehensive benchmark for CT reconstruction. DM4CT includes datasets from both medical and industrial domains with sparse-view and noisy configurations. To explore the challenges of deploying diffusion models in practice, we additionally acquire a high-resolution CT dataset at a high-energy synchrotron facility and evaluate all methods under real experimental conditions. We benchmark ten recent diffusion-based methods alongside seven strong baselines, including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available at this http URL, and the codebase is open-sourced at this http URL.

Title: An Electricity Market with Reactive Power Trading: Incorporating Dynamic Operating Envelopes
Authors: Zeinab Salehi, Elizabeth L. Ratnam, Yijun Chen, Ian R. Petersen, Guodong Shi, Duncan S. Callaway
Abstract: Electricity market design that accounts for grid constraints such as voltage and thermal limits at the distribution level can increase opportunities for the grid integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). In this paper, we consider rooftop solar backed by battery storage connected to a distribution grid. We design an electricity market to support customers sharing rooftop generation in excess of their energy demand, where customers earn a profit through peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Our proposed electricity market also incorporates P2P reactive power trading to improve the voltage profile across a distribution feeder. We formulate the electricity market as an optimization-based problem, where voltage and thermal limits across a feeder are managed through the assignment of customer-specific dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). The electricity market equilibrium is referred to as a competitive equilibrium, which is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium in a standard game. Our proposed market design is benchmarked using the IEEE 13-node test feeder.

Title: Heterogeneity-agnostic AI/ML-assisted beam selection for multi-panel arrays
Authors: Ibrahim Kilinc, Robert W. Heath Jr
Abstract: AI/ML-based beam selection methods coupled with location information effectively reduce beam training overhead. Unfortunately, heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits their feasibility and generalization. This challenge requires either a heterogeneity-agnostic model functional under these variations, or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a unifying AI/ML-based beam selection algorithm supporting antenna heterogeneity by predicting wireless propagation characteristics independent of antenna configuration. We derive a reference signal received power (RSRP) model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. We propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables consisting of angle-of-arrival (AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and a matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization from beamformed RSRP measurements. We develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining or having a separate model for each configuration. Simulation results show our heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity.

Title: Seeking Nash Equilibrium in Non-cooperative Quadratic Games Under Delayed Information Exchange
Authors: Kaichen Jiang, Yuyue Yan, Mingda Yue, Yuhu Wu
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the seeking of Nash equilibrium (NE) in a non-cooperative quadratic game where all agents exchange their delayed strategy information with their neighbors. To extend best-response algorithms to the delayed information setting, an estimation mechanism for each agent to estimate the current strategy profile is designed. Based on the best-response strategy to the estimations, the strategy profile dynamics of all agents is established, which is revealed to converge asymptotically to the NE when agents exchange multi-step-delay information via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. In the scenario where agents exchange one-step-delay information, the exponential convergence of the strategy profile dynamics to the NE can be guaranteed by restricting the learning rate to less than an upper bound. Moreover, a lower bound on the learning rate for instability of the NE is proposed. Numerical simulations are provided for verifying the developed results.

Title: Mind the Gap: Detecting Cluster Exits for Robust Local Density-Based Score Normalization in Anomalous Sound Detection
Authors: Kevin Wilkinghoff, Gordon Wichern, Jonathan Le Roux, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: Local density-based score normalization is an effective component of distance-based embedding methods for anomalous sound detection, particularly when data densities vary across conditions or domains. In practice, however, performance depends strongly on neighborhood size. Increasing it can degrade detection accuracy when neighborhood expansion crosses cluster boundaries, violating the locality assumption of local density estimation. This observation motivates adapting the neighborhood size based on locality preservation rather than fixing it in advance. We realize this by proposing cluster exit detection, a lightweight mechanism that identifies distance discontinuities and selects neighborhood sizes accordingly. Experiments across multiple embedding models and datasets show improved robustness to neighborhood-size selection and consistent performance gains.

Title: TIACam: Text-Anchored Invariant Feature Learning with Auto-Augmentation for Camera-Robust Zero-Watermarking
Authors: Abdullah All Tanvir, Agnibh Dasgupta, Xin Zhong
Abstract: Camera recapture introduces complex optical degradations, such as perspective warping, illumination shifts, and Moiré interference, that remain challenging for deep watermarking systems. We present TIACam, a text-anchored invariant feature learning framework with auto-augmentation for camera-robust zero-watermarking. The method integrates three key innovations: (1) a learnable auto-augmentor that discovers camera-like distortions through differentiable geometric, photometric, and Moiré operators; (2) a text-anchored invariant feature learner that enforces semantic consistency via cross-modal adversarial alignment between image and text; and (3) a zero-watermarking head that binds binary messages in the invariant feature space without modifying image pixels. This unified formulation jointly optimizes invariance, semantic alignment, and watermark recoverability. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world camera captures demonstrate that TIACam achieves state-of-the-art feature stability and watermark extraction accuracy, establishing a principled bridge between multimodal invariance learning and physically robust zero-watermarking.

Title: Channel-Correlation-Based Access Point Selection and Pilot Power Allocation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Rodrigo C. De Lamare, Kanapathippillai Cumanan, Hien Quoc Ngo
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic access point (AP) selection and pilot power allocation (DAPPA) framework for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, aiming to mitigate inter-user interference and improve overall spectral efficiency (SE). A hierarchical correlation-based clustering algorithm is developed to group APs according to their channel correlation, enabling each user to be associated with APs that simultaneously provide strong channel gains and low mutual correlation. This association ensures reliable connectivity, maximizes coherent combining gains, and reduces inter-user interference, while also allowing the number of AP clusters to be adjusted flexibly, without the need to reorganize the network completely. By maintaining links to low-correlated APs, the proposed scheme reduces the need for frequent channel state information (CSI) estimation and minimizes network-wide update overhead. To enhance scalability, a user-capacity constraint per AP is incorporated, preventing hardware overload and alleviating the effects of pilot reuse. Furthermore, an effective pilot power allocation strategy is introduced to boost the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) during channel training. This is formulated as a weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and solved iteratively using a quadratic transform, which enables efficient optimization while ensuring fairness and high-quality service across all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers significant SE gains, maintains performance in high-density multi-user scenarios, and converges faster than benchmark schemes.

Title: [b]=[d]-[t]+[p]: Self-supervised Speech Models Discover Phonological Vector Arithmetic
Authors: Kwanghee Choi, Eunjung Yeo, Cheol Jun Cho, David Harwath, David R. Mortensen
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) are known to encode rich phonetic information, yet how this information is structured remains underexplored. We conduct a comprehensive study across 96 languages to analyze the underlying structure of S3M representations, with particular attention to phonological vectors. We first show that there exist linear directions within the model's representation space that correspond to phonological features. We further demonstrate that the scale of these phonological vectors correlate to the degree of acoustic realization of their corresponding phonological features in a continuous manner. For example, the difference between [d] and [t] yields a voicing vector: adding this vector to [p] produces [b], while scaling it results in a continuum of voicing. Together, these findings indicate that S3Ms encode speech using phonologically interpretable and compositional vectors, demonstrating phonological vector arithmetic.

Title: A Spatial Similarity-Guided Pilot Assignment and Access Point Selection for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Kanapathippillai Cumanan, Pei Liu, Hien Quoc Ngo
Abstract: This paper investigates pilot assignment and access point (AP) selection strategies for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. We propose channel similarity-aware pilot assignment (CAPA) and AP selection schemes to improve interference management and, consequently, spectral efficiency (SE). The pilot assignment strategy dynamically allocates pilot sequences by evaluating inter-user channel similarity, ensuring that users (UEs) with high channel similarity are assigned orthogonal pilots to mitigate pilot contamination. Subsequently, an AP selection algorithm is introduced that prioritizes the selection of low-correlation APs to reduce interference and enhance spatial diversity. This selection process maintains robust UE-AP links while minimizing inter-AP redundancy. The combined approach significantly improves SE, particularly in dense network deployments. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies under dynamic UE scenarios.

Title: A Stochastic Gradient Descent Approach to Design Policy Gradient Methods for LQR
Authors: Bowen Song, Simon Weissmann, Mathias Staudigl, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework to design data-driven policy gradient descent algorithms for the linear quadratic regulator problem. Two alternative schemes are considered to estimate the policy gradient from stochastic trajectory data: (i) an indirect online identification based approach, in which the system matrices are first estimated and subsequently used to construct the gradient, and (ii) a direct zeroth-order approach, which approximates the gradient using empirical cost evaluations. In both cases, the resulting gradient estimates are random due to stochasticity in the data, allowing us to use SGD theory to analyze the convergence of the associated policy gradient methods. A key technical step consists of modeling the gradient estimates as suitable stochastic gradient oracles, which, because of the way they are computed, are inherently based. We derive sufficient conditions under which SGD with a biased gradient oracle converges asymptotically to the optimal policy, and leverage these conditions to design the parameters of the gradient estimation schemes. Moreover, we compare the advantages and limitations of the two data-driven gradient estimators. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: MDM-ASR: Bridging Accuracy and Efficiency in ASR with Diffusion-Based Non-Autoregressive Decoding
Authors: Hao Yen, Pin-Jui Ku, Ante Jukić, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi
Abstract: In sequence-to-sequence Transformer ASR, autoregressive (AR) models achieve strong accuracy but suffer from slow decoding, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models enable parallel decoding at the cost of degraded performance. We propose a principled NAR ASR framework based on Masked Diffusion Models to reduce this gap. A pre-trained speech encoder is coupled with a Transformer diffusion decoder conditioned on acoustic features and partially masked transcripts for parallel token prediction. To mitigate the training-inference mismatch, we introduce Iterative Self-Correction Training that exposes the model to its own intermediate predictions. We also design a Position-Biased Entropy-Bounded Confidence-based sampler with positional bias to further boost results. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over prior NAR models and competitive performance with strong AR baselines, while retaining parallel decoding efficiency.

Title: Unified Diagnostics for Quantifying AC Operating-Point Robustness Under Injection and Topological Uncertainties with Regime Changes
Authors: Laurenţiu Lucian Anton, Marija Ilić
Abstract: In the presence of uncertainties in load, generation, and network topology, power system planning must reflect operational conditions, while operations require situational awareness over credible uncertainty sets. Existing methods screen, analyze, embed, and propagate uncertainty in power flow and optimal power flow settings, but provide only partial insight into how physical constraints, controls, and economic interactions shape steady-state operating-point robustness. By formulating operating-point robustness as a post-solution physical response problem around a solved AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equilibrium, this paper presents a unified framework for assessing robustness under injection and topological uncertainty without re-optimization. We construct a primal physical response mapping that accounts for connectivity changes, active power redistribution, generator saturation including $PV \rightarrow PQ$ transitions, and AC network propagation, and introduce quasi-duals that provide a geometric interpretation of shadow prices for off-optimal equilibria. Using these mappings, we develop deterministic screening procedures that generalize $N-k$ contingency analysis to include cost vulnerability $C-k$, and local analogs $N+\delta(k)$ and $C+\delta(k)$ defined through sensitivity-normalized margins and risk tolerances. The framework is extended to probabilistic screening for distribution- and moment-based uncertainties, with sequentially-pruned mixture modeling and $\alpha$-stressed regime constructions to manage combinatorial branching. A case study on the Puerto Rican bulk power system demonstrates integration with geospatial data to enhance operational and planning awareness.

Title: Automated Disentangling Analysis of Skin Colour for Lesion Images
Authors: Wenbo Yang, Eman Rezk, Walaa M. Moursi, Zhou Wang
Abstract: Machine-learning models working on skin images often have degraded performance when the skin colour captured in images (SCCI) differs between training and deployment. Such differences arise from entangled environmental factors (e.g., illumination, camera settings), and intrinsic factors (e.g., skin tone) that cannot be accurately described by a single "skin tone" scalar. To mitigate such colour mismatch, we propose a skin-colour disentangling framework that adapts disentanglement-by-compression to learn a structured, manipulable latent space for SCCI from unlabelled dermatology images. To prevent information leakage that hinders proper learning of dark colour features, we introduce a randomized, mostly monotonic decolourization mapping. To suppress unintended colour shifts of localized patterns (e.g., ink marks, scars) during colour manipulation, we further propose a geometry-aligned post-processing step. Together, these components enable faithful counterfactual editing and answering an essential question: "What would this skin condition look like under a different SCCI?", as well as direct colour transfer between images and controlled traversal along physically meaningful directions (e.g., blood perfusion, camera white balance), enabling educational visualization of skin conditions under varying SCCI. We demonstrate that dataset-level augmentation and colour normalization based on our framework achieve competitive lesion classification performance.

Title: Cooperative Transportation Without Prior Object Knowledge via Adaptive Self-Allocation and Coordination
Authors: Jie Song, Yang Bai, Naoki Wakamiya
Abstract: This work proposes a novel cooperative transportation framework for multi-agent systems that does not require any prior knowledge of cargo locations or sizes. Each agent relies on local sensing to detect cargos, recruit nearby agents, and autonomously form a transportation team with an appropriate size. The core idea is that once an agent detects a cargo within its sensing range, it generates an attraction field represented by a density function, which pulls neighboring agents toward the cargo. When multiple cargos are present, the attraction fields generated by different agents are adaptively weighted and combined with Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), enabling agents to self-organize into balanced formations while automatically allocating more agents to larger cargos. To prevent agents from clustering on one side of a large cargo, a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based mechanism is introduced to enforce safe inter-agent distances and promote a uniform, symmetric distribution of agents around each cargo, which is essential for stable transportation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can simultaneously transport multiple cargos of different sizes in a coordinated and collision-free manner.

Title: Event-Triggered Gossip for Distributed Learning
Authors: Zhiyuan Zhai, Xiaojun Yuan, Wei Ni, Xin Wang, Rui Zhang, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: While distributed learning offers a new learning paradigm for distributed network with no central coordination, it is constrained by communication bottleneck between nodes. We develop a new event-triggered gossip framework for distributed learning to reduce inter-node communication overhead. The framework introduces an adaptive communication control mechanism that enables each node to autonomously decide in a fully decentralized fashion when to exchange model information with its neighbors based on local model deviations. We analyze the ergodic convergence of the proposed framework under noconvex objectives and interpret the convergence guarantees under different triggering conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves substantially lower communication overhead than the state-of-the-art distributed learning methods, reducing cumulative point-to-point transmissions by \textbf{71.61\%} with only a marginal performance loss, compared with the conventional full-communication baseline.

Title: Downlink Beamforming Design for NOMA Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Chentong Li, Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Kanapathippillai Cumanan, Octavia A. Dobre
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and beamforming are well-established techniques for enabling massive connectivity in future wireless networks. However, many optimal beamforming solutions rely on highly complex iterative algorithms and optimization methods, resulting in an increase in computational burden and latency, making them less suitable for delay-sensitive applications and services. To address these challenges, we propose an effective convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for beamforming design in downlink NOMA systems to solve the transmit power minimization problem. The proposed method utilizes two representations of channel state information as input features to produce normalized beamforming vectors. Simulation results show that the CNN-based solution closely approximates the optimal label performance while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional high-complexity algorithms, enhancing its practicality for real-time applications.

Title: CosyAccent: Duration-Controllable Accent Normalization Using Source-Synthesis Training Data
Authors: Qibing Bai, Shuhao Shi, Shuai Wang, Yukai Ju, Yannan Wang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Accent normalization (AN) systems often struggle with unnatural outputs and undesired content distortion, stemming from both suboptimal training data and rigid duration modeling. In this paper, we propose a "source-synthesis" methodology for training data construction. By generating source L2 speech and using authentic native speech as the training target, our approach avoids learning from TTS artifacts and, crucially, requires no real L2 data in training. Alongside this data strategy, we introduce CosyAccent, a non-autoregressive model that resolves the trade-off between prosodic naturalness and duration control. CosyAccent implicitly models rhythm for flexibility yet offers explicit control over total output duration. Experiments show that, despite being trained without any real L2 speech, CosyAccent achieves significantly improved content preservation and superior naturalness compared to strong baselines trained on real-world data.

Title: On the Stability of Spatially Distributed Cavity Laser and Boundary of Resonant Beam SLIPT
Authors: Mingliang Xiong, Zeqian Guo, Qingqing Zhang, Qingwen Liu, Gang Wang, Gang Li, Bin He
Abstract: Spatially distributed cavity (SDC) lasers are a promising technology for simultaneous light information and power transfer (SLIPT), offering benefits such as increased mobility and intrinsic safety, which are advantageous for various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \mll However, achieving beam transmission over meter-level long working distances presents significant challenges from cavity stability constraints, manufacturing/assembly tolerances, and diffraction losses\mrr. This paper conducts a theoretical investigation of the fundamental restrictions limiting long-range resonant beam generation. We investigate cavity stability and beam characteristics, and propose a binary-search-based Monte Carlo simulation algorithm as well as a linear approximation algorithm to quantify the maximum acceptable tolerances for stable operation. \mll Numerical results indicate that the stable region contracts sharply as distance increases. For fixed-component systems, an acceptable tolerance of 0.01 mm restricts the achievable transmission distance to less than 2 m. \mrr To address this limitation, we also prove the feasibility of long-range beam formation using precision adjustable elements, paving the way for advanced engineering applications. \mll Experimental results verified this assumption, demonstrating that by tuning the stable region during assembly, the transmission distance could be extended to 2.8 m. \mrr This work provides essential theoretical insights and practical design guidelines for realizing stable, long-range SDC systems.

Title: A data-driven model-free physical-informed deep operator network for solving nonlinear dynamic system
Authors: Jieming Sun, Lichun Li
Abstract: The existing physical-informed Deep Operator Networks are mostly based on either the well-known mathematical formula of the system or huge amounts of data for different scenarios. However, in some cases, it is difficult to get the exact mathematical formula and vast amounts of data in some dynamic systems, we can only get a few experimental data or limited mathematical information. To address the cases, we propose a data-driven model-free physical-informed Deep Operator Network (DeepOnet) framework to learn the nonlinear dynamic systems from few available data. We first explore the short-term dependence of the available data and use a surrogate machine learning model to extract the short-term dependence. Then, the surrogate machine learning model is incorporated into the DeepOnet as the physical information part. Then, the constructed DeepOnet is trained to simulate the system's dynamic response for given control inputs and initial conditions. Numerical experiments on different systems confirm that our DeepOnet framework learns to approximate the dynamic response of some nonlinear dynamic systems effectively.

Title: A Power Market Model with Hypersaclers and Modular Datacenters
Authors: Yihsu Chen, Abel Souza, Fargol Nematkhah, Andrew L. Liu
Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI has led the growth of computational demand, with large language models (LLMs) at the forefront since ChatGPT's debut in 2022. Meanwhile, large amounts of renewable energy have been deployed but, ultimately, curtailed due to transmission congestion and inadequate demand. This work develops a power market model that allows hyperscalers to spatially migrate LLM inference workloads to geo-distributed modular datacenters (MDCs), which are co-located with near renewable sources of energy at the edge of the network. We introduce the optimization problems faced by the hyperscaler and MDCs in addition to consumers, producers, and the electric grid operator, where the hyerscaler enters an agreement to lease MDCs while ensuring that the required service level objectives (SLOs) are met. The overall market model is formulated as a complementarity problem, where the proof is provided showing the existence and uniqueness of the solutions. When applying the model to an IEEE RTS-24 bus case study, we show that even with a provision that requires MDCs to disclose the CO$_2$ emissions associated with their energy supply sources, renting less polluting MDCs is unlikely to yield meaningful emission reductions due to so-called contract-reshuffling. The situation can be mitigated when conventional loads are supplied by forward contracts through power purchase agreements. This also leads to a decline in system congestion when the hyperscaler becomes increasingly cost-aware.

Title: Self-Configurable Mesh-Networks for Scalable Distributed Submodular Bandit Optimization
Authors: Zirui Xu, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: We study how to scale distributed bandit submodular coordination under realistic communication constraints in bandwidth, data rate, and connectivity. We are motivated by multi-agent tasks of active situational awareness in unknown, partially-observable, and resource-limited environments, where the agents must coordinate through agent-to-agent communication. Our approach enables scalability by (i) limiting information relays to only one-hop communication and (ii) keeping inter-agent messages small, having each agent transmit only its own action information. Despite these information-access restrictions, our approach enables near-optimal action coordination by optimizing the agents' communication neighborhoods over time, through distributed online bandit optimization, subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints. Particularly, our approach enjoys an anytime suboptimality bound that is also strictly positive for arbitrary network topologies, even disconnected. To prove the bound, we define the Value of Coordination (VoC), an information-theoretic metric that quantifies for each agent the benefit of information access to its neighbors. We validate in simulations the scalability and near-optimality of our approach: it is observed to converge faster, outperform benchmarks for bandit submodular coordination, and can even outperform benchmarks that are privileged with a priori knowledge of the environment.

Title: Decentralized Attack-Resilient CLF-Based Control of Nonlinear DC Microgrids under FDI Attacks
Authors: Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Muratkhan Abdirash, Xiaofan Cui, Shan Zuo
Abstract: The growing deployment of nonlinear, converter interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in DC microgrids demands decentralized controllers that remain stable and resilient under a wide range of cyber-physical attacks and disturbances. Traditional droop or linearized control methods lack resilience and scalability, especially when the system operates in its nonlinear region or faces diverse false-data-injection (FDI) attacks on control inputs. In this work, we develop a Decentralized Attack-Resilient Control Lyapunov Function (AR-CLF) based Quadratic Program (QP) control framework for nonlinear DC microgrids that ensures large-signal stability in a fully decentralized manner. Built upon the port-Hamiltonian representation, the proposed controller dynamically compensates diverse attacks including exponentially unbounded control-input perturbations beyond the bounded-attack regime commonly assumed in existing methods, through an adaptive resilience term, without requiring global information. Simulations validate that the AR-CLF based QP controller achieves superior stability and resilience against unbounded attacks, paving the way for scalable, attack-resilient, and physically consistent control of next-generation DC microgrids.

Title: A Reinforcement Learning-based Transmission Expansion Framework Considering Strategic Bidding in Electricity Markets
Authors: Tomonari Kanazawa, Hikaru Hoshino, Eiko Furutani
Abstract: Transmission expansion planning in electricity markets is tightly coupled with the strategic bidding behaviors of generation companies. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based co-optimization framework that simultaneously learns transmission investment decisions and generator bidding strategies within a unified training process. Based on a multiagent RL framework for market simulation, the proposed method newly introduces a design policy layer that jointly optimizes continuous/discrete transmission expansion decisions together with strategic bidding policies. Through iterative interaction between market clearing and investment design, the framework effectively captures their mutual influence and achieves consistent co-optimization of expansion and bidding decisions. Case studies on the IEEE 30-bus system are provided for proof-of-concept validation of the proposed co-optimization framework.

Title: Elevation-Aware Supplementary Uplink for Direct Satellite-to-Device Communications
Authors: Rajan Shrestha, Hayder Al-Hraishawi
Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication enables standard mobile devices to connect directly to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, providing global coverage without reliance on terrestrial infrastructure. However, the DS2D uplink is fundamentally constrained by long propagation distances, severe path loss, and stringent user equipment (UE) power limits, making uplink reliability particularly challenging at low elevation angles and beam edges. This paper investigates the integration of supplementary uplink (SUL) technology into DS2D systems to enhance uplink robustness while preserving UE power efficiency. Leveraging the predictable geometry of LEO satellite orbits, we develop an elevation-aware SUL framework that adapts uplink operation across frequency bands based on elevation-dependent link margin estimates. The proposed approach schedules the UE to transmit on either a primary uplink carrier or a lower-frequency SUL carrier. An elevation-aware SUL activation algorithm with hysteresis is introduced to guide uplink carrier selection while preventing frequent switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SUL framework extends effective uplink coverage toward low-elevation and beam-edge regions, improves uplink availability over a satellite pass, and achieves stable operation with a minimal number of uplink transitions under realistic UE power constraints.

Title: Sizing of Battery Considering Renewable Energy Bidding Strategy with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Taiyo Mantani, Hikaru Hoshino, Tomonari Kanazawa, Eiko Furutani
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel computationally efficient algorithm for optimal sizing of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) considering renewable energy bidding strategies. Unlike existing two-stage methods, our algorithm enables the cooptimization of both by updating the BESS size during the training of the bidding policy, leveraging an extended reinforcement learning (RL) framework inspired by advancements in embodied cognition. By integrating the Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) with a distributed RL framework, the proposed algorithm effectively manages uncertainties in renewable generation and market prices while enabling parallel computation for efficiently handling long-term data.

Title: A mixed Hinfty-Passivity approach for Leveraging District Heating Systems as Frequency Ancillary Service in Electric Power Systems
Authors: Xinyi Yi, Ioannis Lestas
Abstract: This paper introduces a mixed H-infinity-passivity framework that enables district heating systems (DHSs) with heat pumps to support electric-grid frequency regulation. The analysis illustrates how the DHS regulator influences coupled electro-thermal frequency dynamics and provides LMI conditions for efficient controller design. We also present a disturbance-independent temperature regulator that ensures stability and robustness against heat-demand uncertainty. Simulations demonstrate improved frequency-control dynamics in the electrical power grid while maintaining good thermal performance in the DHS.

Title: An LLM-Enabled Frequency-Aware Flow Diffusion Model for Natural-Language-Guided Power System Scenario Generation
Authors: Zhenghao Zhou, Yiyan Li, Fei Xie, Lu Wang, Bo Wang, Jiansheng Wang, Zheng Yan, Mo-Yuen Chow
Abstract: Diverse and controllable scenario generation (e.g., wind, solar, load, etc.) is critical for robust power system planning and operation. As AI-based scenario generation methods are becoming the mainstream, existing methods (e.g., Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets) mainly rely on a fixed-length numerical conditioning vector to control the generation results, facing challenges in user conveniency and generation flexibility. In this paper, a natural-language-guided scenario generation framework, named LLM-enabled Frequency-aware Flow Diffusion (LFFD), is proposed to enable users to generate desired scenarios using plain human language. First, a pretrained LLM module is introduced to convert generation requests described by unstructured natural languages into ordered semantic space. Second, instead of using standard diffusion models, a flow diffusion model employing a rectified flow matching objective is introduced to achieve efficient and high-quality scenario generation, taking the LLM output as the model input. During the model training process, a frequency-aware multi-objective optimization algorithm is introduced to mitigate the frequency-bias issue. Meanwhile, a dual-agent framework is designed to create text-scenario training sample pairs as well as to standardize semantic evaluation. Experiments based on large-scale photovoltaic and load datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Dynamic Sensor Scheduling Based on Node Partitioning of Graphs
Authors: Ryouke Ikura, Junya Hara, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic sensor scheduling method for sensor networks. In sensor network applications, we often need multiple equally-informative node subsets that are activated sequentially to make a sensor network robust against concentrated battery consumption and sensor failures. In addition, quality of these subsets changes dynamically and thus we must adapt those changes. To find those node subsets, we propose a graph node partitioning method based on sampling theory for graph signals. We aim to minimize the average reconstruction error for signals obtained at all node subsets, in contrast to conventional single subset selection. The graph node partitioning problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization based on a subspace prior of graph signals, and is solved by the proximal DC algorithm. It guarantees convergence to a critical point. To accommodate the online scenario where the signal subspace and optimal partitioning may change over time, we adaptively estimate the signal subspace from historical data and sequentially update the prior for our partitioning method. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world sensor network data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower average mean squared errors compared to alternative methods.

Title: Extracting Patterns of Chemical Information from Differential Mobility Spectrometry Measurements under Varying Conditions of Humidity and Temperature
Authors: Philipp Müller, Gary A. Eiceman, Anton Rauhameri, Anton Kontunen, Antti Roine, Niku Oksala, Antti Vehkaoja, Maiju Lepomäki
Abstract: Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS), also known as Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry, is a rapid and affordable technology for extracting information from gas phase samples containing complex volatile organic compounds, and can therefore be used for analyzing surgical smoke. One obstacle to its widespread application is the dependence of DMS measurements on humidity and, to a lesser degree, temperature, making comparison of data measured under different environmental conditions arbitrary. The commonly used solution is to regulate these environmental conditions to some predefined humidity and temperature levels. However, this approach is often unfeasible or even impossible. Therefore, in this paper we analyzed a dataset of 1,852 DMS measurements of surgical smoke evaporated from porcine adipose and muscle tissue to get an understanding of the impact of varying humidity and temperature on DMS measurements. Our analysis confirmed clear dependence of the measurements on these two factors. To overcome this challenge, we fitted regression models to raw and normalized DMS measurement data. Subsequently, these models were used for estimating DMS measurements for known tissue types based on recorded humidity and temperatures. Our test suggests that it is possible to estimate DMS measurements of surgical smoke from porcine adipose and muscle tissue under specific environmental conditions by standardizing DMS measurements separation voltage-wise and training multivariate regression models on the normalized data, which is the first step in removing the need for standardized measurement conditions.

Title: CTC-TTS: LLM-based dual-streaming text-to-speech with CTC alignment
Authors: Hanwen Liu, Saierdaer Yusuyin, Hao Huang, Zhijian Ou
Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems can generate natural speech, but most are not designed for low-latency dual-streaming synthesis. High-quality dual-streaming TTS depends on accurate text--speech alignment and well-designed training sequences that balance synthesis quality and latency. Prior work often relies on GMM-HMM based forced-alignment toolkits (e.g., MFA), which are pipeline-heavy and less flexible than neural aligners; fixed-ratio interleaving of text and speech tokens struggles to capture text--speech alignment regularities. We propose CTC-TTS, which replaces MFA with a CTC based aligner and introduces a bi-word based interleaving strategy. Two variants are designed: CTC-TTS-L (token concatenation along the sequence length) for higher quality and CTC-TTS-F (embedding stacking along the feature dimension) for lower latency. Experiments show that CTC-TTS outperforms fixed-ratio interleaving and MFA-based baselines on streaming synthesis and zero-shot tasks. Speech samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Co-Optimization of Network Topology and Variable Impedance Devices under Dynamic Line Ratings in Power Transmission Systems
Authors: Junseon Park, Hyeongon Park, Rahul K. Gupta
Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to mitigate operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. These technologies, including Network Topology Optimization (NTO), Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), and Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), enhance system flexibility and enable better utilization of existing network assets. However, as the deployment of multiple GETs grows, effective coordination among them becomes essential to fully realize their potential benefits. This paper presents a co-optimization framework that models and coordinates NTO, VID, and DLR within a unified optimization scheme to alleviate network congestion and minimize operational costs. The NTO formulation is developed using a node-breaker model, offering finer switching granularity and improved operational flexibility. The inclusion of VIDs introduces nonlinear and non-convex relationships in the optimization problem. DLR takes into account of weather conditions, primarily wind speed and ambient temperature, enabling adaptive utilization of transmission capacity. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, demonstrating its effectiveness under varying numbers and placements of impedance controllers.

Title: Active IoT User Detection in Near-Field with Location Information
Authors: Gabriel Martins de Jesus, Richard Demo Souza, Onel Luis Alcaraz López
Abstract: In this paper, we address active users detection (AUD) in near-field Internet of Things (IoT) networks by exploring prior knowledge of users' locations. We consider a scenario where users are distributed in a semi-circular area within the Rayleigh distance of a multi-antenna base station (BS). We propose the BS to use location estimates of the users to reconstruct their line-of-sight (LoS) channel components, hence assisting the AUD process. For this, the BS combines these reconstructed channels with users' pilot sequences, enhancing the correlation between received signals and active users. We formulate the location-aided AUD as a convex optimization problem, solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). {Our proposal has a higher computational complexity compared to the baseline ADMM approach where location information is not used. Moreover, the proposal requires location information of users, which can be readily informed if users are static, or inferred via established localization algorithms if they are mobile.} Simulation results compare our proposal against the baseline across varying systems parameters, such as number of users, pilot length and LoS component strength. We demonstrate that under perfect location estimation and strong LoS, our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline. Furthermore, robustness analysis shows that performance gains persist under imperfect location estimation, provided the estimation error remains within bounds determined by the system parameters.

Title: Topological Signal Processing for 3D Point Cloud Data
Authors: Tiziana Cattai, Stefania Sardellitti, Stefania Colonnese, Sergio Barbarossa
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to apply the topological signal processing (TSP) framework to the analysis of 3D Point Clouds (PCs) represented on simplicial complexes. Building on Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) theory for vector fields, we introduce higher-order Laplacian operators that enable the processing of signals over triangular meshes. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed approach allows us to characterize both color attributes, modeled as 3D vectors on nodes, and geometry, modeled as 3D vectors on the barycenter of each triangle. Then, we show as TSP tools may efficiently be used to sample, recover and filter PCs attributes treating them as edge signals. Numerical results on synthetic PCs demonstrate accurate color reconstruction with robustness to sparse data and geometry refinement in the case of noisy PC coordinates. The proposed approach provides a topology-based representation to characterize the geometry and attributes of PCs.

Title: Hardware-Accelerated Geometrical Simulation of Biological and Engineered In-Air Ultrasonic Systems
Authors: Wouter Jansen, Jan Steckel
Abstract: The deployment of in-air acoustic sensors for industrial monitoring and autonomous robotics has grown significantly, often drawing inspiration from biological echolocation. However, developing and validating these systems in existing simulation frameworks remains challenging due to the computational cost of simulating high-frequency wave propagation in large, dynamic, and complex environments. While wave-based methods offer high accuracy, they scale poorly with frequency and volume. Conversely, existing geometric acoustic solvers often lack support for dynamic scenes, complex diffraction, or closed-loop robotic integration. In this work, we introduce SonoTraceUE, a high-fidelity acoustic simulation framework built as a plugin for Unreal Engine. By using a hardware-accelerated ray tracing-based specular reflection model, and a curvature-based Monte Carlo diffraction model, the system enables near real-time simulation of active and passive acoustic sensing in dynamic, multi-material environments. We validate the framework through two distinct experimental domains: a bioacoustic study and a robotics experiment. Our results demonstrate that SonoTraceUE achieves high correlation with real-world spectral and spatial data. The framework provides a versatile platform for synthetic data generation, hypothesis testing in bioacoustics, and the rapid prototyping of closed-loop robotic systems that use acoustic sensing.

Title: Multicellular Feedback Control Strategies in Synthetic Microbial Consortia: From Embedded to Distributed Control
Authors: Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: Living organisms rely on endogenous feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in the presence of uncertainty and environmental fluctuations. An emerging challenge at the interface of control systems engineering and synthetic biology is the design of reliable feedback strategies to regulate cellular behavior and collective biological functions. In this article, we review recent advances in multicellular feedback control, where sensing, computation, and actuation are distributed across different cell populations within synthetic microbial consortia, giving rise to biological multiagent control systems governed by molecular communication. From a control-theoretic perspective, these consortia can be interpreted as distributed biomolecular control systems, where coordination among populations replace embedded regulation. We survey theoretical frameworks, control architectures, and modeling approaches, ranging from aggregate population-level dynamics to spatially aware agent-based simulations, and discuss experimental demonstrations in engineered \textit{Escherichia coli} consortia. We highlight how distributing control functions across populations can reduce metabolic burden, mitigate retroactivity, improve robustness to uncertainty, and enable modular reuse of control components. Beyond regulation of gene expression, we discuss the emerging problem of population composition control, where coordination among growing and competing cell populations becomes an integral part of the control objective. Finally, we outline key open challenges that must be addressed before multicellular control strategies can be deployed in real-world applications such as biomanufacturing, environmental remediation, and therapeutic systems. These challenges span modeling and simulation, experimental platform development, coordination and composition control, and long-term evolutionary stability.

Title: Impact of Training Dataset Size for ML Load Flow Surrogates
Authors: Timon Conrad, Changhun Kim, Johann Jäger, Andreas Maier, Siming Bayer
Abstract: Efficient and accurate load flow calculations are a bedrock of modern power system operation. Classical numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson algorithm provide highly precise results but are computationally demanding, which limits their applicability in large-scale scenario studies and optimization in time-critical contexts. Research has shown that machine learning approaches can approximate load flow results with high accuracy while substantially reducing computation time. Sample efficiency, i.e., the ability to achieve high accuracy with limited training dataset size, is still insufficiently researched, especially in grids with a fixed topology. This paper presents a systematic investigation of the sample efficiency of a Multilayer Perceptron and two Graph Neural Network variants on a dataset based on a modified IEEE 5-bus system. The results for this grid size show that Graph Neural Networks achieve the lowest losses. However, the availability of large training datasets remains the dominant factor influencing performance compared to architecture choice.

Title: High-Altitude Platforms in the Low-Altitude Economy: Bridging Communication, Computing, and Regulation
Authors: Bang Huang, Eddine Youcef Belmekki, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: The Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a new technological and industrial frontier, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and aerial swarms increasingly deployed in logistics, infrastructure inspection, security, and emergency response. However, the large-scale development of the LAE demands a reliable aerial foundation that ensures not only real-time connectivity and computational support, but also navigation integrity and safe airspace management for safety-critical operations. High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), positioned at around 20 km, provide a unique balance between wide-area coverage and low-latency responsiveness. Compared with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, HAPs are closer to end users and thus capable of delivering millisecond-level connectivity, fine-grained regulatory oversight, and powerful onboard computing and caching resources. Beyond connectivity and computation, HAPs-assisted sensing and regulation further enable navigation integrity and airspace trust, which are essential for safety-critical UAV and eVTOL operations in the LAE. This article proposes a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for HAPs in the LAE: from serving as aerial infrastructure bases, to becoming super back-ends for UAV, to acting as frontline support for ground users, further enabling swarm-scale UAV coordination, and ultimately advancing toward edge-air-cloud closed-loop autonomy. In parallel, HAPs complement LEO satellites and cloud infrastructures to form a global-regional-local three-tier architecture. Looking forward, HAPs are expected to evolve from simple platforms into intelligent hubs, emerging as pivotal nodes for air traffic management, intelligent logistics, and emergency response. By doing so, they will accelerate the transition of the LAE toward large-scale deployment, autonomy, and sustainable growth.

Title: DTT-BSR: GAN-based DTTNet with RoPE Transformer Enhancement for Music Source Restoration
Authors: Shihong Tan, Haoyu Wang, Youran Ni, Yingzhao Hou, Jiayue Luo, Zipei Hu, Han Dou, Zerui Han, Ningning Pan, Yuzhu Wang, Gongping Huang
Abstract: Music source restoration (MSR) aims to recover unprocessed stems from mixed and mastered recordings. The challenge lies in both separating overlapping sources and reconstructing signals degraded by production effects such as compression and reverberation. We therefore propose DTT-BSR, a hybrid generative adversarial network (GAN) combining rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) transformer for long-term temporal modeling with dual-path band-split recurrent neural network (RNN) for multi-resolution spectral processing. Our model achieved 3rd place on the objective leaderboard and 4th place on the subjective leaderboard on the ICASSP 2026 MSR Challenge, demonstrating exceptional generation fidelity and semantic alignment with a compact size of 7.1M parameters.

Title: Rendezvous and Docking of Mobile Ground Robots for Efficient Transportation Systems
Authors: Lars Fischer, Daniel Flögel, Sören Hohmann
Abstract: In-Motion physical coupling of multiple mobile ground robots has the potential to enable new applications like in-motion transfer that improves efficiency in handling and transferring goods, which tackles current challenges in logistics. A key challenge lies in achieving reliable autonomous in-motion physical coupling of two mobile ground robots starting at any initial position. Existing approaches neglect the modeling of the docking interface and the strategy for approaching it, resulting in uncontrolled collisions that make in-motion physical coupling either impossible or inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose a central mpc approach that explicitly models the dynamics and states of two omnidirectional wheeled robots, incorporates constraints related to their docking interface, and implements an approaching strategy for rendezvous and docking. This novel approach enables omnidirectional wheeled robots with a docking interface to physically couple in motion regardless of their initial position. In addition, it makes in-motion transfer possible, which is 19.75% more time- and 21.04% energy-efficient compared to a non-coupling approach in a logistic scenario.

Title: A Stochastic Tube-Based MPC Framework with Hard Input Constraints
Authors: Carlo Karam, Matteo Tacchi, Mirko Fiacchini
Abstract: This work presents a stochastic tube-based model predictive control framework that guarantees hard input constraint satisfaction for linear systems subject to unbounded additive disturbances. The approach relies on a structured design of probabilistic reachable sets that explicitly incorporates actuator saturation into the error dynamics and bounds the resulting nonlinearity within a convex embedding. The proposed controller retains the computational efficiency and structural advantages of stochastic tube-based approaches while ensuring state chance constraint satisfaction alongside hard input limits. Recursive feasibility and mean-square stability are established for our scheme, and a numerical example illustrates its effectiveness.

Title: Breaking the CP Limit: Robust Long-Range OFDM Sensing via Interference Cleaning
Authors: Umut Utku Erdem, Lucas Giroto, Benedikt Geiger, Taewon Jeong, Silvio Mandelli, Christian Karle, Benjamin Nuss, Laurent Schmalen, Thomas Zwick
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based radar and integrated sensing and communication systems, the sensing range is traditionally limited by the round-trip time corresponding to the cyclic prefix duration. Targets whose echoes arrive after this duration induce intersymbol interference (ISI) and associated intercarrier interference (ICI), which significantly degrade detection performance, elevate the interference-noise floor in the radar image, and reduce the useful signal power due to window mismatch. Existing methods face a trade-off between recovering useful signal and suppressing interference, particularly in multi-target scenarios. This paper proposes two frameworks to resolve this dilemma, offering a flexible trade-off between computational cost and target detection performance. First, a signal model is derived, demonstrating that ISI and ICI-oriented interference often dominates thermal noise in high-dynamic-range scenarios. To combat the ISI and ICI-based interference-noise floor increase, joint-interference cancellation with coherent compensation is proposed. This approach is an efficient evolution of the successive-interference cancellation algorithm, utilizing high-precision chirp Z-transform estimation and frequency-domain coherent compensation to recover weak distant targets. For scenarios requiring maximum precision, the full reconstruction-based sliding window scheme is presented, which shifts the receive window to capture optimal signal energy while performing full-signal reconstruction for all detected targets. Numerical results show that both methods outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Title: Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Semantic Segmentation for Pulmonary Embolism Detection in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) Images
Authors: Wen-Liang Lin, Yun-Chien Cheng
Abstract: While deep learning has demonstrated considerable promise in computer-aided diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE), practical deployment in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is often hindered by "domain shift" and the prohibitive cost of expert annotations. To address these challenges, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework is proposed, utilizing a Transformer backbone and a Mean-Teacher architecture for cross-center semantic segmentation. The primary focus is placed on enhancing pseudo-label reliability by learning deep structural information within the feature space. Specifically, three modules are integrated and designed for this task: (1) a Prototype Alignment (PA) mechanism to reduce category-level distribution discrepancies; (2) Global and Local Contrastive Learning (GLCL) to capture both pixel-level topological relationships and global semantic representations; and (3) an Attention-based Auxiliary Local Prediction (AALP) module designed to reinforce sensitivity to small PE lesions by automatically extracting high-information slices from Transformer attention maps. Experimental validation conducted on cross-center datasets (FUMPE and CAD-PE) demonstrates significant performance gains. In the FUMPE -> CAD-PE task, the IoU increased from 0.1152 to 0.4153, while the CAD-PE -> FUMPE task saw an improvement from 0.1705 to 0.4302. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a 69.9% Dice score in the CT -> MRI cross-modality task on the MMWHS dataset without utilizing any target-domain labels for model selection, confirming its robustness and generalizability for diverse clinical environments.

Title: Rethinking Chronological Causal Discovery with Signal Processing
Authors: Kurt Butler, Damian Machlanski, Panagiotis Dimitrakopoulos, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris
Abstract: Causal discovery problems use a set of observations to deduce causality between variables in the real world, typically to answer questions about biological or physical systems. These observations are often recorded at regular time intervals, determined by a user or a machine, depending on the experiment design. There is generally no guarantee that the timing of these recordings matches the timing of the underlying biological or physical events. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of causal discovery methods to this potential mismatch. We consider empirical and theoretical evidence to understand how causal discovery performance is impacted by changes of sampling rate and window length. We demonstrate that both classical and recent causal discovery methods exhibit sensitivity to these hyperparameters, and we discuss how ideas from signal processing may help us understand these phenomena.

Title: Edge-based Synchronization over Signed Digraphs with Multiple Leaders
Authors: Pelin Sekercioglu, Angela Fontan, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: We address the edge-based synchronization problem in first-order multi-agent systems containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions with one or multiple leader groups. The presence of multiple leaders and antagonistic interactions means that the multi-agent typically does not achieve consensus, unless specific conditions (on the number of leaders and on the signed graph) are met, in which case the agents reach a trivial form of consensus. In general, we show that the multi-agent system exhibits a more general form of synchronization, including bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices. In particular, in this work, we present new spectral properties of signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues and establish global exponential stability of the synchronization errors. Moreover, we compute the equilibrium to which all edge states converge. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Title: From High-Level Requirements to KPIs: Conformal Signal Temporal Logic Learning for Wireless Communications
Authors: Jiechen Chen, Michele Polese, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Softwarized radio access networks (RANs), such as those based on the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture, generate rich streams of key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be leveraged to extract actionable intelligence for network optimization. However, bridging the gap between low-level KPI measurements and high-level requirements, such as quality of experience (QoE), requires methods that are both relevant, capturing temporal patterns predictive of user-level outcomes, and interpretable, providing human-readable insights that operators can validate and act upon. This paper introduces conformal signal temporal logic learning (C-STLL), a framework that addresses both requirements. C-STLL leverages signal temporal logic (STL), a formal language for specifying temporal properties of time series, to learn interpretable formulas that distinguish KPI traces satisfying high-level requirements from those that do not. To ensure reliability, C-STLL wraps around existing STL learning algorithms with a conformal calibration procedure based on the Learn Then Test (LTT) framework. This procedure produces a set of STL formulas with formal guarantees: with high probability, the set contains at least one formula achieving a user-specified accuracy level. The calibration jointly optimizes for reliability, formula complexity, and diversity through principled acceptance and stopping rules validated via multiple hypothesis testing. Experiments using the ns-3 network simulator on a mobile gaming scenario demonstrate that C-STLL effectively controls risk below target levels while returning compact, diverse sets of interpretable temporal specifications that relate KPI behavior to QoE outcomes.

Title: Digital Twin--Driven Adaptive Wavelet Strategy for Efficient 6G Backbone Network Telemetry
Authors: Alexandre Barbosa de Lima, Xavier Hesselbach, José Roberto de Almeida Amazonas
Abstract: Classical orthogonal wavelets guarantee perfect reconstruction but rely on fixed bases optimized for polynomial smoothness, achieving suboptimal compression on signals with fractal spectral signatures. Conversely, learned methods offer adaptivity but typically enforce orthogonality via soft penalties, sacrificing structural guarantees. This work establishes a rigorous equivalence between Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) tensor networks and paraunitary filter banks. The resulting framework learns adaptive wavelets while enforcing exact orthogonality through manifold-constrained optimization, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction and energy conservation throughout training. Validation on Long-Range Dependent (LRD) network traffic demonstrates that learned filters outperform classical wavelets by 0.5--3.8~dB PSNR on six MAWI backbone traces (2020--2025, 314~Mbps--1.75~Gbps) while preserving the Hurst exponent within estimation uncertainty ($|\Delta H| \le 0.03$). These results establish MERA-inspired wavelets as a principled approach for telemetry compression in 6G digital twin synchronization.

Title: On the Spatial Consistency of Sub-Terahertz Channel Characteristics for Beyond-6G Systems
Authors: Hossein Amininasab, Huda Farooqui, Dmitri Moltchanov, Sergey Andreev, Michele Polese, Mikko Valkama, Josep M. Jornet
Abstract: Ray tracing is a versatile approach for precise sub-terahertz (sub-THz, 100-300 GHz) channel modeling when designing new mechanisms for beyond-6G cellular systems. Theoretically, wireless channels may exhibit variations over wavelength distances. In the sub-THz band, close-to-millimeter wavelengths thus require extremely large computational efforts for ray-tracing modeling. However, in practice, channel characteristics may remain quantitatively similar over much larger distances, which can drastically decrease computational efforts. The aim of this study is to experimentally characterize the degree of spatial consistency in sub-THz channel characteristics. To this end, we performed a large-scale measurement campaign in the 140-150 GHz frequency band in an indoor-hall (InH) environment and characterized the channel at separation distances from 2.5 mm up to 1 m. Our results show that channel characteristics including delay spread, angular delay spread, and K-factor change only slightly over multiple tens of centimeter distances. This implies that, in the considered InH environment, the mesh grid can be in the range of 10-50 wavelengths (at 145 GHz) along stable line-of-sight (LoS) directions, while a finer resolution is needed in regions not dominated by LoS. For coarser grids, advanced interpolation is required to capture rapidly varying scattered components.

Title: Dual Security for MIMO-OFDM ISAC Systems: Artificial Ghosts or Artificial Noise
Authors: Yinchao Yang, Prabhat Raj Gautam, Yathreb Bouazizi, Michael Breza, Julie McCann
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables the efficient sharing of wireless resources to support emerging applications, but it also gives rise to new sensing-based security vulnerabilities. Here, potential communication security threats whereby confidential messages intended for legitimate users are intercepted, but also unauthorized receivers (Eves) can passively exploit target echoes to infer sensing parameters without users being aware. Despite these risks, the joint protection of sensing and communication security in ISAC systems remains unexplored. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-layer dual-secure ISAC framework that simultaneously protects sensing and communication against passive sensing Eves and communication Eves, without requiring their channel state information (CSI). Specifically, transmit beamformers are jointly designed to inject artificial noise (AN) to introduce interference to communication Eves, while deliberately distorting the reference signal available to sensing Eves to impair their sensing capability. Furthermore, the proposed design generates artificial ghosts (AGs) with fake angle-range-velocity profiles observable by all receivers. Legitimate receivers can suppress these AGs, whereas sensing Eves cannot, thereby significantly reducing their probability of correctly detecting the true targets. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively enhances both communication and sensing security, while preserving the performance of communication users and legitimate sensing receivers.

Title: Robust Taylor-Lagrange Control for Safety-Critical Systems
Authors: Wei Xiao, Christos Cassandras, Anni Li
Abstract: Solving safety-critical control problem has widely adopted the Control Barrier Function (CBF) method. However, the existence of a CBF is only a sufficient condition for system safety. The recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method addresses this limitation, but is vulnerable to the feasibility preservation problem (e.g., inter-sampling effect). In this paper, we propose a robust TLC (rTLC) method to address the feasibility preservation problem. Specifically, the rTLC method expands the safety function at an order higher than the relative degree of the function using Taylor's expansion with Lagrange remainder, which allows the control to explicitly show up at the current time instead of the future time in the TLC method. The rTLC method naturally addresses the feasibility preservation problem with only one hyper-parameter (the discretization time interval size during implementation), which is much less than its counterparts. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rTLC method through an adaptive cruise control problem, and compare it with existing safety-critical control methods.

Authors: Anders Hansson, João Victor Galvão da Mata, Martin S. Andersen
Abstract: In this paper, we show how informativity and identifiability for networks of dynamical systems can be investigated using Gröbner bases. We provide a sufficient condition for informativity in terms of positive definiteness of the spectrum of external signals and full generic rank of the transfer function relating the external signals to the inputs of the predictor. Moreover, we show how generic local network identifiability can be investigated by computing the dimension of the fiber associated with the closed loop transfer function from external measurable signals to the measured outputs.

Abstract: We present AgentOptics, an agentic AI framework for high-fidelity, autonomous optical system control built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentOptics interprets natural language tasks and executes protocol-compliant actions on heterogeneous optical devices through a structured tool abstraction layer. We implement 64 standardized MCP tools across 8 representative optical devices and construct a 410-task benchmark to evaluate request understanding, role-aware responses, multi-step coordination, robustness to linguistic variation, and error handling. We assess two deployment configurations--commercial online LLMs and locally hosted open-source LLMs--and compare them with LLM-based code generation baselines. AgentOptics achieves 87.7%--99.0% average task success rates, significantly outperforming code-generation approaches, which reach up to 50% success. We further demonstrate broader applicability through five case studies extending beyond device-level control to system orchestration, monitoring, and closed-loop optimization. These include DWDM link provisioning and coordinated monitoring of coherent 400 GbE and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) channels; autonomous characterization and bias optimization of a wideband ARoF link carrying 5G fronthaul traffic; multi-span channel provisioning with launch power optimization; closed-loop fiber polarization stabilization; and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)-based fiber monitoring with LLM-assisted event detection. These results establish AgentOptics as a scalable, robust paradigm for autonomous control and orchestration of heterogeneous optical systems.

Title: RA-QA: Towards Respiratory Audio-based Health Question Answering
Authors: Gaia A. Bertolino, Yuwei Zhang, Tong Xia, Domenico Talia, Cecilia Mascolo
Abstract: Respiratory diseases are a leading cause of death globally, highlighting the urgent need for early and accessible screening methods. While some lung auscultation analysis has been automated and machine learning audio based models are able to predict respiratory pathologies, there remains a critical gap: the lack of intelligent systems that can interact in real-time consultations using natural language. Unlike other clinical domains, such as electronic health records, radiological images, and biosignals, where numerous question-answering (QA) datasets and models have been established, audio-based modalities remain notably underdeveloped. We curated and harmonized data from 11 diverse respiratory audio datasets to construct the first Respiratory Audio Question Answering (RA-QA) dataset. As the first multimodal QA resource of its kind focused specifically on respiratory health, RA-QA bridges clinical audio and natural language in a structured, scalable format. This new data resource contains about 7.5 million QA pairs spanning more than 60 attributes and three question types: single verification, multiple choice, and open-ended questions. Building upon this dataset, we introduce a novel benchmark that compares audio-text generation models with traditional audio classifiers to evaluate their respective performance.\\Our experiments reveal interesting performance variations across different attributes and question types, establishing a baseline and paving the way for more advanced architectures that could further improve the performance. By bridging machine learning with real-world clinical dialogue, our work opens the door to the development of more interactive, intelligent, and accessible diagnostic tools in respiratory healthcare.

Title: Support Vector Data Description for Radar Target Detection
Authors: Jean Pinsolle, Yadang Alexis Rouzoumka, Chengfang Ren, Chistèle Morisseau, Jean-Philippe Ovarlez
Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.

Title: DCInject: Persistent Backdoor Attacks via Frequency Manipulation in Personal Federated Learning
Authors: Nahom Birhan, Daniel Wesego, Dereje Shenkut, Frank Liu, Daniel Takabi
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) creates client-specific models to handle data heterogeneity. Previously, PFL has been shown to be naturally resistant to backdoor attack propagation across clients. In this work, we reveal that PFL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks through a novel frequency-domain approach. We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

Title: Design and Biomechanical Evaluation of a Lightweight Low-Complexity Soft Bilateral Ankle Exoskeleton
Authors: Josée Mallah, Zakii Javed, Zafer Azak, Thomas Stone, Luigi G. Occhipinti
Abstract: Many people could benefit from exoskeleton assistance during gait, for either medical or nonmedical purposes. But exoskeletons bring added mass and structure, which in turn require compensating for. In this work, we present a lightweight, low-complexity, soft bilateral ankle exoskeleton for plantarflexion assistance, with a shoe attachment design that can be mounted on top of any pair of shoes. Experimental tests show no significant difference in lower limb kinematics and kinetics when wearing the exoskeleton in zero-torque mode relative to not wearing an exoskeleton, showing that our device does not obstruct healthy gait, and proving it as a compliant and comfortable device, promising to provide effective assistance. Hence, a control system was developed, and additional tests are underway.

Title: Infinite-Dimensional Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics for Soft Robots via Neural Operators
Authors: Carina Veil, Moritz Flaschel, Ellen Kuhl, Cosimo Della Santina
Abstract: While kinematic inversion is a purely geometric problem for fully actuated rigid robots, it becomes extremely challenging for underactuated soft robots with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) schemes address this by introducing end-to-end mappings from actuation to task space for the controller to operate on, but typically assume finite dimensions of the underlying virtual configuration space. In this work, we extend CLIK to the infinite-dimensional domain to reason about the entire soft robot shape while solving tasks. We do this by composing an actuation-to-shape map with a shape-to-task map, deriving the differential end-to-end kinematics via an infinite-dimensional chain rule, and thereby obtaining a Jacobian-based CLIK algorithm. Since the actuation-to-shape mapping is rarely available in closed form, we propose to learn it from simulation data using neural operator networks, which are differentiable. We first present an analytical study on a constant-curvature segment, and then apply the neural version of the algorithm to a three-fiber soft robotic arm whose underlying model relies on morphoelasticity and active filament theory. This opens new possibilities for differentiable control of soft robots by exploiting full-body shape information in a continuous, infinite-dimensional framework.

Title: ReHear: Iterative Pseudo-Label Refinement for Semi-Supervised Speech Recognition via Audio Large Language Models
Authors: Zefang Liu, Chenyang Zhu, Sangwoo Cho, Shi-Xiong Zhang
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning in automatic speech recognition (ASR) typically relies on pseudo-labeling, which often suffers from confirmation bias and error accumulation due to noisy supervision. To address this limitation, we propose ReHear, a framework for iterative pseudo-label refinement that integrates an instruction-tuned, audio-aware large language model (LLM) into the self-training loop. Unlike conventional text-based correctors, our approach conditions the LLM on both the ASR hypothesis and the source audio, allowing it to recover phonetically accurate transcripts even from severe recognition errors. These refined pseudo-labels serve as high-fidelity targets for fine-tuning the ASR model in an iterative cycle. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ReHear effectively mitigates error propagation, consistently outperforming both supervised and pseudo-labeling baselines.

Title: HONEST-CAV: Hierarchical Optimization of Network Signals and Trajectories for Connected and Automated Vehicles with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ziyan Zhang, Changxin Wan, Peng Hao, Kanok Boriboonsomsin, Matthew J. Barth, Yongkang Liu, Seyhan Ucar, Guoyuan Wu
Abstract: This study presents a hierarchical, network-level traffic flow control framework for mixed traffic consisting of Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification.

Title: RotorSuite: A MATLAB/Simulink Toolbox for Tilt Multi-Rotor UAV Modeling
Authors: Nicola Cigarini, Giulia Michieletto, Angelo Cenedese
Abstract: In recent years, aerial platforms have evolved from passive flying sensors into versatile, contact-aware robotic systems, leading to rapid advances in platform design. Standard coplanar and collinear quadrotors have been complemented by modern tilted and tilting multi-rotor platforms with enhanced maneuverability. To properly analyze, control, and validate the performance of these emerging platforms, an accurate modeling step is required; however, this can be time-consuming, user-dependent and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox for modeling and simulating the dynamics of a broad class of multi-rotor platforms through both an analytical and physics-based approaches. The toolbox, named RotorSuite, is provided with comprehensive documentation and example use cases, representing a valuable tool for didactic, research, and industrial development purposes.

Title: Depth-Enhanced YOLO-SAM2 Detection for Reliable Ballast Insufficiency Identification
Authors: Shiyu Liu, Dylan Lester, Husnu Narman, Ammar Alzarrad, Pingping Zhu
Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification. Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.

Title: Face Presentation Attack Detection via Content-Adaptive Spatial Operators
Authors: Shujaat Khan
Abstract: Face presentation attack detection (FacePAD) is critical for securing facial authentication against print, replay, and mask-based spoofing. This paper proposes CASO-PAD, an RGB-only, single-frame model that enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution) to better capture localized spoof cues. Unlike spatially shared convolution kernels, the proposed operator generates location-specific, channel-shared kernels conditioned on the input, improving spatial selectivity with minimal overhead. CASO-PAD remains lightweight (3.6M parameters; 0.64 GFLOPs at $256\times256$) and is trained end-to-end using a standard binary cross-entropy objective. Extensive experiments on Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile, ROSE-Youtu, and OULU-NPU demonstrate strong performance, achieving 100/100/98.9/99.7\% test accuracy, AUC of 1.00/1.00/0.9995/0.9999, and HTER of 0.00/0.00/0.82/0.44\%, respectively. On the large-scale SiW-Mv2 Protocol-1 benchmark, CASO-PAD further attains 95.45\% accuracy with 3.11\% HTER and 3.13\% EER, indicating improved robustness under diverse real-world attacks. Ablation studies show that placing the adaptive operator near the network head and using moderate group sharing yields the best accuracy--efficiency balance. Overall, CASO-PAD provides a practical pathway for robust, on-device FacePAD with mobile-class compute and without auxiliary sensors or temporal stacks.

Title: Distributed and Consistent Multi-Robot Visual-Inertial-Ranging Odometry on Lie Groups
Authors: Ziwei Kang, Yizhi Zhou
Abstract: Reliable localization is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) provides lightweight and accurate motion estimation but suffers from cumulative drift in the absence of global references. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging offers complementary global observations, yet most existing UWB-aided VIO methods are designed for single-robot scenarios and rely on pre-calibrated anchors, which limits their robustness in practice. This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints. By leveraging a right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups, the proposed approach preserves the observability properties of standard VIO, ensuring estimator consistency. Simulation results with multiple robots demonstrate that DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness, while simultaneously enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings.

Title: Distributional Stability of Tangent-Linearized Gaussian Inference on Smooth Manifolds
Authors: Junghoon Seo, Hakjin Lee, Jaehoon Sim
Abstract: Gaussian inference on smooth manifolds is central to robotics, but exact marginalization and conditioning are generally non-Gaussian and geometry-dependent. We study tangent-linearized Gaussian inference and derive explicit non-asymptotic $W_2$ stability bounds for projection marginalization and surface-measure conditioning. The bounds separate local second-order geometric distortion from nonlocal tail leakage and, for Gaussian inputs, yield closed-form diagnostics from $(\mu,\Sigma)$ and curvature/reach surrogates. Circle and planar-pushing experiments validate the predicted calibration transition near $\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_{\mathrm{op}}}/R\approx 1/6$ and indicate that normal-direction uncertainty is the dominant failure mode when locality breaks. These diagnostics provide practical triggers for switching from single-chart linearization to multi-chart or sample-based manifold inference.

Title: Shift-invariant spaces on finite undirected graphs
Authors: Yang Chen, Seok-Young Chung, Qiyu Sun
Abstract: Shift-invariant spaces (SISs) on the real line provide a natural framework for representing, analyzing and processing signals with inherent shift-invariant structure. In this paper, we extend this framework to the finite undirected graph setting by introducing the concept of graph shift-invariant spaces (GSISs). We examine several properties of GSISs, including their characterization via range functions and fiber functions in the Fourier domain, their connections to shift-invariant filters and polynomial filters, the frame and Riesz basis structures of finitely generated GSISs, and their intricate relationships with bandlimited spaces, finitely generated GSISs, and graph reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with shift-invariant reproducing kernels (SIGRKHSs). Our analysis reveals several distinctions between SISs on the line and GSISs, such as the shift-invariance of the frame operator, the existence of shift-invariant dual frames, the emergence of fractional shift-invariance, and the interrelationships among GSISs, finitely generated GSISs, SIGRKHSs and bandlimited spaces. In this paper, we also introduce a spectral decomposition of the identity associated with graph shifts and propose a novel definition of the graph Fourier transform (GFT) of spectral type, together with explicit formulations for the GFTs on complete graphs and circulant graphs. In addition, we establish a clear connection between polynomial filters and shift-invariant filters, and we derive a graph uncertainty principle governing the essential supports of a nonzero graph signal and its GFT.

Title: CORVET: A CORDIC-Powered, Resource-Frugal Mixed-Precision Vector Processing Engine for High-Throughput AIoT applications
Authors: Sonu Kumar, Mohd Faisal Khan, Mukul Lokhande, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma
Abstract: This brief presents a runtime-adaptive, performance-enhanced vector engine featuring a low-resource, iterative CORDIC-based MAC unit for edge AI acceleration. The proposed design enables dynamic reconfiguration between approximate and accurate modes, exploiting the latency-accuracy trade-off for a wide range of workloads. Its resource-efficient approach further enables up to 4x throughput improvement within the same hardware resources by leveraging vectorised, time-multiplexed execution and flexible precision scaling. With a time-multiplexed multi-AF block and a lightweight pooling and normalisation unit, the proposed vector engine supports flexible precision (4/8/16-bit) and high MAC density. The ASIC implementation results show that each MAC stage can save up to 33% of time and 21% of power, with a 256-PE configuration that achieves higher compute density (4.83 TOPS/mm2 ) and energy efficiency (11.67 TOPS/W) than previous state-of-the-art work. A detailed hardware-software co-design methodology for object detection and classification tasks on Pynq-Z2 is discussed to assess the proposed architecture, demonstrating a scalable, energy-efficient solution for edge AI applications.

Title: Strategic Gaussian Signaling under Linear Sensitivity Mismatch
Authors: Hassan Mohamad, Vineeth Satheeskumar Varma, Samson Lasaulce
Abstract: This paper analyzes Stackelberg Gaussian signaling games under linear sensitivity mismatch, generalizing standard additive and constant-bias models. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibrium structure for both noiseless and noisy signaling regimes. In the noiseless case, we show that the encoder selectively reveals information along specific eigenspaces of a cost-mismatch matrix. We then extend the analysis to the noisy regime and derive analytical thresholds for the existence of informative equilibria, demonstrating a sharp phase transition where communication collapses into silence if the sensitivity mismatch is sufficiently high, in contrast with the fully revealing equilibria often found in constant-bias models.

Title: Metasurfaces-Integrated Wireless Neural Networks for Lightweight Over-The-Air Edge Inference
Authors: Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, Mario Edoardo Pandolfo, Paolo Di Lorenzo, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: The upcoming sixth Generation (6G) of wireless networks envisions ultra-low latency and energy efficient Edge Inference (EI) for diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, traditional digital hardware for machine learning is power intensive, motivating the need for alternative computation paradigms. Over-The-Air (OTA) computation is regarded as an emerging transformative approach assigning the wireless channel to actively perform computational tasks. This article introduces the concept of Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Networks (MINNs), a physical-layer-enabled deep learning framework that leverages programmable multi-layer metasurface structures and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels to realize computational layers in the wave propagation domain. The MINN system is conceptualized as three modules: Encoder, Channel (uncontrollable propagation features and metasurfaces), and Decoder. The first and last modules, realized respectively at the multi-antenna transmitter and receiver, consist of conventional digital or purposely designed analog Deep Neural Network (DNN) layers, and the metasurfaces responses of the Channel module are optimized alongside all modules as trainable weights. This architecture enables computation offloading into the end-to-end physical layer, flexibly among its constituent modules, achieving performance comparable to fully digital DNNs while significantly reducing power consumption. The training of the MINN framework, two representative variations, and performance results for indicative applications are presented, highlighting the potential of MINNs as a lightweight and sustainable solution for future EI-enabled wireless systems. The article is concluded with a list of open challenges and promising research directions.

Title: Where Should Robotaxis Operate? Strategic Network Design for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand
Authors: Xinling Li, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: The emergence of Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) services creates new opportunities to improve the efficiency and reliability of on-demand mobility systems. Unlike human-driven Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), AMoD enables fully centralized fleet control, but it also requires appropriate infrastructure, so that vehicles can operate safely only on a suitably instrumented subnetwork of the roads. Most existing AMoD research focuses on fleet control (matching, rebalancing, ridepooling) on a fixed road network and does not address the joint design of the service network and fleet capacity. In this paper, we formalize this strategic design problem as the Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Network Design Problem (AMoD-NDP), in which an operator selects an operation subnetwork and routes all passengers, subject to infrastructure and fleet constraints and route-level quality-of-service requirements. We propose a path-based mixed-integer formulation of the AMoD-NDP and develop a column-generation-based algorithm that scales to city-sized networks. The master problem optimizes over a restricted set of paths, while the pricing problem reduces to an elementary shortest path with resource constraints, solved exactly by a tailored label-correcting algorithm. The method provides an explicit certificate of the optimality gap and extends naturally to a robust counterpart under box uncertainty in travel times and demand. Using real-world data from Manhattan, New York City, we show that the framework produces stable and interpretable operation subnetworks, quantifies trade-offs between infrastructure investment and fleet time, and accommodates additional path-level constraints, such as limits on left turns as a proxy for operational risk. These results illustrate how the proposed approach can support strategic planning and policy analysis for future AMoD deployments.

Title: Design and Control of Modular Magnetic Millirobots for Multimodal Locomotion and Shape Reconfiguration
Authors: Erik Garcia Oyono, Jialin Lin, Dandan Zhang
Abstract: Modular small-scale robots offer the potential for on-demand assembly and disassembly, enabling task-specific adaptation in dynamic and constrained environments. However, existing modular magnetic platforms often depend on workspace collisions for reconfiguration, employ bulky three-dimensional electromagnetic systems, and lack robust single-module control, which limits their applicability in biomedical settings. In this work, we present a modular magnetic millirobotic platform comprising three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets, each designed for a distinct functional role: a free module that supports self-assembly and reconfiguration, a fixed module that enables flip-and-walk locomotion, and a gripper module for cargo manipulation. Locomotion and reconfiguration are actuated by programmable combinations of time-varying two-dimensional uniform and gradient magnetic field inputs. Experiments demonstrate closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning, establishing robust single-module control capabilities. Beyond locomotion, the system achieves self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths. Chain-to-gripper transformations succeeded in 90% of trials, while chain-to-square transformations were less consistent, underscoring the role of module geometry in reconfiguration reliability. These results establish a versatile modular robotic platform capable of multimodal behavior and robust control, suggesting a promising pathway toward scalable and adaptive task execution in confined environments.

Title: Physics-Compliant Modeling and Optimization of MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers
Authors: Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising architecture for implementing linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing in the analog domain, with radio frequency (RF) signals. Existing studies on MiLAC-aided communications rely on idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling. However, since MiLAC performs processing at RF, mutual coupling becomes critical and alters the implemented operation, not only the channel characteristics. In this paper, we develop a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems accounting for mutual coupling with multiport network theory. We derive end-to-end system models for scenarios with MiLACs at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, showing how mutual coupling impacts the linear transformation implemented by the MiLACs. Furthermore, we formulate and solve a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem, deriving a closed-form globally optimal solution that maximizes the received signal power. We establish the fundamental performance limits of MiLAC with mutual coupling, and derive three analytical results. First, mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems, on average. Second, with mutual coupling, MiLAC performs as digital architectures equipped with a matching network, while having fewer RF chains. Third, with mutual coupling, MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures with no matching network. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings.

Title: DECAF: Dynamic Envelope Context-Aware Fusion for Speech-Envelope Reconstruction from EEG
Authors: Karan Thakkar, Mounya Elhilali
Abstract: Reconstructing the speech audio envelope from scalp neural recordings (EEG) is a central task for decoding a listener's attentional focus in applications like neuro-steered hearing aids. Current methods for this reconstruction, however, face challenges with fidelity and noise. Prevailing approaches treat it as a static regression problem, processing each EEG window in isolation and ignoring the rich temporal structure inherent in continuous speech. This study introduces a new, dynamic framework for envelope reconstruction that leverages this structure as a predictive temporal prior. We propose a state-space fusion model that combines direct neural estimates from EEG with predictions from recent speech context, using a learned gating mechanism to adaptively balance these cues. To validate this approach, we evaluate our model on the ICASSP 2023 Stimulus Reconstruction benchmark demonstrating significant improvements over static, EEG-only baselines. Our analyses reveal a powerful synergy between the neural and temporal information streams. Ultimately, this work reframes envelope reconstruction not as a simple mapping, but as a dynamic state-estimation problem, opening a new direction for developing more accurate and coherent neural decoding systems.

Title: Federated Causal Representation Learning in State-Space Systems for Decentralized Counterfactual Reasoning
Authors: Nazal Mohamed, Ayush Mohanty, Nagi Gebraeel
Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.

Title: Enhancing network resilience through topological switching
Authors: Fei Chen, Jorge Cortés, Sonia Martínez
Abstract: This work studies how to preemptively increase the resilience of a network by means of time-varying topological actuation. To do this, we focus on linear dynamical systems that are compatible with a given network, and consider policies that switch periodically between the given one and an alternative, topologically-compatible dynamics. In particular, we seek to solve design problems aimed at finding a) the optimal switching schedule between two preselected topologies, and b) an optimal topology and optimal switching schedule. By imposing periodicity, we first provide a metric of resilience in terms of the spectral abscissa of the averaged linear time-invariant dynamics. By restricting our policies to commutative networks, we then show how the optimal scheduling problem reduces to a convex optimization, providing a bound on the net resilience that can be achieved. After this, we find that the optimal, sparse commutative network to switch with is fully disconnected and allocates the spectral sum among the nodes of the network equally. We then impose additional restrictions on topology edge selection, which leads to a biconvex optimization for which certain matrix rank conditions guide the choice of weighting parameters to obtain desirable solutions. Finally, we provide two methods to solve this problem efficiently (based on a McCormick relaxation, and alternating minimization), and illustrate the results in simulations.

Title: Quantum Hamiltonian Learning using Time-Resolved Measurement Data and its Application to Gene Regulatory Network Inference
Authors: Mohammad Aamir Sohail, Ranga R. Sudharshan, S. Sandeep Pradhan, Arvind Rao
Abstract: We present a new Hamiltonian-learning framework based on time-resolved measurement data from a fixed local IC-POVM and its application to inferring gene regulatory networks. We introduce the quantum Hamiltonian-based gene-expression model (QHGM), in which gene interactions are encoded as a parameterized Hamiltonian that governs gene expression evolution over pseudotime. We derive finite-sample recovery guarantees and establish upper bounds on the number of time and measurement samples required for accurate parameter estimation with high probability, scaling polynomially with system size. To recover the QHGM parameters, we develop a scalable variational learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization. Our method recovers network structure efficiently on synthetic benchmarks and reveals novel, biologically plausible regulatory connections in Glioblastoma single-cell RNA sequencing data, highlighting its potential in cancer research. This framework opens new directions for applying quantum-like modeling to biological systems beyond the limits of classical inference.

Title: Bellman Value Decomposition for Task Logic in Safe Optimal Control
Authors: William Sharpless, Oswin So, Dylan Hirsch, Sylvia Herbert, Chuchu Fan
Abstract: Real-world tasks involve nuanced combinations of goal and safety specifications. In high dimensions, the challenge is exacerbated: formal automata become cumbersome, and the combination of sparse rewards tends to require laborious tuning. In this work, we consider the innate structure of the Bellman Value as a means to naturally organize the problem for improved automatic performance. Namely, we prove the Bellman Value for a complex task defined in temporal logic can be decomposed into a graph of Bellman Values, connected by a set of well-known Bellman equations (BEs): the Reach-Avoid BE, the Avoid BE, and a novel type, the Reach-Avoid-Loop BE. To solve the Value and optimal policy, we propose VDPPO, which embeds the decomposed Value graph into a two-layer neural net, bootstrapping the implicit dependencies. We conduct a variety of simulated and hardware experiments to test our method on complex, high-dimensional tasks involving heterogeneous teams and nonlinear dynamics. Ultimately, we find this approach greatly improves performance over existing baselines, balancing safety and liveness automatically.

Title: Training Deep Stereo Matching Networks on Tree Branch Imagery: A Benchmark Study for Real-Time UAV Forestry Applications
Authors: Yida Lin, Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Sam Schofield, Richard Green
Abstract: Autonomous drone-based tree pruning needs accurate, real-time depth estimation from stereo cameras. Depth is computed from disparity maps using $Z = f B/d$, so even small disparity errors cause noticeable depth mistakes at working distances. Building on our earlier work that identified DEFOM-Stereo as the best reference disparity generator for vegetation scenes, we present the first study to train and test ten deep stereo matching networks on real tree branch images. We use the Canterbury Tree Branches dataset -- 5,313 stereo pairs from a ZED Mini camera at 1080P and 720P -- with DEFOM-generated disparity maps as training targets. The ten methods cover step-by-step refinement, 3D convolution, edge-aware attention, and lightweight designs. Using perceptual metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, ViTScore) and structural metrics (SIFT/ORB feature matching), we find that BANet-3D produces the best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), while RAFT-Stereo scores highest on scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799). Testing on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super (16 GB, independently powered) mounted on our drone shows that AnyNet reaches 6.99 FPS at 1080P -- the only near-real-time option -- while BANet-2D gives the best quality-speed balance at 1.21 FPS. We also compare 720P and 1080P processing times to guide resolution choices for forestry drone systems.

Title: Transcending the Annotation Bottleneck: AI-Powered Discovery in Biology and Medicine
Authors: Soumick Chatterjee
Abstract: The dependence on expert annotation has long constituted the primary rate-limiting step in the application of artificial intelligence to biomedicine. While supervised learning drove the initial wave of clinical algorithms, a paradigm shift towards unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently unlocking the latent potential of biobank-scale datasets. By learning directly from the intrinsic structure of data - whether pixels in a magnetic resonance image (MRI), voxels in a volumetric scan, or tokens in a genomic sequence - these methods facilitate the discovery of novel phenotypes, the linkage of morphology to genetics, and the detection of anomalies without human bias. This article synthesises seminal and recent advances in "learning without labels," highlighting how unsupervised frameworks can derive heritable cardiac traits, predict spatial gene expression in histology, and detect pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised counterparts.

Title: Adaptive Underwater Acoustic Communications with Limited Feedback: An AoI-Aware Hierarchical Bandit Approach
Authors: Fabio Busacca, Andrea Panebianco, Yin Sun
Abstract: Underwater Acoustic (UWA) networks are vital for remote sensing and ocean exploration but face inherent challenges such as limited bandwidth, long propagation delays, and highly dynamic channels. These constraints hinder real-time communication and degrade overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bilevel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. At the fast inner level, a Contextual Delayed MAB (CD-MAB) jointly optimizes adaptive modulation and transmission power based on both channel state feedback and its Age of Information (AoI), thereby maximizing throughput. At the slower outer level, a Feedback Scheduling MAB dynamically adjusts the channel-state feedback interval according to throughput dynamics: stable throughput allows longer update intervals, while throughput drops trigger more frequent updates. This adaptive mechanism reduces feedback overhead and enhances responsiveness to varying network conditions. The proposed bilevel framework is computationally efficient and well-suited to resource-constrained UWA networks. Simulation results using the DESERT Underwater Network Simulator demonstrate throughput gains of up to 20.61% and energy savings of up to 36.60% compared with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baselines reported in the existing literature.

Title: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Probabilistic Framework for Search and Track Missions
Authors: Savvas Papaioannou, Panayiotis Kolios, Theocharis Theocharides, Christos G. Panayiotou, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: In this work a robust and scalable cooperative multi-agent searching and tracking framework is proposed. Specifically, we study the problem of cooperative searching and tracking of multiple moving targets by a group of autonomous mobile agents with limited sensing capabilities. We assume that the actual number of targets present is not known a priori and that target births/deaths can occur anywhere inside the surveillance region thus efficient search strategies are required to detect and track as many targets as possible. To address the aforementioned challenges we recursively compute and propagate in time the searching-and-tracking (SAT) density. Using the SAT-density, we then develop decentralized cooperative look-ahead strategies for efficient searching and tracking of an unknown number of targets inside a bounded surveillance area.

Title: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces and Next Generation Wireless Systems
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Hetong Wang, Tiejun Lv, Wei Ni
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a potential candidate for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 2.0 technology due to its low cost, ease of deployment, energy efficiency and extended coverage. This chapter investigates the slot-by-slot IRS reflection pattern design and two-timescale reflection pattern design schemes, respectively. For the slot-by-slot reflection optimization, we propose exploiting an IRS to improve the propagation channel rank in mmWave massive MIMO systems without need to increase the transmit power budget. Then, we analyze the impact of the distributed IRS on the channel rank. To further reduce the heavy overhead of channel training, channel state information (CSI) estimation, and feedback in time-varying MIMO channels, we present a two-timescale reflection optimization scheme, where the IRS is configured relatively infrequently based on statistical CSI (S-CSI) and the active beamformers and power allocation are updated based on quickly outdated instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) per slot. The achievable average sum-rate (AASR) of the system is maximized without excessive overhead of cascaded channel estimation. A recursive sampling particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the large-timescale IRS reflection pattern efficiently with reduced samplings of channel samples.

Title: Semi-on-Demand Hybrid Transit Route Design with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services
Authors: Max T.M. Ng, Florian Dandl, Hani S. Mahmassani, Klaus Bogenberger
Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) enable transit agencies to design more agile and responsive services at lower operating costs. This study designs and evaluates a semi-on-demand hybrid route directional service in the public transit network, offering on-demand flexible route service in low-density areas and fixed route service in higher-density areas. We develop analytically tractable cost expressions that capture access, waiting, and riding costs for users, and distance-based operating and time-based vehicle costs for operators. Two formulations are presented for strategic and tactical decisions in flexible route portion, fleet size, headway, and vehicle size optimization, enabling the determination of route types between fixed, hybrid, and flexible routes based on demand, cost, and operational parameters. Analytical results demonstrate that the lower operating costs of SAVs favor more flexible route services. The practical applications and benefits of semi-on-demand feeders are presented with numerical examples and a large-scale case study in the Chicago metropolitan area, USA. Findings reveal scenarios in which flexible route portions serving passengers located further away reduce total costs, particularly user costs, whereas higher demand densities favor more traditional line-based operations. Current cost forecasts suggest smaller vehicles with fully flexible routes are optimal, but operating constraints or higher operating costs would favor larger vehicles with hybrid routes. The study provides an analytical tool to design SAVs as directional services and transit feeders, and tractable continuous approximation formulations for planning and research in transit network design.

Title: IoT-enabled Stability Chamber for the Pharmaceutical Industry
Authors: Nitol Saha, Md Masruk Aulia, Dibakar Das, Md. Mostafizur Rahman
Abstract: A stability chamber is essential for pharmaceutical facilities to test the stability and quality of products over time by exposing them to different environmental conditions. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled stability chamber designed for the pharmaceutical industry. We constructed four stability chambers by leveraging the existing infrastructure within a manufacturing facility. Each chamber is controlled using a state-of-the-art Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) system based on the Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The Siemens WinCC Runtime Advanced platform, compliant with FDA 21 CFR Part 11, was used for visualizing chamber data. Additionally, an Internet of Things (IoT) application was developed to remotely monitor sensor data through any client application. This research aims to enhance the performance of traditional stability chambers by integrating IoT functionalities, making them more cost-effective and user-friendly.

Title: A Dual-Branch Parallel Network for Speech Enhancement and Restoration
Authors: Da-Hee Yang, Dail Kim, Joon-Hyuk Chang, Jeonghwan Choi, Han-gil Moon
Abstract: We present a novel general speech restoration model, DBP-Net (dual-branch parallel network), designed to effectively handle complex real-world distortions including noise, reverberation, and bandwidth degradation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single processing path or separate models for enhancement and restoration, DBP-Net introduces a unified architecture with dual parallel branches-a masking-based branch for distortion suppression and a mapping-based branch for spectrum reconstruction. A key innovation behind DBP-Net lies in the parameter sharing between the two branches and a cross-branch skip fusion, where the output of the masking branch is explicitly fused into the mapping branch. This design enables DBP-Net to simultaneously leverage complementary learning strategies-suppression and generation-within a lightweight framework. Experimental results show that DBP-Net significantly outperforms existing baselines in comprehensive speech restoration tasks while maintaining a compact model size. These findings suggest that DBP-Net offers an effective and scalable solution for unified speech enhancement and restoration in diverse distortion scenarios.

Title: Topographic Temperature: A Maximum-Entropy State Description of Running-In Surfaces
Authors: Boris Brodmann, Matthias Eifler
Abstract: Surface topography governs tribological performance, yet conventional parameters describe either amplitude statistics or spectral content in isolation. We introduce a scale-dependent framework that represents surface height and directional gradient as conjugate coordinates of a structural phase space. The elastic reference energy derived from Persson's contact mechanics theory defines a metric that couples surface geometry to the elastic half-space response. A maximum-entropy formulation yields a canonical state density. In the Gaussian limit this formulation recovers Persson's spectral description exactly, showing that the power spectral density is a complete contact mechanical descriptor only under Gaussian statistics. The associated Lagrange multiplier defines a topographic temperature in the sense of Grmela's multiscale thermodynamics and embeds the areal subsystem within a scale-dependent boundary potential. The framework is validated experimentally using ground and honed AISI 52100 steel discs before and after running in. The ground surface contracts toward lower entropy and elastic energy, whereas the honed surface expands into previously unoccupied states. These opposite trajectories become transparent only in the coupled height-gradient representation and highlight the role of the principal directional gradient for scale-aware surface metrology.

Title: The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories
Authors: Tran Thien Dat Nguyen, Ba Tuong Vo, Ba-Ngu Vo, Hoa Van Nguyen, Changbeom Shim
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fréchet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fréchet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.

Title: Fine-Grained Motion Compression and Selective Temporal Fusion for Neural B-Frame Video Coding
Authors: Xihua Sheng, Peilin Chen, Meng Wang, Li Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Dapeng Oliver Wu
Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling. By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed codec achieves an average BD-rate reduction of approximately 10% compared to the state-of-the-art neural B-frame codec, DCVC-B, and delivers comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC reference software under random-access configurations.

Title: Can Generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) Rival Specialist Medical VLMs? Benchmarking and Strategic Insights
Authors: Yuan Zhong, Ruinan Jin, Qi Dou, Xiaoxiao Li
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in automating image diagnosis and interpretation in clinical settings. However, developing specialist medical VLMs requires substantial computational resources and carefully curated datasets, and it remains unclear under which conditions generalist and specialist medical VLMs each perform best. This study highlights the complementary strengths of specialist medical and generalist VLMs. Specialists remain valuable in modality-aligned use cases, but we find that efficiently fine-tuned generalist VLMs can achieve comparable or even superior performance in most tasks, particularly when transferring to unseen or rare OOD medical modalities. These results suggest that generalist VLMs, rather than being constrained by their lack of specialist medical pretraining, may offer a scalable and cost-effective pathway for advancing clinical AI development.

Title: Adversarial Observability and Performance Trade-offs in Optimal Control
Authors: Filippos Fotiadis, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: We develop a feedback controller that minimizes the observability of a set of adversarial sensors of a linear system, while adhering to strict closed-loop performance constraints. We quantify the effectiveness of adversarial sensors using the trace of their observability Gramian and its inverse, capturing both average observability and the least observable state directions of the system. We derive theoretical lower bounds on these metrics under performance constraints, characterizing the fundamental limits of observability reduction as a function of the performance trade-off. Finally, we show that the performance-constrained optimization of the Gramian's trace can be formulated as a one-shot semidefinite program, while we address the optimization of its inverse through sequential semidefinite programming. Simulations on an aircraft show how the proposed scheme yields controllers that deteriorate adversarial observability while having near-optimal performance.

Title: Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps
Authors: Eric Mason, Sippanon Kitimoon, Hrushikesh Mhaskar
Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.

Title: Binaural Target Speaker Extraction using HRTFs
Authors: Yoav Ellinson, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of binaural target-speaker extraction in the presence of multiple simultane-ous talkers. We propose a novel approach that leverages the individual listener's Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) to isolate the target speaker. The proposed method is speaker-independent, as it does not rely on speaker embeddings. We employ a fully complex-valued neural network that operates directly on the complex-valued Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) of the mixed audio signals, and compare it to a Real-Imaginary (RI)-based neural network, demonstrating the advantages of the former. We first evaluate the method in an anechoic, noise-free scenario, achieving excellent extraction performance while preserving the binaural cues of the target signal. We then extend the evaluation to reverberant conditions. Our method proves robust, maintaining speech clarity and source directionality while simultaneously reducing reverberation. A comparative analysis with existing binaural Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) methods shows that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of noise reduction and perceptual quality, while providing a clear advantage in preserving binaural cues.

Title: The Universal Personalizer: Few-Shot Dysarthric Speech Recognition via Meta-Learning
Authors: Dhruuv Agarwal, Harry Zhang, Yang Yu, Quan Wang
Abstract: Personalizing dysarthric ASR is hindered by demanding enrollment collection and per-user training. We propose a hybrid meta-training method for a single model, enabling zero-shot and few-shot on-the-fly personalization via in-context learning (ICL). On Euphonia, it achieves 13.9% Word Error Rate (WER), surpassing speaker-independent baselines (17.5%). On SAP Test-1, our 5.3% WER outperforms the challenge-winning team (5.97%). On Test-2, our 9.49% trails only the winner (8.11%) but without relying on techniques like offline model-merging or custom audio chunking. Curation yields a 40% WER reduction using random same-speaker examples, validating active personalization. While static text curation fails to beat this baseline, oracle similarity reveals substantial headroom, highlighting dynamic acoustic retrieval as the next frontier. Data ablations confirm rapid low-resource speaker adaptation, establishing the model as a practical personalized solution.

Title: Safe and Near-Optimal Control with Online Dynamics Learning
Authors: Manish Prajapat, Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Andreas Krause
Abstract: Achieving both optimality and safety under unknown system dynamics is a central challenge in real-world deployment of agents. To address this, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning, where sufficient exploration is performed within the space of safe policies. Our method executes $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe policies while $\textit{optimistically}$ exploring informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.

Title: Compressed Multiband Sensing in FR3 Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
Authors: Dexin Wang, Isha Jariwala, Ahmad Bazzi, Sundeep Rangan, Theodore S. Rappaport, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel framework for multiband sensing using uplink quadrature amplitude modulation-modulated pilot symbols. To solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization. Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability (SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay root mean squared error of 34.46% and 40.76%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz) for 6G systems.

Title: Learning a Shape-adaptive Assist-as-needed Rehabilitation Policy from Therapist-informed Input
Authors: Zhimin Hou, Jiacheng Hou, Xiao Chen, Hamid Sadeghian, Tianyu Ren, Sami Haddadin
Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing corrective force and improving movement smoothness.

Title: PhoenixCodec: Taming Neural Speech Coding for Extreme Low-Resource Scenarios
Authors: Zixiang Wan, Haoran Zhao, Guochang Zhang, Runqiang Han, Jianqiang Wei, Yuexian Zou
Abstract: This paper presents PhoenixCodec, a comprehensive neural speech coding and decoding framework designed for extremely low-resource conditions. The proposed system integrates an optimized asymmetric frequency-time architecture, a Cyclical Calibration and Refinement (CCR) training strategy, and a noise-invariant fine-tuning procedure. Under stringent constraints - computation below 700 MFLOPs, latency less than 30 ms, and dual-rate support at 1 kbps and 6 kbps - existing methods face a trade-off between efficiency and quality. PhoenixCodec addresses these challenges by alleviating the resource scattering of conventional decoders, employing CCR to enhance optimization stability, and enhancing robustness through noisy-sample fine-tuning. In the LRAC 2025 Challenge Track 1, the proposed system ranked third overall and demonstrated the best performance at 1 kbps in both real-world noise and reverberation and intelligibility in clean tests, confirming its effectiveness.

Title: Robust Multi-Agent Safety via Tube-Based Tightened Exponential Barrier Functions
Authors: Armel Koulong, Ali Pakniyat
Abstract: This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances. The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form, accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF) constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety guarantees.

Title: RFI Detection and Identification at OVRO Using Pseudonymetry
Authors: Meles Weldegebriel, Zihan Li, Greg Hellbourg, Ning Zhang, Neal Patwari
Abstract: Protecting passive radio astronomy observatories from unintended radio-frequency interference (RFI) is increasingly challenging as wireless activity expands near protected bands. While radio quiet zones, database-driven coordination, and post-processing mitigation can reduce interference risk, they often lack the ability to attribute detected RFI to a specific transmitter, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes where conventional demodulation is infeasible. This paper presents the first over-the-air field demonstration of Pseudonymetry at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), evaluating an accountable coexistence approach between heterogeneous systems: an SDR-based narrowband OFDM transmitter and a wideband radio telescope backend. The transmitter embeds a pseudonym watermark on a dedicated OFDM subcarrier using coded power modulation, while OVRO passively extracts the watermark from standard backend spectrogram (power) products without IQ access. We develop a spectrogram-only receiver that performs correlation-based packet alignment, compensates timing resolution mismatch via resampling, and decodes pseudonym bits using energy-domain template matching. Field results across -20 to -5 dB SNR show that pseudonym watermarks can be recovered at low SNR, enabling practical transmitter attribution using only passive backend measurements. These findings suggest that observatories can support lightweight accountability mechanisms that complement dynamic protection and enforcement-oriented spectrum sharing frameworks.

Title: Mutual Coupling Aware Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Multi-User mmWave Systems
Authors: Tian Qiu, Ruidong Li, Cunhua Pan, Taihaon Zhang, Dongnan Xia, Changhong Wang, Hong Ren
Abstract: This paper proposes a three-stage uplink channel estimation protocol for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where both the base station (BS) and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme. Simulation results validate that the proposed method yields better performance than the MC-unaware and existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency.

Title: Stability of a DC Microgrid with a Nonlinear Nested Control Framework: The Fast Communication Scenario
Authors: Cornelia Skaga, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz
Abstract: As modern power systems continue to evolve into multi-agent, converter-dominated systems that demand reliable, stable, and optimal control architectures within an expandable framework, this paper investigates scalable stability guarantees of a promising nonlinear communication-reliant control framework for DC microgrids. Particularly, relying on nested control loops; inner decentralized(primary) and outer distributed(secondary), the control configurations are designed to simultaneously achieve proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits, at the converged steady state. By enforcing sufficient time-scale separation at the boarder between the control loops, the system admits a singular perturbation formulation, allowing global exponential stability (G.E.S.) to be established via Lyapunov arguments. Although the theoretical G.E.S. certificate is structurally scalable, the stability guarantees depends on a sufficiently large permanent leakage, introduced in the primary controller. Thus, the results of this paper emphasize the importance of appropriate practical tuning guidelines and electrical parameter selection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through case studies on a low-voltage DC microgrid under load variations and topological changes (and communication time-delays), followed by a small-signal stability analysis.

Title: Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges
Authors: Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.

Title: PalpAid: Multimodal Pneumatic Tactile Sensor for Tissue Palpation
Authors: Devi Yuliarti, Ravi Prakash, Hiu Ching Cheung, Amy Strong, Patrick J. Codd, Shan Lin
Abstract: The tactile properties of tissue, such as elasticity and stiffness, often play an important role in surgical oncology when identifying tumors and pathological tissue boundaries. Though extremely valuable, robot-assisted surgery comes at the cost of reduced sensory information to the surgeon, with vision being the primary. Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor to restore touch in robot-assisted surgery. PalpAid is equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the acoustic signature assists in tissue identification. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests for robustness to use, repetition cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we demonstrate the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. We envision PalpAid to be easily retrofitted with existing surgical/general robotic systems, allowing soft tissue palpation.

Title: Trustworthy Equipment Monitoring via Cascaded Anomaly Detection and Saliency-Guided Inspection
Authors: Sungwoo Kang
Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and actionable, interpretable explanations. While fusing sensor time-series with thermal imagery is promising, naive fusion can actually degrade performance. This paper provides evidence-based guidelines for interpretability-driven model selection, demonstrating that cascaded architectures outperform end-to-end fusion in industrial monitoring. We propose a two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses a Random Forest on statistical sensor features for robust anomaly detection (94.70% macro F1), while Stage 2 employs a convolutional thermal encoder with spatial attention for post-detection inspection. Rigorous analysis reveals traditional machine learning significantly outperforms deep learning baselines (Cohen's d = 3.04-8.81) on low-noise, filtered sensor data. Additionally, we introduce a diagnostic protocol using gate weight analysis to quantify modality bias, preventing over-reliance on visually rich but less informative data. Our explainability pipeline integrates Shapley-based sensor ranking with spatial attention. Finally, perturbation audits confirm thermal attention acts as a spatial regularizer, with the thermal encoder achieving a 78.49% fault-detection F1, demonstrating learned sensitivity to fault presence despite poor severity grading.

Title: Hybrid Control Technique for Switched LPV Systems and Its Application to Active Magnetic Bearing System
Authors: Fen Wu
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid control framework for switched linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems under hysteresis switching logic. By introducing a controller state-reset mechanism, the hybrid LPV synthesis problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), enabling efficient computation of both switching LPV controller gains and reset matrices. The proposed approach is then applied to active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems, whose rotor dynamics exhibit strong dependence on rotational speed. Conventional LPV designs are often conservative due to large speed variations. The proposed hybrid gain-scheduled controller explicitly accounts for bounds on parameter variation rates, employs multiple LPV controllers over distinct operating regions, and uses hysteresis switching to reduce chattering and ensure stability. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a detailed AMB control design example.

Title: Zero-shot Multi-Contrast Brain MRI Registration by Intensity Randomizing T1-weighted MRI (LUMIR25)
Authors: Hengjie Liu, Yimeng Dou, Di Xu, Xinyi Fu, Dan Ruan, Ke Sheng
Abstract: In this paper, we present our submission to the LUMIR25 task of Learn2Reg 2025, which ranked 1st overall on the test set. Extended from LUMIR24, this year's task focuses on zero-shot registration under domain shifts (e.g., high-field MRI, pathological brains, and various MRI contrasts), while the training data comprises only in-domain T1-weighted brain MRI. We start with a meticulous analysis of LUMIR24 winners to identify the main contributors to strong monomodal registration performance. We highlight the importance of registration-specific inductive biases, including multi-resolution pyramids, inverse and group consistency, topological preservation or diffeomorphism, and correlation-based correspondence establishment. To further generalize to diverse contrasts, we employ three simple but effective strategies: (i) a multimodal loss based on the modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND), (ii) intensity randomization for unseen contrast augmentation, and (iii) lightweight instance-specific optimization (ISO) on feature encoders at inference time. On the validation set, the proposed approach substantially improves T1-T2 registration accuracy, demonstrating robust cross-contrast generalization without relying on explicit image synthesis. These results suggest a practical step toward a registration foundation model that can leverage a single training domain yet remain robust across domain shifts.

Title: Visible and Hyperspectral Imaging for Quality Assessment of Milk: Property Characterisation and Identification
Authors: Massimo Martinelli, Elena Tomassi, Nafiou Arouna, Morena Gabriele, Laryssa Perez Fabbri, Luisa Pozzo, Bianca Castiglioni, Paola Cremonesi, Giuseppe Conte, Davide Moroni, Laura Pucci
Abstract: Rapid and non-destructive assessment of milk quality is crucial to ensuring both nutritional value and food safety. In this study, we investigated the potential of visible and hyperspectral imaging as cost-effective and quick-response alternatives to conventional chemical analyses for characterizing key properties of cowś milk. A total of 52 milk samples were analysed to determine their biochemical composition (polyphenols, antioxidant capacity, and fatty acids) using spectrophotometer methods and standard gas-liquid and high-performance liquid chromatography (GLC/HPLC). Concurrently, visible (RGB) images were captured using a standard smartphone, and hyperspectral data were acquired in the near-infrared range. A comprehensive analytical framework, including eleven different machine learning algorithms, was employed to correlate imaging features with biochemical measurements. Analysis of visible images accurately distinguished between fresh samples and those stored for 12 days (100 percent accuracy) and achieved perfect discrimination between antibiotic-treated and untreated groups (100 percent accuracy). Moreover, image-derived features enabled perfect prediction of the polyphenols content and the antioxidant capacity using an XGBoost model. Hyperspectral imaging further achieved classification accuracies exceeding 95 percent for several individual fatty acids and 94.8 percent for treatment groups using a Random Forest model. These findings demonstrate that both visible and hyperspectral imaging, when coupled with machine learning, are powerful, non-invasive tools for the rapid assessment of milkś chemical and nutritional profiles, highlighting the strong potential of imaging-based approaches for milk quality assessment.

Title: Learning-based data-enabled moving horizon estimation with application to membrane-based biological wastewater treatment process
Authors: Xiaojie Li, Xunyuan Yin
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-enabled moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach for nonlinear systems. While the approach is formulated by leveraging Koopman theory, its implementation does not require explicit Koopman modeling. Lifting functions are learned from the state and input data of the original nonlinear system to project the system trajectories into the lifted space, where the resulting trajectories implicitly describe the Koopman representation for the original nonlinear system. A convex data-enabled MHE formulation is developed to provide real-time state estimates of the Koopman representation, from which the states of the nonlinear system can be reconstructed. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the stability of the estimation error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using a membrane-based biological water treatment process.

Title: Scan-Adaptive Dynamic MRI Undersampling Using a Dictionary of Efficiently Learned Patterns
Authors: Siddhant Gautam, Angqi Li, Prachi P. Agarwal, Anil K. Attili, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Nicole Seiberlich, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Cardiac MRI is limited by long acquisition times, which can lead to patient discomfort and motion artifacts. We aim to accelerate Cartesian dynamic cardiac MRI by learning efficient, scan-adaptive undersampling patterns that preserve diagnostic image quality. We develop a learning-based framework for designing scan- or slice-adaptive Cartesian undersampling masks tailored to dynamic cardiac MRI. Undersampling patterns are optimized using fully sampled training dynamic time-series data. At inference time, a nearest-neighbor search in low-frequency $k$-space selects an optimized mask from a dictionary of learned patterns. Our learned sampling approach improves reconstruction quality across multiple acceleration factors on public and in-house cardiac MRI datasets, including PSNR gains of 2-3 dB, reduced NMSE, improved SSIM, and higher radiologist ratings. The proposed scan-adaptive sampling framework enables faster and higher-quality dynamic cardiac MRI by adapting $k$-space sampling to individual scans.

Title: Deep Image Prior for Computed Tomography Reconstruction
Authors: Simon Arridge, Riccardo Barbano, Alexander Denker, Zeljko Kereta
Abstract: We present a comprehensive overview of the Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework and its applications to image reconstruction in computed tomography. Unlike conventional deep learning methods that rely on large, supervised datasets, the DIP exploits the implicit bias of convolutional neural networks and operates in a fully unsupervised setting, requiring only a single measurement, even in the presence of noise. We describe the standard DIP formulation, outline key algorithmic design choices, and review several strategies to mitigate overfitting, including early stopping, explicit regularisation, and self-guided methods that adapt the network input. In addition, we examine computational improvements such as warm-start and stochastic optimisation methods to reduce the reconstruction time. The discussed methods are tested on real $\mu$CT measurements, which allows examination of trade-offs among the different modifications and extensions.

Title: NeuroSleep: Neuromorphic Event-Driven Single-Channel EEG Sleep Staging for Edge-Efficient Sensing
Authors: Boyu Li, Xingchun Zhu, Yonghui Wu
Abstract: Objective. Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. Approach. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Main results. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded sleep-cassette (SC) subset with single-channel EEG demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared to the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. Significance. By coupling neuromorphic event encoding with state-aware context modeling, NeuroSleep offers a deployment-oriented framework for single-channel sleep staging that reduces redundant high-rate processing and improves energy scalability for wearable and edge platforms.

Title: Resource-Aware Distributed Submodular Maximization: A Paradigm for Multi-Robot Decision-Making
Authors: Zirui Xu, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: Multi-robot decision-making is the process where multiple robots coordinate actions. In this paper, we aim for efficient and effective multi-robot decision-making despite the robots' limited on-board resources and the often resource-demanding complexity of their tasks. We introduce the first algorithm enabling the robots to choose with which few other robots to coordinate and provably balance the trade-off of centralized vs. decentralized coordination. Particularly, centralization favors globally near-optimal decision-making but at the cost of increased on-board resource requirements; whereas, decentralization favors minimal resource requirements but at a global suboptimality cost. All robots can thus afford our algorithm, irrespective of their resources. We are motivated by the future of autonomy that involves multiple robots coordinating actions to complete resource-demanding tasks, such as target tracking, area coverage, and monitoring. To provide closed-form guarantees, we focus on maximization problems involving monotone and 2nd-order submodular functions. To capture the cost of decentralization, we introduce the notion of Centralization Of Information among non-Neighbors (COIN). We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of image covering.

Title: A Mini-Batch Quasi-Newton Proximal Method for Constrained Total-Variation Nonlinear Image Reconstruction
Authors: Tao Hong, Thanh-an Pham, Irad Yavneh, Michael Unser
Abstract: Over the years, computational imaging with accurate nonlinear physical models has garnered considerable interest due to its ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions. However, using such nonlinear models for reconstruction is computationally demanding. A popular choice for solving the corresponding inverse problems is the accelerated stochastic proximal method (ASPM), with the caveat that each iteration is still expensive. To overcome this issue, we propose a mini-batch quasi-Newton proximal method (BQNPM) tailored to image reconstruction problems with constrained total variation regularization. Compared to ASPM, BQNPM requires fewer iterations to converge. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach to compute a weighted proximal mapping at a cost similar to that of the proximal mapping in ASPM. We also analyze the convergence of BQNPM in the nonconvex setting. We assess the performance of BQNPM on three-dimensional inverse-scattering problems with linear and nonlinear physical models. Our results on simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BQNPM, while also validating our theoretical analysis.

Title: Model Selection and Parameter Estimation of One-Dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Hai Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with a specific focus on estimating both the model order and the mixing distribution from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. This paper establishes the optimal sampling complexity for model order estimation in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. We prove a fundamental lower bound on the number of samples required to correctly identify the number of components with high probability, showing that this limit depends critically on the separation between component means and the total number of components. We then propose a Fourier-based approach to estimate both the model order and the mixing distribution. Our algorithm utilizes Fourier measurements constructed from the samples, and our analysis demonstrates that its sample complexity matches the established lower bound, thereby confirming its optimality. Numerical experiments further show that our method outperforms conventional techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Title: MEt3R: Measuring Multi-View Consistency in Generated Images
Authors: Mohammad Asim, Christopher Wewer, Thomas Wimmer, Bernt Schiele, Jan Eric Lenssen
Abstract: We introduce MEt3R, a metric for multi-view consistency in generated images. Large-scale generative models for multi-view image generation are rapidly advancing the field of 3D inference from sparse observations. However, due to the nature of generative modeling, traditional reconstruction metrics are not suitable to measure the quality of generated outputs and metrics that are independent of the sampling procedure are desperately needed. In this work, we specifically address the aspect of consistency between generated multi-view images, which can be evaluated independently of the specific scene. Our approach uses DUSt3R to obtain dense 3D reconstructions from image pairs in a feed-forward manner, which are used to warp image contents from one view into the other. Then, feature maps of these images are compared to obtain a similarity score that is invariant to view-dependent effects. Using MEt3R, we evaluate the consistency of a large set of previous methods for novel view and video generation, including our open, multi-view latent diffusion model.

Title: JavisDiT: Joint Audio-Video Diffusion Transformer with Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Prior Synchronization
Authors: Kai Liu, Wei Li, Lai Chen, Shengqiong Wu, Yanhao Zheng, Jiayi Ji, Fan Zhou, Jiebo Luo, Ziwei Liu, Hao Fei, Tat-Seng Chua
Abstract: This paper introduces JavisDiT, a novel Joint Audio-Video Diffusion Transformer designed for synchronized audio-video generation (JAVG). Based on the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT simultaneously generates high-quality audio and video content from open-ended user prompts in a unified framework. To ensure audio-video synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, which consists of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos and focuses on synchronization evaluation in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for measuring the synchrony between generated audio-video pairs in real-world content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks.

Title: A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data
Authors: Sifei Li, Mining Tan, Feier Shen, Minyan Luo, Zijiao Yin, Fan Tang, Weiming Dong, Changsheng Xu
Abstract: Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.

Title: $O(1/k)$ Finite-Time Bound for Non-Linear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation
Authors: Siddharth Chandak
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA) is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. In this work, we derive mean squared error bounds for non-linear two-time-scale iterations with contractive mappings. In the setting where both stepsizes are order $\Theta(1/k)$, commonly referred to as single time-scale SA with multiple coupled sequences, we obtain the first $O(1/k)$ rate without imposing additional smoothness assumptions. In the setting with true time-scale separation, the previous best bound was $O(1/k^{2/3})$. We improve this to $O(1/k^a)$ for any $a<1$ approaching the optimal $O(1/k)$ rate. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence whose variance decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation. Our results apply to Polyak averaging, as well as to algorithms from reinforcement learning, and optimization, including gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization.

Title: MEGADance: Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Genre-Aware 3D Dance Generation
Authors: Kaixing Yang, Xulong Tang, Ziqiao Peng, Yuxuan Hu, Jun He, Hongyan Liu
Abstract: Music-driven 3D dance generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, with promising applications in choreography, virtual reality, and creative content creation. Previous research has generated promising realistic dance movement from audio signals. However, traditional methods underutilize genre conditioning, often treating it as auxiliary modifiers rather than core semantic drivers. This oversight compromises music-motion synchronization and disrupts dance genre continuity, particularly during complex rhythmic transitions, thereby leading to visually unsatisfactory effects. To address the challenge, we propose MEGADance, a novel architecture for music-driven 3D dance generation. By decoupling choreographic consistency into dance generality and genre specificity, MEGADance demonstrates significant dance quality and strong genre controllability. It consists of two stages: (1) High-Fidelity Dance Quantization Stage (HFDQ), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and reconstructs them with kinematic-dynamic constraints, and (2) Genre-Aware Dance Generation Stage (GADG), which maps music into the latent representation by synergistic utilization of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with Mamba-Transformer hybrid backbone. Extensive experiments on the FineDance and AIST++ dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MEGADance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: E-BATS: Efficient Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Jiaheng Dong, Hong Jia, Soumyajit Chatterjee, Abhirup Ghosh, James Bailey, Ting Dang
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.

Title: AeroGPT: Leveraging Large-Scale Audio Model for Aero-Engine Bearing Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Jiale Liu, Dandan Peng, Huan Wang, Chenyu Liu, Yan-Fu Li, Min Xie
Abstract: Aerospace engines, as critical components in aviation and aerospace industries, require continuous and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure operational safety and prevent catastrophic failures. While deep learning techniques have been extensively studied in this context, they typically output logits or confidence scores, necessitating post-processing to obtain actionable insights. Furthermore, the potential of large-scale audio models for this task remains largely untapped. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AeroGPT, a novel framework that transfers knowledge from the general audio domain to aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis. AeroGPT leverages a large-scale audio model and incorporates Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to adapt general audio knowledge to domain-specific vibration patterns, along with Generative Fault Classification (GFC) to directly generate interpretable fault labels. This approach eliminates the need for label post-processing and supports interactive, interpretable, and actionable fault diagnosis, thereby enhancing industrial applicability. Through comprehensive experimental validation on two aero-engine bearing datasets, AeroGPT achieves 98.94% accuracy on the DIRG dataset and 100% accuracy on the HIT bearing dataset, outperforming representative deep learning approaches. Qualitative analysis and further discussion also demonstrate its potential for interactive diagnosis and real-world deployment, highlighting the promise of large-scale audio models to advance fault diagnosis in aerospace applications.

Title: Mechanistic Interpretability with Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators
Authors: Bahareh Tolooshams, Ailsa Shen, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: We introduce sparse autoencoder neural operators (SAE-NOs), a new class of sparse autoencoders that operate directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces. We generalize the linear representation hypothesis to a functional representation hypothesis, enabling concept learning beyond vector-valued representations. Unlike standard SAEs that employ multi-layer perceptrons (SAE-MLP) to each concept with a scalar activation, we introduce and formalize sparse autoencoder neural operators (SAE-NOs), which extend vector-valued representations to functional ones. We instantiate this framework as SAE Fourier neural operators (SAE-FNOs), parameterizing concepts as integral operators in the Fourier domain. We show that this functional parameterization fundamentally shapes learned concepts, leading to improved stability with respect to sparsity level, robustness to distribution shifts, and generalization across discretizations. We show that SAE-FNO is more efficient in concept utilization across data population and more effective in extracting localized patterns from data. We show that convolutional SAEs (SAE-CNNs) do not generalize their sparse representations to unseen input resolutions, whereas SAE-FNOs operate across resolutions and reliably recover the underlying representations. Our results demonstrate that moving from fixed-dimensional to functional representations extends sparse autoencoders from detectors of concept presence to models that capture the underlying structure of the data, highlighting parameterization as a central driver of interpretability and generalization.

Title: A Digital Pheromone-Based Approach for In-Control/Out-of-Control Classification
Authors: Pedro Pestana, M. Fátima Brilhante
Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control (OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences, representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics, imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score, obtained as the sum of the Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score, is used as the main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and predictive maintenance in industrial environments.

Title: Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs
Authors: Santiago Cuervo, Skyler Seto, Maureen de Seyssel, Richard He Bai, Zijin Gu, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Navdeep Jaitly, Zakaria Aldeneh
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Title: SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions
Authors: Md. Mehedi Hassan, Shafqat Alam, Shahriar Ahmed Seam, Maruf Ahmed
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of diverse heterogeneous brain lesions using multi-modal MRI is a challenging problem in clinical neuroimaging, mainly because of the lack of generalizability and high prediction variance of pathology-specific deep learning models. In this work, we propose a unified and adaptive multi-stream framework called SYNAPSE-Net to perform robust multi-pathology segmentation with reduced performance variance. The framework is based on multi-stream convolutional encoders with global context modeling and a cross-modal attention fusion strategy to ensure stable and effective multi-modal feature integration. It also employs a variance-aware training strategy to enhance the robustness of the network across diverse tasks. The framework is extensively validated using three public challenge datasets: WMH MICCAI 2017, ISLES 2022, and BraTS 2020. The results show consistent improvements in boundary accuracy, delineation quality, and stability across diverse pathologies. This proposed framework achieved a high Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.831 and a low Hausdorff distance at the 95th percentile (HD95) of 3.03 on the WMH MICCAI 2017 dataset. It also achieved the lowest HD95 of 9.69 on the ISLES 2022 dataset and the highest tumor core DSC of 0.8651 on the BraTS 2020 dataset. These results validate the robustness of the proposed framework in providing a clinically relevant computer-aided solution for automated brain lesion segmentation.

Title: Mathematical Foundations of Polyphonic Music Generation via Structural Inductive Bias
Authors: Joonwon Seo
Abstract: This monograph introduces a novel approach to polyphonic music generation by addressing the "Missing Middle" problem through structural inductive bias. Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Title: Adaptive Monitoring of Stochastic Fire Front Processes via Information-seeking Predictive Control
Authors: Savvas Papaioannou, Panayiotis Kolios, Christos G. Panayiotou, Marios M. Polycarpou
Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.

Title: GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing
Authors: Shih-Fang Chen, Jun-Cheng Chen, I-Hong Jhuo, Yen-Yu Lin
Abstract: Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.
