Title: Exploring Emotional Synchrony in Dyadic Interactions: The Role of Speech Conditions in Facial and Vocal Affective Alignment
Authors: Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela, Yukie Nagai
Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony, this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities. Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer, more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective alignment in real world interaction.

Title: SPIRIT: Patching Speech Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks
Authors: Amirbek Djanibekov, Nurdaulet Mukhituly, Kentaro Inui, Hanan Aldarmaki, Nils Lukas
Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) enable natural interactions via spoken instructions, which more effectively capture user intent by detecting nuances in speech. The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99% with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to SLMs.

Title: GANCompress: GAN-Enhanced Neural Image Compression with Binary Spherical Quantization
Authors: Karthik Sivakoti
Abstract: The exponential growth of visual data in digital communications has intensified the need for efficient compression techniques that balance rate-distortion performance with computational feasibility. While recent neural compression approaches have shown promise, they still struggle with fundamental challenges: preserving perceptual quality at high compression ratios, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse visual content. This paper introduces GANCompress, a novel neural compression framework that synergistically combines Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address these challenges. Our approach employs a transformer-based autoencoder with an enhanced BSQ bottleneck that projects latent representations onto a hypersphere, enabling efficient discretization with bounded quantization error. This is followed by a specialized GAN architecture incorporating frequency-domain attention and color consistency optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that GANCompress achieves substantial improvement in compression efficiency -- reducing file sizes by up to 100x with minimal visual distortion. Our method outperforms traditional codecs like H.264 by 12-15% in perceptual metrics while maintaining comparable PSNR/SSIM values, with 2.4x faster encoding and decoding speeds. On standard benchmarks including ImageNet-1k and COCO2017, GANCompress sets a new state-of-the-art, reducing FID from 0.72 to 0.41 (43% improvement) compared to previous methods while maintaining higher throughput. This work presents a significant advancement in neural compression technology with promising applications for real-time visual communication systems.

Title: Learning Wavelet-Sparse FDK for 3D Cone-Beam CT Reconstruction
Authors: Yipeng Sun, Linda-Sophie Schneider, Chengze Ye, Mingxuan Gu, Siyuan Mei, Siming Bayer, Andreas Maier
Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is essential in medical imaging, and the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is a popular choice for reconstruction due to its efficiency. However, FDK is susceptible to noise and artifacts. While recent deep learning methods offer improved image quality, they often increase computational complexity and lack the interpretability of traditional methods. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced FDK-based neural network that maintains the classical algorithm's interpretability by selectively integrating trainable elements into the cosine weighting and filtering stages. Recognizing the challenge of a large parameter space inherent in 3D CBCT data, we leverage wavelet transformations to create sparse representations of the cosine weights and filters. This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by $93.75\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and importantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the classical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and boosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward integration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a pragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in environments with computational limitations.

Title: Direction-Aware Neural Acoustic Fields for Few-Shot Interpolation of Ambisonic Impulse Responses
Authors: Christopher Ick, Gordon Wichern, Yoshiki Masuyama, François Germain, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: The characteristics of a sound field are intrinsically linked to the geometric and spatial properties of the environment surrounding a sound source and a listener. The physics of sound propagation is captured in a time-domain signal known as a room impulse response (RIR). Prior work using neural fields (NFs) has allowed learning spatially-continuous representations of RIRs from finite RIR measurements. However, previous NF-based methods have focused on monaural omnidirectional or at most binaural listeners, which does not precisely capture the directional characteristics of a real sound field at a single point. We propose a direction-aware neural field (DANF) that more explicitly incorporates the directional information by Ambisonic-format RIRs. While DANF inherently captures spatial relations between sources and listeners, we further propose a direction-aware loss. In addition, we investigate the ability of DANF to adapt to new rooms in various ways including low-rank adaptation.

Title: Non-Invasive Arterial Pulse Detection with Millimeter-wave Radar and Comparison With Photoplethysmography
Authors: Nima Bahmani, Dariush Salami, Hüseyin Yiğitler, Juhapekka Hietala, Tuukka Panula, Stephan Sigg
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and disability. The convenient measurement of cardiovascular health using smart systems is therefore a key enabler to foster accurate and early detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and it require accessing a correct pulse morphology similar to arterial pressure wave. This paper investigates the comparison between different sensor modalities, such as mmWave and photoplethysmography from the same physiological site and reference continuous non-invasive blood pressure devide. We have developed a hardware prototype and established an experiment consist of 23 test participants. Both mmWave and PPG are capable of detecting inter-beat intervals. mmWave is providing more accurate arterial pulse waveform than green photoplethysmography.

Title: Reduced Muscle Fatigue Using Continuous Subthreshold Kilohertz Stimulation of Peripheral Nerves
Authors: Long Meng, Paola Terolli, Xiaogang Hu
Abstract: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a prevalent technique commonly used to activate muscles in individuals with neurological disorders. Traditional FES strategies predominantly utilize low-frequency (LF) stimulation, which evokes synchronous action potentials, leading to rapid muscle fatigue. To address these limitations, we introduced a subthreshold high-frequency (HF) stimulation method that employed continuous, charge-balanced subthreshold current pulses at kilohertz frequencies, designed to evoke motor unit (MU) activation similar to voluntary activation. We evaluated the effectiveness of HF stimulation on the reduction of muscle fatigue across different force levels (10 %, 25 %, and 40 % of maximum force). The HF stimulation utilized continuous charge-balanced, short pulses of 80 {\mu}s (at a 10 kHz frequency) targeted the ulnar/median nerve bundles. We compared the fatigue effects with conventional LF stimulation and voluntary muscle contractions. Our results indicated that HF stimulation maintained more sustained force outputs and muscle activation over a prolonged time compared with LF stimulation. The HF stimulation also evoked a more dispersed muscle activation pattern, similar to voluntary muscle contractions. These findings suggest that HF stimulation can significantly enhance the sustainability of muscle contractions and reduce muscle fatigue, potentially improving the efficacy and applicability of FES in clinical and home-based settings for individuals with neurological impairments.

Title: Incremental Firmware Update Over-the-Air for Low-Power IoT Devices over LoRaWAN
Authors: Andrea De Simone, Giovanna Turvani, Fabrizio Riente
Abstract: Efficiently supporting remote firmware updates in Internet of Things (IoT) devices remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of many IoT communication protocols, which often make it impractical to transmit full firmware images. Techniques such as firmware partitioning have been introduced to mitigate this issue, but they frequently fall short, especially in battery-powered systems where time and energy constraints are critical. As a result, physical maintenance interventions are still commonly required, which is costly and inconvenient in large-scale deployments. In this work, we present a lightweight and innovative method that addresses this challenge by generating highly compact delta patches, enabling firmware reconstruction directly on the device. Our algorithm is specifically optimized for low-power devices, minimizing both memory usage and computational overhead. Compared to existing solutions, our approach significantly reduces the data volume needed for updates while maintaining performance comparable to more complex alternatives. Experimental evaluations confirm that our method yields substantial time and energy savings, making it particularly well-suited for battery-powered IoT nodes. Although our implementation targets the LoRaWAN protocol, the approach is flexible and can be adapted to other IoT communication technologies.

Title: Articulatory Feature Prediction from Surface EMG during Speech Production
Authors: Jihwan Lee, Kevin Huang, Kleanthis Avramidis, Simon Pistrosch, Monica Gonzalez-Machorro, Yoonjeong Lee, Björn Schuller, Louis Goldstein, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: We present a model for predicting articulatory features from surface electromyography (EMG) signals during speech production. The proposed model integrates convolutional layers and a Transformer block, followed by separate predictors for articulatory features. Our approach achieves a high prediction correlation of approximately 0.9 for most articulatory features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these predicted articulatory features can be decoded into intelligible speech waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first method to decode speech waveforms from surface EMG via articulatory features, offering a novel approach to EMG-based speech synthesis. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between EMG electrode placement and articulatory feature predictability, providing knowledge-driven insights for optimizing EMG electrode configurations. The source code and decoded speech samples are publicly available.

Title: RainfalLTE: A Zero-effect Rainfall Sensing System Utilizing Existing LTE Infrastructure
Authors: Xianbin Jiang, Fei Shang, Haohua Du, Panlong Yang, Xing Guo, Lihong Liang, Yuanting Zhang, Xiang-Yang Li
Abstract: Environmental sensing is an important research topic in the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Current works often focus on static environments, such as buildings and terrains. However, dynamic factors like rainfall can cause serious interference to wireless signals. In this paper, we propose a system called RainfalLTE that utilizes the downlink signal of LTE base stations for device-independent rain sensing. In articular, it is fully compatible with current communication modes and does not require any additional hardware. We evaluate it with LTE data and rainfall information provided by a weather radar in Badaling Town, Beijing The results show that for 10 classes of rainfall, RainfalLTE achieves over 97% identification accuracy. Our case study shows that the assistance of rainfall information can bring more than 40% energy saving, which provides new opportunities for the design and optimization of ISAC systems.

Title: Pushing the Frontiers of Self-Distillation Prototypes Network with Dimension Regularization and Score Normalization
Authors: Yafeng Chen, Chong Deng, Hui Wang, Yiheng Jiang, Han Yin, Qian Chen, Wen Wang
Abstract: Developing robust speaker verification (SV) systems without speaker labels has been a longstanding challenge. Earlier research has highlighted a considerable performance gap between self-supervised and fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we enhance the non-contrastive self-supervised framework, Self-Distillation Prototypes Network (SDPN), by introducing dimension regularization that explicitly addresses the collapse problem through the application of regularization terms to speaker embeddings. Moreover, we integrate score normalization techniques from fully supervised SV to further bridge the gap toward supervised verification performance. SDPN with dimension regularization and score normalization sets a new state-of-the-art on the VoxCeleb1 speaker verification evaluation benchmark, achieving Equal Error Rate 1.29%, 1.60%, and 2.80% for trial VoxCeleb1-{O,E,H} respectively. These results demonstrate relative improvements of 28.3%, 19.6%, and 22.6% over the current best self-supervised methods, thereby advancing the frontiers of SV technology.

Title: Improving Noise Robustness of LLM-based Zero-shot TTS via Discrete Acoustic Token Denoising
Authors: Ye-Xin Lu, Hui-Peng Du, Fei Liu, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods tend to preserve the acoustic environment of the audio prompt, leading to degradation in synthesized speech quality when the audio prompt contains noise. In this paper, we propose a novel neural codec-based speech denoiser and integrate it with the advanced LLM-based TTS model, LauraTTS, to achieve noise-robust zero-shot TTS. The proposed codec denoiser consists of an audio codec, a token denoiser, and an embedding refiner. The token denoiser predicts the first two groups of clean acoustic tokens from the noisy ones, which can serve as the acoustic prompt for LauraTTS to synthesize high-quality personalized speech or be converted to clean speech waveforms through the embedding refiner and codec decoder. Experimental results show that our proposed codec denoiser outperforms state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) methods, and the proposed noise-robust LauraTTS surpasses the approach using additional SE models.

Title: On the Input-Output Monotonicity of Voltage Dynamics of Power System with Grid-Forming Converters
Authors: Zhenyao Li, Shengwen Liao, Qian Zhang, Xuechun Zhang, Deqiang Gan
Abstract: Integration of renewable resources is profoundly reshaping the dynamics of modern power systems. This study shows that the voltage dynamics of power systems with multiple grid-forming (GFM) converters often enjoys a desirable property called input-output monotonicity. A systematic approach for computing the derivatives of the voltage subsystem is presented first, which provides insight into the structural characteristics of these models. Next, the sign pattern of the trajectory Jacobian matrix associated with the voltage subsystem is analyzed and revealed. The analysis indicates that the voltage dynamics of power systems often exhibits the so-called input-output monotonicity property. The theoretical results are then validated through several simulation examples, underscoring their practical implications.

Title: Exploring Image Quality Assessment from a New Perspective: Pupil Size
Authors: Yixuan Gao, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: This paper explores how the image quality assessment (IQA) task affects the cognitive processes of people from the perspective of pupil size and studies the relationship between pupil size and image quality. Specifically, we first invited subjects to participate in a subjective experiment, which includes two tasks: free observation and IQA. In the free observation task, subjects did not need to perform any action, and they only needed to observe images as they usually do with an album. In the IQA task, subjects were required to score images according to their overall impression of image quality. Then, by analyzing the difference in pupil size between the two tasks, we find that people may activate the visual attention mechanism when evaluating image quality. Meanwhile, we also find that the change in pupil size is closely related to image quality in the IQA task. For future research on IQA, this research can not only provide a theoretical basis for the objective IQA method and promote the development of more effective objective IQA methods, but also provide a new subjective IQA method for collecting the authentic subjective impression of image quality.

Title: A Semantic Information-based Hierarchical Speech Enhancement Method Using Factorized Codec and Diffusion Model
Authors: Yang Xiang, Canan Huang, Desheng Hu, Jingguang Tian, Xinhui Hu, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Most current speech enhancement (SE) methods recover clean speech from noisy inputs by directly estimating time-frequency masks or spectrums. However, these approaches often neglect the distinct attributes, such as semantic content and acoustic details, inherent in speech signals, which can hinder performance in downstream tasks. Moreover, their effectiveness tends to degrade in complex acoustic environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel, semantic information-based, step-by-step factorized SE method using factorized codec and diffusion model. Unlike traditional SE methods, our hierarchical modeling of semantic and acoustic attributes enables more robust clean speech recovery, particularly in challenging acoustic scenarios. Moreover, this method offers further advantages for downstream TTS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm not only outperforms SOTA baselines in terms of speech quality but also enhances TTS performance in noisy environments.

Title: Generalizable Learning for Frequency-Domain Channel Extrapolation under Distribution Shift
Authors: Haoyu Wang, Zhi Sun, Shuangfeng Han, Xiaoyun Wang, Zhaocheng Wang
Abstract: Frequency-domain channel extrapolation is effective in reducing pilot overhead for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Recently, Deep learning (DL) based channel extrapolator has become a promising candidate for modeling complex frequency-domain dependency. Nevertheless, current DL extrapolators fail to operate in unseen environments under distribution shift, which poses challenges for large-scale deployment. In this paper, environment generalizable learning for channel extrapolation is achieved by realizing distribution alignment from a physics perspective. Firstly, the distribution shift of wireless channels is rigorously analyzed, which comprises the distribution shift of multipath structure and single-path response. Secondly, a physics-based progressive distribution alignment strategy is proposed to address the distribution shift, which includes successive path-oriented design and path alignment. Path-oriented DL extrapolator decomposes multipath channel extrapolation into parallel extrapolations of the extracted path, which can mitigate the distribution shift of multipath structure. Path alignment is proposed to address the distribution shift of single-path response in path-oriented DL extrapolators, which eventually enables generalizable learning for channel extrapolation. In the simulation, distinct wireless environments are generated using the precise ray-tracing tool. Based on extensive evaluations, the proposed path-oriented DL extrapolator with path alignment can reduce extrapolation error by more than 6 dB in unseen environments compared to the state-of-the-arts.

Title: Automated Quality Evaluation of Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images Based on Content Analysis
Authors: Lanlan Kang, Jian Wang, Jian QIn, Yiqin Liang, Yongjun He
Abstract: The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS) diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in terms of speed and consistency.

Title: U-SAM: An audio language Model for Unified Speech, Audio, and Music Understanding
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Xianjun Xia, Xinfa Zhu, Lei Xie
Abstract: The text generation paradigm for audio tasks has opened new possibilities for unified audio understanding. However, existing models face significant challenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio types, such as speech, general audio events, and music. Furthermore, their exclusive reliance on cross-entropy loss for alignment often falls short, as it treats all tokens equally and fails to account for redundant audio features, leading to weaker cross-modal alignment. To deal with the above challenges, this paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates specialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large language model (LLM). U-SAM employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector for task-aware feature fusion, dynamically routing and integrating the domain-specific encoder outputs. Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a Semantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant audio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and spectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized models and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, it exhibits emergent capabilities on unseen tasks, showcasing its generalization potential. Code is available (this https URL).

Title: XDementNET: An Explainable Attention Based Deep Convolutional Network to Detect Alzheimer Progression from MRI data
Authors: Soyabul Islam Lincoln, Mirza Mohd Shahriar Maswood
Abstract: A common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease requires a precise diagnosis and efficient treatment, particularly in light of escalating healthcare expenses and the expanding use of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics. Many recent studies shows that the combination of brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and deep neural networks have achieved promising results for diagnosing AD. Using deep convolutional neural networks, this paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates multiresidual blocks, specialized spatial attention blocks, grouped query attention, and multi-head attention. The study assessed the model's performance on four publicly accessible datasets and concentrated on identifying binary and multiclass issues across various categories. This paper also takes into account of the explainability of AD's progression and compared with state-of-the-art methods namely Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), Score-CAM, Faster Score-CAM, and XGRADCAM. Our methodology consistently outperforms current approaches, achieving 99.66\% accuracy in 4-class classification, 99.63\% in 3-class classification, and 100\% in binary classification using Kaggle datasets. For Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets the accuracies are 99.92\%, 99.90\%, and 99.95\% respectively. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset was used for experiments in three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) and a combination of all planes. The study achieved accuracies of 99.08\% for axis, 99.85\% for sagittal, 99.5\% for coronal, and 99.17\% for all axis, and 97.79\% and 8.60\% respectively for ADNI-2. The network's ability to retrieve important information from MRI images is demonstrated by its excellent accuracy in categorizing AD stages.

Title: Bronchovascular Tree-Guided Weakly Supervised Learning Method for Pulmonary Segment Segmentation

Abstract: Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method, termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments, ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree. Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment, ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Waveform for Next Generation Communication Systems: Comparing Zak-OTFS with OFDM
Authors: Imran Ali Khan, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank, Anton Monk, Shachar Kons, Shlomo Rakib, Yoav Hebron
Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.

Title: Naturalness-Aware Curriculum Learning with Dynamic Temperature for Speech Deepfake Detection
Authors: Taewoo Kim, Guisik Kim, Choongsang Cho, Young Han Lee
Abstract: Recent advances in speech deepfake detection (SDD) have significantly improved artifacts-based detection in spoofed speech. However, most models overlook speech naturalness, a crucial cue for distinguishing bona fide speech from spoofed speech. This study proposes naturalness-aware curriculum learning, a novel training framework that leverages speech naturalness to enhance the robustness and generalization of SDD. This approach measures sample difficulty using both ground-truth labels and mean opinion scores, and adjusts the training schedule to progressively introduce more challenging samples. To further improve generalization, a dynamic temperature scaling method based on speech naturalness is incorporated into the training process. A 23% relative reduction in the EER was achieved in the experiments on the ASVspoof 2021 DF dataset, without modifying the model architecture. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of naturalness-aware training strategies for SDD tasks.

Title: End-to-end Cortical Surface Reconstruction from Clinical Magnetic Resonance Images
Authors: Jesper Duemose Nielsen, Karthik Gopinath, Andrew Hoopes, Adrian Dalca, Colin Magdamo, Steven Arnold, Sudeshna Das, Axel Thielscher, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, Oula Puonti
Abstract: Surface-based cortical analysis is valuable for a variety of neuroimaging tasks, such as spatial normalization, parcellation, and gray matter (GM) thickness estimation. However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work exclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This precludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very heterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic domain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit estimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution, without retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM) surface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further deformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to recon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is currently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR scans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately 50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect to RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns detected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans. Our method enables fast and accurate surface reconstruction of clinical scans, allowing studies (1) with sample sizes far beyond what is feasible in a research setting, and (2) of clinical populations that are difficult to enroll in research studies. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Near-Field RIS-Assisted Localization Under Mutual Coupling
Authors: Alireza Fadakar, Musa Furkan Keskin, Hui Chen, Henk Wymeersch, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have the potential to significantly enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS) blockage scenarios. However, as larger RISs are integrated into ISAC systems, mutual coupling (MC) effects between RIS elements become more pronounced, leading to a substantial degradation in performance, especially for localization applications. In this paper, we first conduct a misspecified and standard Cramér-Rao bound analysis to quantify the impact of MC on localization performance, demonstrating severe degradations in accuracy, especially when MC is ignored. Building on this, we propose a novel joint user equipment localization and RIS MC parameter estimation (JLMC) method in near-field wireless systems. Our two-stage MC-aware approach outperforms classical methods that neglect MC, significantly improving localization accuracy and overall system performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in realistic scenarios.

Title: NOVA: A Benchmark for Anomaly Localization and Clinical Reasoning in Brain MRI

Abstract: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel conditions encountered in clinical use. We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$ benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an $extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks, establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect, localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

Title: SeamlessEdit: Background Noise Aware Zero-Shot Speech Editing with in-Context Enhancement
Authors: Kuan-Yu Chen, Jeng-Lin Li, Jian-Jiun Ding
Abstract: With the fast development of zero-shot text-to-speech technologies, it is possible to generate high-quality speech signals that are indistinguishable from the real ones. Speech editing, including speech insertion and replacement, appeals to researchers due to its potential applications. However, existing studies only considered clean speech scenarios. In real-world applications, the existence of environmental noise could significantly degrade the quality of the generation. In this study, we propose a noise-resilient speech editing framework, SeamlessEdit, for noisy speech editing. SeamlessEdit adopts a frequency-band-aware noise suppression module and an in-content refinement strategy. It can well address the scenario where the frequency bands of voice and background noise are not separated. The proposed SeamlessEdit framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multiple quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Title: AI-empowered Channel Estimation for Block-based Active IRS-enhanced Hybrid-field IoT Network
Authors: Yan Wang, Feng Shu, Xianpeng Wang, Minghao Chen, Riqing Chen, Liang Yang, Junhui Zhao
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation (CE) for uplink hybrid-field communications involving multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices assisted by an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is investigated. Firstly, to reduce the complexity of near-field (NF) channel modeling and estimation between IoT devices and active IRS, a sub-blocking strategy for active IRS is proposed. Specifically, the entire active IRS is divided into multiple smaller sub-blocks, so that IoT devices are located in the far-field (FF) region of each sub block, while also being located in the NF region of the entire active IRS. This strategy significantly simplifies the channel model and reduces the parameter estimation dimension by decoupling the high-dimensional NF channel parameter space into low dimensional FF sub channels. Subsequently, the relationship between channel approximation error and CE error with respect to the number of sub blocks is derived, and the optimal number of sub blocks is solved based on the criterion of minimizing the total error. In addition, considering that the amplification capability of active IRS requires power consumption, a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation factor is derived. To further reduce the pilot overhead, a lightweight CE algorithm based on convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and multi-head attention mechanism, called CAEformer, is designed. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed CAEformer network significantly outperforms the conventional least square and minimum mean square error scheme in terms of estimation accuracy.

Title: EM-Based Channel Estimation for mMIMO LEO SATCOM Under Imperfect Doppler Compensation
Authors: Abdollah Masoud Darya, Saeed Abdallah
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output low-Earth-orbit communication channels are highly time-varying due to severe Doppler shifts and propagation delays. While satellite-mobility-induced Doppler shifts can be compensated using known ephemeris data, those caused by user mobility require accurate user positioning information; the absence of such information contributes to amplified channel aging in conventional channel estimators. To address this challenge, we propose a data-aided channel estimator based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, combined with a discrete Legendre polynomial basis expansion method (DLP-BEM), to estimate the channel under imperfect Doppler compensation. The EM algorithm iteratively exploits hidden data symbols for improved channel estimation, while DLP-BEM regularizes the process by projecting the channel estimate onto a lower dimensional subspace that mitigates estimation errors. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over existing methods in terms of normalized mean square error and symbol error rate.

Title: Gaming Strategies in European Imbalance Settlement Mechanisms
Authors: Seyed Soroush Karimi Madahi, Kenneth Bruninx, Bert Claessens, Chris Develder
Abstract: Transmission System Operators (TSOs) rely on balancing energy provided by Balancing Service Providers (BSPs) to maintain the supply-demand balance in real time. Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) can simultaneously deviate from their day-ahead schedules in response to imbalance prices, e.g., by controlling flexible assets such as batteries. According to the European Electricity Balancing Guideline, these imbalance prices should incentivize BRPs performing such implicit or passive balancing to aid the TSO in restoring the energy balance. In this paper, we demonstrate that BRPs are unintentionally offered the opportunity to exploit gaming strategies in European imbalance settlement mechanisms. This is enabled by a disconnect between sub-quarter-hourly dynamics that determine the imbalance prices and the financial settlement on a quarter-hourly basis. We illustrate this behavior in a case study of the imbalance settlement mechanisms in Belgium and the Netherlands. Our results reveal that, in both countries, BRPs can, in theory, exploit the imbalance mechanism by increasing the instantaneous system imbalance during minutes within the quarter-hour that determine the imbalance price while still contributing to restoring the system balance for the rest of the quarter-hour.

Title: Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM) for Extremely Robust Physical Layer Encryption
Authors: Thrassos K. Oikonomou, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: This paper introduces Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM), a novel modulation scheme that can be leveraged to effectively shuffle transmitted data while maintaining symbol error probability (SEP) performance equivalent to unencrypted systems. By utilizing the well-distributed elliptic curve points over the field of large primes, ECM enhances symbol obfuscation, making it a powerful foundation for physical-layer encryption (PLE). Each symbol is mapped from a predefined key while preserving a minimum Euclidean distance constraint, ensuring strong security against adversarial inference without compromising error performance. Building on ECM's strong obfuscation capabilities, we propose ECM with dynamic rotation (ECM-DR) as a practical PLE scheme that achieves near-maximal obfuscation while balancing precomputation complexity. By leveraging a reduced subset of precomputed elliptic curve points and key-based dynamic constellation rotation, ECM-DR ensures that each transmission remains unpredictable, significantly enhancing security compared to traditional PLE schemes without additional computational cost. Security analysis confirms ECM's resilience to brute-force attacks, while numerical results demonstrate its strong obfuscation capabilities. Furthermore, ECM-DR achieves near-maximum information entropy while preserving the SEP performance of unencrypted quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), offering an extremely robust solution for secure wireless communications.

Title: Statistically Optimal Structured Additive MIMO Continuous-time System Identification
Authors: Rodrigo A. González, Maarten van der Hulst, Koen Classens, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Many applications in mechanical, acoustic, and electronic engineering require estimating complex dynamical models, often represented as additive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transfer functions with structural constraints. This paper introduces a two-stage procedure for estimating structured additive MIMO models, where structural constraints are enforced through a weighted nonlinear least-squares projection of the parameter vector initially estimated using a recently developed refined instrumental variables algorithm. The proposed approach is shown to be consistent and asymptotically efficient in open-loop scenarios. In closed-loop settings, it remains consistent despite potential noise model misspecification and achieves minimum covariance among all instrumental variable estimators. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the theoretical findings, and to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: Functional Controllability, Functional Stabilisability, and the Generalised Separation Principle
Authors: Tyrone Fernando, Mohamed Darouach
Abstract: This paper introduces the new concepts of Functional Controllability and Functional Stabilisability, and establishes their duality with Functional Observability and Functional Detectability, respectively. We further present a Generalised Separation Principle, demonstrating that the classical Separation Principle emerges as a special case. Conditions for the existence of functional controllers of a specified order are derived. Importantly, the design framework does not require full controllability. Furthermore, we develop a functional observer-based controller design applicable to systems that are both uncontrollable and unobservable. The results presented generalise the classical full-state feedback control paradigm.

Title: Outage Probability Analysis of Tunable Liquid Lens-assisted VLC Systems
Authors: Kapila W. S. Palitharathna, Constantinos Psomas, Ioannis Krikidis
Abstract: This paper presents a tunable liquid lens (TLL)-assisted indoor mobile visible light communication system. To mitigate performance degradation caused by user mobility and random receiver orientation, an electrowetting cuboid TLL is used at the receiver. By dynamically controlling the orientation angle of the liquid surface through voltage adjustments, signal reception and overall system performance are enhanced. An accurate mathematical framework is developed to model channel gains, and two lens optimization strategies, namely ($i$) the best signal reception (BSR), and ($ii$) the vertically upward lens orientation (VULO) are introduced for improved performance. Closed form expressions for the outage probability are derived for each scheme for practical mobility and receiver orientation conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TLL and lens adjustment strategies significantly reduce the outage probability compared to fixed lens and no lens receivers across various mobility and orientation conditions. Specifically, the outage probability is improved from $1\times 10^{-1}$ to $3\times 10^{-3}$ at a transmit power of $12$ dBW under a $8^{\circ}$ polar angle variation in random receiver orientation using the BSR scheme.

Title: A Data-Driven Method to Identify IBRs with Dominant Participation in Sub-Synchronous Oscillations
Authors: Youhong Chen, Debraj Bhattacharjee, Balarko Chaudhuri
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven (i.e., model-free) approach to identify which inverter-based resources (IBRs) have dominant participation in poorly damped sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO), to get to the root cause for effective mitigation. An Enhanced Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) method is proposed that incorporates an appropriate set of observables. Based on time-synchronized data (either simulated or real) from IBR connection points, eDMD directly computes data-driven eigenvectors and participation factors to reveal the role of each IBR in poorly damped SSO. We show the improved accuracy of eDMD over conventional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by benchmarking both against actual model-based analysis. We demonstrate this first through a synthetic example and then a case study on the IEEE 39-bus test system with 100% IBR. This data-driven, model-free method offers a powerful tool to foresee and mitigate the risk of IBR-induced SSO in planning (simulated data) and post-event analysis (real data) of SSO events.

Title: A precise detection method for transient micro short-circuit faults of lithium-ion batteries through signal processing
Authors: Hongyu Zhao, Yangyang Xu, Chenglin Liao
Abstract: A specific failure mode designated as transient micro-short circuit (TMSC) has been identified in practical battery systems, exhibiting subtle and latent characteristics with measurable voltage deviations. To further improve the safe use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), this letter introduces a novel method for the precise detection of this TMSC faults within LIBs. The method applies the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to voltage and current signals, followed by the identification of micro-scale anomalies through the analysis of the coherence in the wavelet spectrum at specific frequency. Through designed fault experiments, the effec-tiveness of this method has been verified. Result demon-strates that it can effectively capture micro-faults with a voltage drop as low as 30 mV within just a few seconds. Furthermore, the proposed method is inherently highly robust and is able to effectively detect false faults and hidden faults under varying current loads, which highlights the superiority of this method.

Title: Scaling and Enhancing LLM-based AVSR: A Sparse Mixture of Projectors Approach
Authors: Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Stavros Petridis, Daniele Falavigna, Alessio Brutti
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) enhances robustness in noisy environments by integrating visual cues. While recent advances integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into AVSR, their high computational cost hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors, Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR (Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise robustness.

Title: Pairwise Evaluation of Accent Similarity in Speech Synthesis
Authors: Jinzuomu Zhong, Suyuan Liu, Dan Wells, Korin Richmond
Abstract: Despite growing interest in generating high-fidelity accents, evaluating accent similarity in speech synthesis has been underexplored. We aim to enhance both subjective and objective evaluation methods for accent similarity. Subjectively, we refine the XAB listening test by adding components that achieve higher statistical significance with fewer listeners and lower costs. Our method involves providing listeners with transcriptions, having them highlight perceived accent differences, and implementing meticulous screening for reliability. Objectively, we utilise pronunciation-related metrics, based on distances between vowel formants and phonetic posteriorgrams, to evaluate accent generation. Comparative experiments reveal that these metrics, alongside accent similarity, speaker similarity, and Mel Cepstral Distortion, can be used. Moreover, our findings underscore significant limitations of common metrics like Word Error Rate in assessing underrepresented accents.

Title: Single-Channel Target Speech Extraction Utilizing Distance and Room Clues
Authors: Runwu Shi, Zirui Lin, Benjamin Yen, Jiang Wang, Ragib Amin Nihal, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: This paper aims to achieve single-channel target speech extraction (TSE) in enclosures utilizing distance clues and room information. Recent works have verified the feasibility of distance clues for the TSE task, which can imply the sound source's direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR) and thus can be utilized for speech separation and TSE systems. However, such distance clue is significantly influenced by the room's acoustic characteristics, such as dimension and reverberation time, making it challenging for TSE systems that rely solely on distance clues to generalize across a variety of different rooms. To solve this, we suggest providing room environmental information (room dimensions and reverberation time) for distance-based TSE for better generalization capabilities. Especially, we propose a distance and environment-based TSE model in the time-frequency (TF) domain with learnable distance and room embedding. Results on both simulated and real collected datasets demonstrate its feasibility. Demonstration materials are available at this https URL.

Title: Efficient Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC via Variables Restriction and Template Selection
Authors: Filippo Badalamenti, Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Mario Eduardo Villanueva, Boris Houska, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: Configuration-Constrained Tube Model Predictive Control (CCTMPC) offers flexibility by using a polytopic parameterization of invariant sets and the optimization of an associated vertex control law. This flexibility, however, often demands computational trade-offs between set parameterization accuracy and optimization complexity. This paper proposes two innovations that help the user tackle this trade-off. First, a structured framework is proposed, which strategically limits optimization degrees of freedom, significantly reducing online computation time while retaining stability guarantees. This framework aligns with Homothetic Tube MPC (HTMPC) under maximal constraints. Second, a template refinement algorithm that iteratively solves quadratic programs is introduced to balance polytope complexity and conservatism. Simulation studies on an illustrative benchmark problem as well as a high-dimensional ten-state system demonstrate the approach's efficiency, achieving robust performance with minimal computational overhead. The results validate a practical pathway to leveraging CCTMPC's adaptability without sacrificing real-time viability.

Title: Mitigating Subgroup Disparities in Multi-Label Speech Emotion Recognition: A Pseudo-Labeling and Unsupervised Learning Approach
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI) module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness metrics by over 33% with less than a 3% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the unsupervised IDI yields more than a 26% improvement in fairness metrics with a drop of less than 4% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating its potential in scenarios where explicit demographic information is unavailable.

Title: FlowTSE: Target Speaker Extraction with Flow Matching
Authors: Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian, Yael Segal-Feldman, Neta Glazer, Gil Hetz, Joseph Keshet
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a specific speaker's speech from a mixture using speaker enrollment as a reference. While most existing approaches are discriminative, recent generative methods for TSE achieve strong results. However, generative methods for TSE remain underexplored, with most existing approaches relying on complex pipelines and pretrained components, leading to computational overhead. In this work, we present FlowTSE, a simple yet effective TSE approach based on conditional flow matching. Our model receives an enrollment audio sample and a mixed speech signal, both represented as mel-spectrograms, with the objective of extracting the target speaker's clean speech. Furthermore, for tasks where phase reconstruction is crucial, we propose a novel vocoder conditioned on the complex STFT of the mixed signal, enabling improved phase estimation. Experimental results on standard TSE benchmarks show that FlowTSE matches or outperforms strong baselines.

Title: Security of Distributed Gradient Descent Against Byzantine Agents
Authors: Sribalaji C. Anand, Nicola Bastianello
Abstract: This paper investigates the security of Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) algorithms on undirected graphs. Specifically, we consider Byzantine agents that inject stealthy attacks to degrade the performance of the DGD algorithm in terms of its optimal value. To mitigate the effect of stealthy attacks, some agents are allocated to monitor the evolution of their gradient. We then propose a method to quantify the maximum deviation caused by the Byzantine agent in the optimal value of the DGD. Our approach serves as a security metric to evaluate the robustness of graph structures against Byzantine attacks. We validate our findings through numerical simulations.

Title: A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech
Authors: Simon Geirnaert, Simon L. Kappel, Preben Kidmose
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.

Title: Comparison of Data-Driven Modeling Approaches for Control Optimization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines
Authors: Athul K. Sundarrajan, Daniel R. Herber
Abstract: Models that balance accuracy against computational costs are advantageous when designing wind turbines with optimization studies, as several hundred predictive function evaluations might be necessary to identify the optimal solution. We explore different approaches to construct low-fidelity models that can be used to approximate dynamic quantities and be used as surrogates for design optimization studies and other use cases. In particular, low-fidelity modeling approaches using classical systems identification and deep learning approaches are considered against derivative function surrogate models ({DFSMs}), or approximate models of the state derivative function. This work proposes a novel method that utilizes a linear parameter varying (LPV) modeling scheme to construct the DFSM. We compare the trade-offs between these different models and explore the efficacy of the proposed DFSM approach in approximating wind turbine performance and design optimization studies for controllers. Results show that the proposed DFSM approach balances computational time and model accuracy better than the system identification and deep learning based models. Additionally, the DFSM provides nearly a fifty times speed-up compared to the high-fidelity model, while balancing accuracy.

Title: Steering Deep Non-Linear Spatially Selective Filters for Weakly Guided Extraction of Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios
Authors: Jakob Kienegger, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: Recent speaker extraction methods using deep non-linear spatial filtering perform exceptionally well when the target direction is known and stationary. However, spatially dynamic scenarios are considerably more challenging due to time-varying spatial features and arising ambiguities, e.g. when moving speakers cross. While in a static scenario it may be easy for a user to point to the target's direction, manually tracking a moving speaker is impractical. Instead of relying on accurate time-dependent directional cues, which we refer to as strong guidance, in this paper we propose a weakly guided extraction method solely depending on the target's initial position to cope with spatial dynamic scenarios. By incorporating our own deep tracking algorithm and developing a joint training strategy on a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the proficiency of our approach in resolving spatial ambiguities and even outperform a mismatched, but strongly guided extraction method.

Title: Teaching Audio-Aware Large Language Models What Does Not Hear: Mitigating Hallucinations through Synthesized Negative Samples
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) enable them to process and understand audio inputs. However, these models often hallucinate non-existent sound events, reducing their reliability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method that enhances ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds using synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is more efficient in both data and computation.

Title: Neural Video Compression with Context Modulation
Authors: Chuanbo Tang, Zhuoyuan Li, Yifan Bian, Li Li, Dong Liu
Abstract: Efficient video coding is highly dependent on exploiting the temporal redundancy, which is usually achieved by extracting and leveraging the temporal context in the emerging conditional coding-based neural video codec (NVC). Although the latest NVC has achieved remarkable progress in improving the compression performance, the inherent temporal context propagation mechanism lacks the ability to sufficiently leverage the reference information, limiting further improvement. In this paper, we address the limitation by modulating the temporal context with the reference frame in two steps. Specifically, we first propose the flow orientation to mine the inter-correlation between the reference frame and prediction frame for generating the additional oriented temporal context. Moreover, we introduce the context compensation to leverage the oriented context to modulate the propagated temporal context generated from the propagated reference feature. Through the synergy mechanism and decoupling loss supervision, the irrelevant propagated information can be effectively eliminated to ensure better context modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec achieves on average 22.7% bitrate reduction over the advanced traditional video codec H.266/VVC, and offers an average 10.1% bitrate saving over the previous state-of-the-art NVC DCVC-FM. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Neural Inverse Scattering with Score-based Regularization
Authors: Yuan Gao, Wenhan Guo, Yu Sun
Abstract: Inverse scattering is a fundamental challenge in many imaging applications, ranging from microscopy to remote sensing. Solving this problem often requires jointly estimating two unknowns -- the image and the scattering field inside the object -- necessitating effective image prior to regularize the inference. In this paper, we propose a regularized neural field (NF) approach which integrates the denoising score function used in score-based generative models. The neural field formulation offers convenient flexibility to performing joint estimation, while the denoising score function imposes the rich structural prior of images. Our results on three high-contrast simulated objects show that the proposed approach yields a better imaging quality compared to the state-of-the-art NF approach, where regularization is based on total variation.

Title: SSPS: Self-Supervised Positive Sampling for Robust Self-Supervised Speaker Verification
Authors: Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker. This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck: Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

Title: Automated Fetal Biometry Assessment with Deep Ensembles using Sparse-Sampling of 2D Intrapartum Ultrasound Images
Authors: Jayroop Ramesh, Valentin Bacher, Mark C. Eid, Hoda Kalabizadeh, Christian Rupprecht, Ana IL Namburete, Pak-Hei Yeung, Madeleine K.Wyburd, Nicola K. Dinsdale
Abstract: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US) Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC: 0.9452, F1: 0.9225, AUC: 0.983, MCC: 0.8361, DSC: 0.918, HD: 19.73, ASD: 5.71, $\Delta_{AoP}$: 8.90 and $\Delta_{HSD}$: 14.35 across an unseen hold-out set of 4 patients and 224 US frames. The results from the proposed automated pipeline can improve the understanding of labour arrest causes and guide the development of clinical risk stratification tools for efficient and effective prenatal care.

Title: Development of a Scaled Setup for Experimental Study of the Effect of Lateral Dynamics on Energy Consumption in Electric Vehicles: An Extension
Authors: Simran Kumari, Anand Ronald K., Siddhartha Mukhopadhyay, Ashish R. Hota
Abstract: Most of the existing state-of-the-art approaches for energy consumption analysis do not account for the effect of lateral dynamics on energy consumption in electric vehicles (EVs) during vehicle maneuvers. This paper aims to validate this effect through an experimental study. We develop a scaled model using a radio-controlled (RC) car, modified to achieve dynamic similitude with on-road vehicles, to conduct scaled experiments. The experimental results confirm the impact of lateral dynamics on both energy demand and driving range in electric vehicles, aligning with our previous findings [1], and emphasize the need to incorporate these factors into energy consumption models.

Title: Performance Optimization of Energy-Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks Using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Deemah H. Tashman, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach, the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.

Title: AdaKWS: Towards Robust Keyword Spotting with Test-Time Adaptation
Authors: Yang Xiao, Tianyi Peng, Yanghao Zhou, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: Spoken keyword spotting (KWS) aims to identify keywords in audio for wide applications, especially on edge devices. Current small-footprint KWS systems focus on efficient model designs. However, their inference performance can decline in unseen environments or noisy backgrounds. Test-time adaptation (TTA) helps models adapt to test samples without needing the original training data. In this study, we present AdaKWS, the first TTA method for robust KWS to the best of our knowledge. Specifically, 1) We initially optimize the model's confidence by selecting reliable samples based on prediction entropy minimization and adjusting the normalization statistics in each batch. 2) We introduce pseudo-keyword consistency (PKC) to identify critical, reliable features without overfitting to noise. Our experiments show that AdaKWS outperforms other methods across various conditions, including Gaussian noise and real-scenario noises. The code will be released in due course.

Title: Listen, Analyze, and Adapt to Learn New Attacks: An Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning Method for Audio Deepfake Source Tracing
Authors: Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: As deepfake speech becomes common and hard to detect, it is vital to trace its source. Recent work on audio deepfake source tracing (ST) aims to find the origins of synthetic or manipulated speech. However, ST models must adapt to learn new deepfake attacks while retaining knowledge of the previous ones. A major challenge is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose the ability to recognize previously learned attacks. Some continual learning methods help with deepfake detection, but multi-class tasks such as ST introduce additional challenges as the number of classes grows. To address this, we propose an analytic class incremental learning method called AnaST. When new attacks appear, the feature extractor remains fixed, and the classifier is updated with a closed-form analytical solution in one epoch. This approach ensures data privacy, optimizes memory usage, and is suitable for online training. The experiments carried out in this work show that our method outperforms the baselines.

Title: HDE-Array: Development and Validation of a New Dry Electrode Array Design to Acquire HD-sEMG for Hand Position Estimation
Authors: Giovanni Rolandino, Chiara Zangrandi, Taian Vieira, Giacinto Luigi Cerone, Brian Andrews, James J. FitzGerald
Abstract: This paper aims to introduce HDE-Array (High-Density Electrode Array), a novel dry electrode array for acquiring High-Density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) for hand position estimation through RPC-Net (Recursive Prosthetic Control Network), a neural network defined in a previous study. We aim to demonstrate the hypothesis that the position estimates returned by RPC-Net using HD-sEMG signals acquired with HDE-Array are as accurate as those obtained from signals acquired with gel electrodes. We compared the results, in terms of precision of hand position estimation by RPC-Net, using signals acquired by traditional gel electrodes and by HDE-Array. As additional validation, we performed a variance analysis to confirm that the presence of only two rows of electrodes does not result in an excessive loss of information, and we characterized the electrode-skin impedance to assess the effects of the voltage divider effect and power line interference. Performance tests indicated that RPC-Net, used with HDE-Array, achieved comparable or superior results to those observed when used with the gel electrode setup. The dry electrodes demonstrated effective performance even with a simplified setup, highlighting potential cost and usability benefits. These results suggest improvements in the accessibility and user-friendliness of upper-limb rehabilitation devices and underscore the potential of HDE-Array and RPC-Net to revolutionize control for medical and non-medical applications.

Authors: Giovanni Rolandino, Marco Gagliardi, Taian Martins, Giacinto Luigi Cerone, Brian Andrews, James J. FitzGerald
Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of RPC-Net (Recursive Prosthetic Control Network), a novel method using simple neural network architectures to translate electromyographic activity into hand position with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Methods: RPC-Net uses a regression-based approach to convert forearm electromyographic signals into hand kinematics. We tested the adaptability of the algorithm to different conditions and compared its performance with that of solutions from the academic literature. Results: RPC-Net demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in predicting hand position from electromyographic activity, outperforming other solutions with the same computational cost. Including previous position data consistently improved results across subjects and conditions. RPC-Net showed robustness against a reduction in the number of electromyography electrodes used and shorter input signals, indicating potential for further reduction in computational cost. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that RPC-Net is capable of accurately translating forearm electromyographic activity into hand position, offering a practical and adaptable tool that may be accessible in clinical settings. Significance: The development of RPC-Net represents a significant advancement. In clinical settings, its application could enable prosthetic devices to be controlled in a way that feels more natural, improving the quality of life for individuals with limb loss.

Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping, enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb), fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable for in-sensor always-on inference use cases.

Title: An Edge AI Solution for Space Object Detection
Authors: Wenxuan Zhang, Peng Hu
Abstract: Effective Edge AI for space object detection (SOD) tasks that can facilitate real-time collision assessment and avoidance is essential with the increasing space assets in near-Earth orbits. In SOD, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites must detect other objects with high precision and minimal delay. We explore an Edge AI solution based on deep-learning-based vision sensing for SOD tasks and propose a deep learning model based on Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers, Vision Transformers (ViT), and YOLOv9 framework. We evaluate the performance of these models across various realistic SOD scenarios, demonstrating their ability to detect multiple satellites with high accuracy and very low latency.

Title: Causality for Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Hugo Araujo, Hana Chockler, Mohammad Reza Mousavi, Gustavo Carvalho, Augusto Sampaio
Abstract: We present a formal theory for analysing causality in cyber-physical systems. To this end, we extend the theory of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl to cope with the continuous nature of cyber-physical systems. Based on our theory, we develop an analysis technique that is used to uncover the causes for examples of failures resulting from verification, which are represented as continuous trajectories. We develop a search-based technique to efficiently produce such causes and provide an implementation for such a technique. Moreover, we apply our solution to case studies (a suspension system and a connected platoon) and benchmark systems to evaluate its effectiveness; in the experiment, we show that we were able to detect causes for inserted faults.

Title: VocalAgent: Large Language Models for Vocal Health Diagnostics with Safety-Aware Evaluation
Authors: Yubin Kim, Taehan Kim, Wonjune Kang, Eugene Park, Joonsik Yoon, Dongjae Lee, Xin Liu, Daniel McDuff, Hyeonhoon Lee, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Won Park
Abstract: Vocal health plays a crucial role in peoples' lives, significantly impacting their communicative abilities and interactions. However, despite the global prevalence of voice disorders, many lack access to convenient diagnosis and treatment. This paper introduces VocalAgent, an audio large language model (LLM) to address these challenges through vocal health diagnosis. We leverage Qwen-Audio-Chat fine-tuned on three datasets collected in-situ from hospital patients, and present a multifaceted evaluation framework encompassing a safety assessment to mitigate diagnostic biases, cross-lingual performance analysis, and modality ablation studies. VocalAgent demonstrates superior accuracy on voice disorder classification compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Its LLM-based method offers a scalable solution for broader adoption of health diagnostics, while underscoring the importance of ethical and technical validation.

Title: FIRES: Fluid Integrated Reflecting and Emitting Surfaces
Authors: Farshad Rostami Ghadi, Kai-Kit Wong, Masoud Kaveh, F. Javier Lopez-Martinez, Chan-Byoung Chae, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This letter introduces the concept of fluid integrated reflecting and emitting surface (FIRES), which constitutes a new paradigm seamlessly integrating the flexibility of fluid-antenna systems (FASs) with the dual functionality of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). The potential of the proposed metasurface structure is studied though an FIRES-enabled multicast system based on the energy splitting protocol. In this model, the FIRES is divided into non-overlapping subareas, each functioning as a 'fluid' element capable of concurrent reflection and transmission and changing its position of radiation within the subarea. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem for the design of the triple tunable features of the surface unit elements, which is solved via a tailored particle swarm optimization approach. Our results showcase that the proposed FIRES architecture significantly outperforms its conventional STAR-RIS counterpart.

Title: Dynamic Bipedal MPC with Foot-level Obstacle Avoidance and Adjustable Step Timing
Authors: Tianze Wang, Christian Hubicki
Abstract: Collision-free planning is essential for bipedal robots operating within unstructured environments. This paper presents a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that addresses both body and foot avoidance for dynamic bipedal robots. Our contribution is two-fold: we introduce (1) a novel formulation for adjusting step timing to facilitate faster body avoidance and (2) a novel 3D foot-avoidance formulation that implicitly selects swing trajectories and footholds that either steps over or navigate around obstacles with awareness of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics. We achieve body avoidance by applying a half-space relaxation of the safe region but introduce a switching heuristic based on tracking error to detect a need to change foot-timing schedules. To enable foot avoidance and viable landing footholds on all sides of foot-level obstacles, we decompose the non-convex safe region on the ground into several convex polygons and use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming to determine the optimal candidate. We found that introducing a soft minimum-travel-distance constraint is effective in preventing the MPC from being trapped in local minima that can stall half-space relaxation methods behind obstacles. We demonstrated the proposed algorithms on multibody simulations on the bipedal robot platforms, Cassie and Digit, as well as hardware experiments on Digit.

Title: ReSW-VL: Representation Learning for Surgical Workflow Analysis Using Vision-Language Model
Authors: Satoshi Kondo
Abstract: Surgical phase recognition from video is a technology that automatically classifies the progress of a surgical procedure and has a wide range of potential applications, including real-time surgical support, optimization of medical resources, training and skill assessment, and safety improvement. Recent advances in surgical phase recognition technology have focused primarily on Transform-based methods, although methods that extract spatial features from individual frames using a CNN and video features from the resulting time series of spatial features using time series modeling have shown high performance. However, there remains a paucity of research on training methods for CNNs employed for feature extraction or representation learning in surgical phase recognition. In this study, we propose a method for representation learning in surgical workflow analysis using a vision-language model (ReSW-VL). Our proposed method involves fine-tuning the image encoder of a CLIP (Convolutional Language Image Model) vision-language model using prompt learning for surgical phase recognition. The experimental results on three surgical phase recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to conventional methods.

Title: Score-Based Training for Energy-Based TTS Models
Authors: Wanli Sun, Anton Ragni
Abstract: Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for training energy-based models (EBM) with intractable normalisation terms. The key idea of NCE is to learn by comparing unnormalised log-likelihoods of the reference and noisy samples, thus avoiding explicitly computing normalisation terms. However, NCE critically relies on the quality of noisy samples. Recently, sliced score matching (SSM) has been popularised by closely related diffusion models (DM). Unlike NCE, SSM learns a gradient of log-likelihood, or score, by learning distribution of its projections on randomly chosen directions. However, both NCE and SSM disregard the form of log-likelihood function, which is problematic given that EBMs and DMs make use of first-order optimisation during inference. This paper proposes a new criterion that learns scores more suitable for first-order schemes. Experiments contrasts these approaches for training EBMs.

Title: C*: A Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments using Rapidly Covering Graphs
Authors: Zongyuan Shen, James P. Wilson, Shalabh Gupta
Abstract: The paper presents a novel sample-based algorithm, called C*, for real-time coverage path planning (CPP) of unknown environments. The C* algorithm is built upon the concept of Rapidly Covering Graph (RCGs). The RCG is constructed incrementally via progressive sampling during robot navigation, which eliminates the need for cellular decomposition of the search space. The RCG has a sparse-graph structure formed by efficient sampling and pruning techniques, which produces non-myopic waypoints of the coverage trajectory. While C* produces the desired back and forth coverage pattern, it adapts to the TSP-based locally optimal coverage of small uncovered regions, called coverage holes, that are surrounded by obstacles and covered regions. Thus, C* proactively detects and covers the coverage holes in situ, which reduces the coverage time by preventing the longer return trajectories from distant regions to cover such holes later. The algorithmic simplicity and low computational complexity of C* makes it easy to implement and suitable for real-time onboard applications. It is analytically proven that C* provides complete coverage of unknown environments. The performance of C* is validated by 1) extensive high-fidelity simulations and 2) real laboratory experiments using autonomous robots. A comparative evaluation with seven existing CPP methods demonstrate that C* yields significant performance improvements in terms of coverage time, number of turns, trajectory length and overlap ratio, while preventing the formation of coverage holes. Finally, C* is evaluated on two different applications of CPP using 1) energy-constrained robots and 2) multi-robot teams.

Title: ClapFM-EVC: High-Fidelity and Flexible Emotional Voice Conversion with Dual Control from Natural Language and Speech
Authors: Yu Pan, Yanni Hu, Yuguang Yang, Jixun Yao, Jianhao Ye, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao
Abstract: Despite great advances, achieving high-fidelity emotional voice conversion (EVC) with flexible and interpretable control remains challenging. This paper introduces ClapFM-EVC, a novel EVC framework capable of generating high-quality converted speech driven by natural language prompts or reference speech with adjustable emotion intensity. We first propose EVC-CLAP, an emotional contrastive language-audio pre-training model, guided by natural language prompts and categorical labels, to extract and align fine-grained emotional elements across speech and text modalities. Then, a FuEncoder with an adaptive intensity gate is presented to seamless fuse emotional features with Phonetic PosteriorGrams from a pre-trained ASR model. To further improve emotion expressiveness and speech naturalness, we propose a flow matching model conditioned on these captured features to reconstruct Mel-spectrogram of source speech. Subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of ClapFM-EVC.

Title: Forensic deepfake audio detection using segmental speech features
Authors: Tianle Yang, Chengzhe Sun, Siwei Lyu, Phil Rose
Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection differently for forensic voice comparison and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.

Title: Blind Restoration of High-Resolution Ultrasound Video
Authors: Chu Chen, Kangning Cui, Pasquale Cascarano, Wei Tang, Elena Loli Piccolomini, Raymond H. Chan
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in clinical practice, yet ultrasound videos often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited resolutions, posing challenges for diagnosis and analysis. Variations in equipment and acquisition settings can further exacerbate differences in data distribution and noise levels, reducing the generalizability of pre-trained models. This work presents a self-supervised ultrasound video super-resolution algorithm called Deep Ultrasound Prior (DUP). DUP employs a video-adaptive optimization process of a neural network that enhances the resolution of given ultrasound videos without requiring paired training data while simultaneously removing noise. Quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that DUP outperforms existing super-resolution algorithms, leading to substantial improvements for downstream applications.

Title: BiCrossMamba-ST: Speech Deepfake Detection with Bidirectional Mamba Spectro-Temporal Cross-Attention
Authors: Yassine El Kheir, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian Möller
Abstract: We propose BiCrossMamba-ST, a robust framework for speech deepfake detection that leverages a dual-branch spectro-temporal architecture powered by bidirectional Mamba blocks and mutual cross-attention. By processing spectral sub-bands and temporal intervals separately and then integrating their representations, BiCrossMamba-ST effectively captures the subtle cues of synthetic speech. In addition, our proposed framework leverages a convolution-based 2D attention map to focus on specific spectro-temporal regions, enabling robust deepfake detection. Operating directly on raw features, BiCrossMamba-ST achieves significant performance improvements, a 67.74% and 26.3% relative gain over state-of-the-art AASIST on ASVSpoof LA21 and ASVSpoof DF21 benchmarks, respectively, and a 6.80% improvement over RawBMamba on ASVSpoof DF21. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Title: The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) 2025 Challenge: Audio-Visual Diarization and Recognition
Authors: Ming Gao, Shilong Wu, Hang Chen, Jun Du, Chin-Hui Lee, Shinji Watanabe, Jingdong Chen, Siniscalchi Sabato Marco, Odette Scharenborg
Abstract: Meetings are a valuable yet challenging scenario for speech applications due to complex acoustic conditions. This paper summarizes the outcomes of the MISP 2025 Challenge, hosted at Interspeech 2025, which focuses on multi-modal, multi-device meeting transcription by incorporating video modality alongside audio. The tasks include Audio-Visual Speaker Diarization (AVSD), Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR), and Audio-Visual Diarization and Recognition (AVDR). We present the challenge's objectives, tasks, dataset, baseline systems, and solutions proposed by participants. The best-performing systems achieved significant improvements over the baseline: the top AVSD model achieved a Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 8.09%, improving by 7.43%; the top AVSR system achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 9.48%, improving by 10.62%; and the best AVDR system achieved a concatenated minimum-permutation Character Error Rate (cpCER) of 11.56%, improving by 72.49%.

Title: Bridging Speech Emotion Recognition and Personality: Dataset and Temporal Interaction Condition Network
Authors: Yuan Gao, Hao Shi, Yahui Fu, Chenhui Chu, Tatsuya Kawahara
Abstract: This study investigates the interaction between personality traits and emotional expression, exploring how personality information can improve speech emotion recognition (SER). We collected personality annotation for the IEMOCAP dataset, and the statistical analysis identified significant correlations between personality traits and emotional expressions. To extract finegrained personality features, we propose a temporal interaction condition network (TICN), in which personality features are integrated with Hubert-based acoustic features for SER. Experiments show that incorporating ground-truth personality traits significantly enhances valence recognition, improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) from 0.698 to 0.785 compared to the baseline without personality information. For practical applications in dialogue systems where personality information about the user is unavailable, we develop a front-end module of automatic personality recognition. Using these automatically predicted traits as inputs to our proposed TICN model, we achieve a CCC of 0.776 for valence recognition, representing an 11.17% relative improvement over the baseline. These findings confirm the effectiveness of personality-aware SER and provide a solid foundation for further exploration in personality-aware speech processing applications.

Title: Symbolic and Numerical Tools for $L_{\infty}$-Norm Calculation
Authors: Grace Younes, Alban Quadrat, Fabrice Rouillier
Abstract: The computation of the $L_\infty $-norm is an important issue in $H_{\infty}$ control, particularly for analyzing system stability and robustness. This paper focuses on symbolic computation methods for determining the $L_{\infty} $-norm of finite-dimensional linear systems, highlighting their advantages in achieving exact solutions where numerical methods often encounter limitations. Key techniques such as Sturm-Habicht sequences, Rational Univariate Representations (RUR), and Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) are surveyed, with an emphasis on their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and specific applicability to $ L_{\infty} $-norm computation. A comparative analysis is conducted between symbolic and conventional numerical approaches, underscoring scenarios in which symbolic computation provides superior accuracy, particularly in parametric cases. Benchmark evaluations reveal the strengths and limitations of both approaches, offering insights into the trade-offs involved. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges of symbolic computation and explores future opportunities for its integration into control theory, particularly for robust and stable system analysis.

Title: Combining Deterministic Enhanced Conditions with Dual-Streaming Encoding for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Hao Shi, Xugang Lu, Kazuki Shimada, Tatsuya Kawahara
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) models need to incorporate correct prior knowledge as reliable conditions to generate accurate predictions. However, providing reliable conditions using noisy features is challenging. One solution is to use features enhanced by deterministic methods as conditions. However, the information distortion and loss caused by deterministic methods might affect the diffusion process. In this paper, we first investigate the effects of using different deterministic SE models as conditions for diffusion. We validate two conditions depending on whether the noisy feature was used as part of the condition: one using only the deterministic feature (deterministic-only), and the other using both deterministic and noisy features (deterministic-noisy). Preliminary investigation found that using deterministic enhanced conditions improves hearing experiences on real data, while the choice between using deterministic-only or deterministic-noisy conditions depends on the deterministic models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual-streaming encoding Repair-Diffusion Model for SE (DERDM-SE) to more effectively utilize both conditions. Moreover, we found that fine-grained deterministic models have greater potential in objective evaluation metrics, while UNet-based deterministic models provide more stable diffusion performance. Therefore, in the DERDM-SE, we propose a deterministic model that combines coarse- and fine-grained processing. Experimental results on CHiME4 show that the proposed models effectively leverage deterministic models to achieve better SE evaluation scores, along with more stable performance compared to other diffusion-based SE models.

Title: VeRecycle: Reclaiming Guarantees from Probabilistic Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems after Change
Authors: Sterre Lutz, Matthijs T.J. Spaan, Anna Lukina
Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in the real world encounter a range of uncertainties. Probabilistic neural Lyapunov certification is a powerful approach to proving safety of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. When faced with changes beyond the modeled uncertainties, e.g., unidentified obstacles, probabilistic certificates must be transferred to the new system dynamics. However, even when the changes are localized in a known part of the state space, state-of-the-art requires complete re-certification, which is particularly costly for neural certificates. We introduce VeRecycle, the first framework to formally reclaim guarantees for discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems. VeRecycle efficiently reuses probabilistic certificates when the system dynamics deviate only in a given subset of states. We present a general theoretical justification and algorithmic implementation. Our experimental evaluation shows scenarios where VeRecycle both saves significant computational effort and achieves competitive probabilistic guarantees in compositional neural control.

Title: Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening
Authors: Guoming Li, Jian Yang, Yifan Chen
Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.

Title: Recreating Neural Activity During Speech Production with Language and Speech Model Embeddings
Authors: Owais Mujtaba Khanday, Pablo Rodroguez San Esteban, Zubair Ahmad Lone, Marc Ouellet, Jose Andres Gonzalez Lopez
Abstract: Understanding how neural activity encodes speech and language production is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This study investigates whether embeddings from large-scale, self-supervised language and speech models can effectively reconstruct neural activity recordings captured during speech production. We leverage pre-trained embeddings from deep learning models trained on linguistic and acoustic data to represent high-level speech features and map them onto neural signals. We analyze the extent to which these embeddings preserve the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. We evaluate reconstructed neural signals against ground truth recordings using correlation metrics and signal reconstruction quality assessments. The results indicate that neural activity can be effectively reconstructed using embeddings from large language and speech models across all study participants, yielding Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99.

Title: Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics
Authors: Luca Ballotta, Nicola Bastianello, Riccardo M. G. Ferrari, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.

Title: AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: Guangke Chen, Fu Song, Zhe Zhao, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Yanchen Qiao, Weizhe Zhang
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website this https URL.

Title: AudSemThinker: Enhancing Audio-Language Models through Reasoning over Semantics of Sound
Authors: Gijs Wijngaard, Elia Formisano, Michele Esposito, Michel Dumontier
Abstract: Audio-language models have shown promising results in various sound understanding tasks, yet they remain limited in their ability to reason over the fine-grained semantics of sound. In this paper, we present AudSemThinker, a model whose reasoning is structured around a framework of auditory semantics inspired by human cognition. To support this, we introduce AudSem, a novel dataset specifically curated for semantic descriptor reasoning in audio-language models. AudSem addresses the persistent challenge of data contamination in zero-shot evaluations by providing a carefully filtered collection of audio samples paired with captions generated through a robust multi-stage pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that AudSemThinker outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple training settings, highlighting its strength in semantic audio reasoning. Both AudSemThinker and the AudSem dataset are released publicly.

Title: VaN3Twin: the Multi-Technology V2X Digital Twin with Ray-Tracing in the Loop
Authors: Roberto Pegurri, Diego Gasco, Francesco Linsalata, Marco Rapelli, Eugenio Moro, Francesco Raviglione, Claudio Casetti
Abstract: This paper presents VaN3Twin-the first open-source, full-stack Network Digital Twin (NDT) framework for simulating the coexistence of multiple Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies with accurate physical-layer modeling via ray tracing. VaN3Twin extends the ms-van3t simulator by integrating Sionna Ray Tracer (RT) in the loop, enabling high-fidelity representation of wireless propagation, including diverse Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions with focus on LoS blockage due to other vehicles' meshes, Doppler effect, and site-dependent effects-e.g., scattering and diffraction. Unlike conventional simulation tools, the proposed framework supports realistic coexistence analysis across DSRC and C-V2X technologies operating over shared spectrum. A dedicated interference tracking module captures cross-technology interference at the time-frequency resource block level and enhances signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation by eliminating artifacts such as the bimodal behavior induced by separate LoS/NLoS propagation models. Compared to field measurements, VaN3Twin reduces application-layer disagreement by 50% in rural and over 70% in urban environments with respect to current state-of-the-art simulation tools, demonstrating its value for scalable and accurate digital twin-based V2X coexistence simulation.

Title: Source Verification for Speech Deepfakes
Authors: Viola Negroni, Davide Salvi, Paolo Bestagini, Stefano Tubaro
Abstract: With the proliferation of speech deepfake generators, it becomes crucial not only to assess the authenticity of synthetic audio but also to trace its origin. While source attribution models attempt to address this challenge, they often struggle in open-set conditions against unseen generators. In this paper, we introduce the source verification task, which, inspired by speaker verification, determines whether a test track was produced using the same model as a set of reference signals. Our approach leverages embeddings from a classifier trained for source attribution, computing distance scores between tracks to assess whether they originate from the same source. We evaluate multiple models across diverse scenarios, analyzing the impact of speaker diversity, language mismatch, and post-processing operations. This work provides the first exploration of source verification, highlighting its potential and vulnerabilities, and offers insights for real-world forensic applications.

Title: MatchDance: Collaborative Mamba-Transformer Architecture Matching for High-Quality 3D Dance Synthesis
Authors: Kaixing Yang, Xulong Tang, Yuxuan Hu, Jiahao Yang, Hongyan Liu, Qinnan Zhang, Jun He, Zhaoxin Fan
Abstract: Music-to-dance generation represents a challenging yet pivotal task at the intersection of choreography, virtual reality, and creative content generation. Despite its significance, existing methods face substantial limitation in achieving choreographic consistency. To address the challenge, we propose MatchDance, a novel framework for music-to-dance generation that constructs a latent representation to enhance choreographic consistency. MatchDance employs a two-stage design: (1) a Kinematic-Dynamic-based Quantization Stage (KDQS), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) with kinematic-dynamic constraints and reconstructs them with high fidelity, and (2) a Hybrid Music-to-Dance Generation Stage(HMDGS), which uses a Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture to map music into the latent representation, followed by the KDQS decoder to generate 3D dance motions. Additionally, a music-dance retrieval framework and comprehensive metrics are introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments on the FineDance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Swarm Intelligence Optimization of Multi-RIS Aided MmWave Beamspace MIMO
Authors: Zaid Abdullah, Mario R. Camana, Abuzar B. M. Adam, Chandan K. Sheemar, Eva Lagunas, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a multiple reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) beamspace multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple users (UEs). We focus on a challenging scenario in which the direct links between the base station (BS) and all UEs are blocked, and communication is facilitated only via RISs. The maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is utilized for data precoding, while a low-complexity algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed to jointly perform beam selection, power allocation, and RIS profile configuration. The proposed optimization approach demonstrates positive trade-offs between the complexity (in terms of running time) and the achievable sum rate. In addition, our results demonstrate that due to the sparsity of beamspace channels, increasing the number of unit cells (UCs) at RISs can lead to higher achievable rates than activating a larger number of beams at the MIMO BS.

Title: AquaSignal: An Integrated Framework for Robust Underwater Acoustic Analysis
Authors: Eirini Panteli, Paulo E. Santos, Nabil Humphrey
Abstract: This paper presents AquaSignal, a modular and scalable pipeline for preprocessing, denoising, classification, and novelty detection of underwater acoustic signals. Designed to operate effectively in noisy and dynamic marine environments, AquaSignal integrates state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to enhance the reliability and accuracy of acoustic signal analysis. The system is evaluated on a combined dataset from the Deepship and Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) benchmarks, providing a diverse set of real-world underwater scenarios. AquaSignal employs a U-Net architecture for denoising, a ResNet18 convolutional neural network for classifying known acoustic events, and an AutoEncoder-based model for unsupervised detection of novel or anomalous signals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to apply and evaluate this combination of techniques on maritime vessel acoustic data. Experimental results show that AquaSignal improves signal clarity and task performance, achieving 71% classification accuracy and 91% accuracy in novelty detection. Despite slightly lower classification performance compared to some state-of-the-art models, differences in data partitioning strategies limit direct comparisons. Overall, AquaSignal demonstrates strong potential for real-time underwater acoustic monitoring in scientific, environmental, and maritime domains.

Title: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks for Flexible Control of Speech-LLMs
Authors: Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Vyas Raina, Mark Gales, Kate Knill
Abstract: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal, adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance to adversarial attacks.

Title: Towards Generating Realistic Underwater Images
Authors: Abdul-Kazeem Shamba
Abstract: This paper explores the use of contrastive learning and generative adversarial networks for generating realistic underwater images from synthetic images with uniform lighting. We investigate the performance of image translation models for generating realistic underwater images using the VAROS dataset. Two key evaluation metrics, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), provide insights into the trade-offs between perceptual quality and structural preservation. For paired image translation, pix2pix achieves the best FID scores due to its paired supervision and PatchGAN discriminator, while the autoencoder model attains the highest SSIM, suggesting better structural fidelity despite producing blurrier outputs. Among unpaired methods, CycleGAN achieves a competitive FID score by leveraging cycle-consistency loss, whereas CUT, which replaces cycle-consistency with contrastive learning, attains higher SSIM, indicating improved spatial similarity retention. Notably, incorporating depth information into CUT results in the lowest overall FID score, demonstrating that depth cues enhance realism. However, the slight decrease in SSIM suggests that depth-aware learning may introduce structural variations.

Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects-Ü-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.

Title: PersonaTAB: Predicting Personality Traits using Textual, Acoustic, and Behavioral Cues in Fully-Duplex Speech Dialogs
Authors: Sho Inoue, Shai Wang, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Despite significant progress in neural spoken dialog systems, personality-aware conversation agents -- capable of adapting behavior based on personalities -- remain underexplored due to the absence of personality annotations in speech datasets. We propose a pipeline that preprocesses raw audio recordings to create a dialogue dataset annotated with timestamps, response types, and emotion/sentiment labels. We employ an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to extract transcripts and timestamps, then generate conversation-level annotations. Leveraging these annotations, we design a system that employs large language models to predict conversational personality. Human evaluators were engaged to identify conversational characteristics and assign personality labels. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed system achieves stronger alignment with human judgments compared to existing approaches.

Title: A system identification approach to clustering vector autoregressive time series
Authors: Zuogong Yue, Xinyi Wang, Victor Solo
Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model. Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR (Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable. We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and also scales well computationally.

Title: S2SBench: A Benchmark for Quantifying Intelligence Degradation in Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models
Authors: Yuanbo Fang, Haoze Sun, Jun Liu, Tao Zhang, Zenan Zhou, Weipeng Chen, Xiaofen Xing, Xiangmin Xu
Abstract: End-to-end speech large language models ((LLMs)) extend the capabilities of text-based models to directly process and generate audio tokens. However, this often leads to a decline in reasoning and generation performance compared to text input, a phenomenon referred to as intelligence degradation. To systematically evaluate this gap, we propose S2SBench, a benchmark designed to quantify performance degradation in Speech LLMs. It includes diagnostic datasets targeting sentence continuation and commonsense reasoning under audio input. We further introduce a pairwise evaluation protocol based on perplexity differences between plausible and implausible samples to measure degradation relative to text input. We apply S2SBench to analyze the training process of Baichuan-Audio, which further demonstrates the benchmark's effectiveness. All datasets and evaluation code are available at this https URL.

Title: Complexity of frequency fluctuations and the interpretive style in the bass viola da gamba
Authors: Igor Lugo, Martha G. Alatriste-Contreras, Rafael Sánchez-Guevara
Abstract: Audio signals in a set of musical pieces are modeled as a complex network for studying the relationship between the complexity of frequency fluctuations and the interpretive style of the bass viola da gamba. Based on interdisciplinary scientific and music approaches, we compute the spectral decomposition and translated its frequency components to a network of sounds. We applied a best fit analysis for identifying the statistical distributions that describe more precisely the behavior of such frequencies and computed the centrality measures and identify cliques for characterizing such a network. Findings suggested statistical regularities in the type of statistical distribution that best describes frequency fluctuations. The centrality measure confirmed the most influential and stable group of sounds in a piece of music, meanwhile the identification of the largest clique indicated functional groups of sounds that interact closely for identifying the emergence of complex frequency fluctuations. Therefore, by modeling the sound as a complex network, we can clearly associate the presence of large-scale statistical regularities with the presence of similar frequency fluctuations related to different musical events played by a same musician.

Title: PAST: Phonetic-Acoustic Speech Tokenizer
Authors: Nadav Har-Tuv, Or Tal, Yossi Adi
Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see: this https URL

Title: Global Maxwell Tomography Using the Volume-Surface Integral Equation for Improved Estimation of Electrical Properties
Authors: Ilias Giannakopoulos, José E. Cruz Serrallés, Jan Paška, Martijn A. Cloos, Ryan Brown, Riccardo Lattanzi
Abstract: Objective: Global Maxwell Tomography (GMT) is a noninvasive inverse optimization method for the estimation of electrical properties (EP) from magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. GMT uses the volume integral equation (VIE) in the forward problem and assumes that the sample has negligible effect on the coil currents. Consequently, GMT calculates the coil's incident fields with an initial EP distribution and keeps them constant for all optimization iterations. This can lead to erroneous reconstructions. This work introduces a novel version of GMT that replaces VIE with the volume-surface integral equation (VSIE), which recalculates the coil currents at every iteration based on updated EP estimates before computing the associated fields. Methods: We simulated an 8-channel transceiver coil array for 7 T brain imaging and reconstructed the EP of a realistic head model using VSIE-based GMT. We built the coil, collected experimental MR measurements, and reconstructed EP of a two-compartment phantom. Results: In simulations, VSIE-based GMT outperformed VIE-based GMT by at least 12% for both EP. In experiments, the relative difference with respect to probe-measured EP values in the inner (outer) compartment was 13% (26%) and 17% (33%) for the permittivity and conductivity, respectively. Conclusion: The use of VSIE over VIE enhances GMT's performance by accounting for the effect of the EP on the coil currents. Significance: VSIE-based GMT does not rely on an initial EP estimate, rendering it more suitable for experimental reconstructions compared to the VIE-based GMT.

Title: Representation Learning for Semantic Alignment of Language, Audio, and Visual Modalities
Authors: Parthasaarathy Sudarsanam, Irene Martín-Morató, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: This paper proposes a single-stage training approach that semantically aligns three modalities - audio, visual, and text using a contrastive learning framework. Contrastive training has gained prominence for multimodal alignment, utilizing large-scale unlabeled data to learn shared representations. Existing deep learning approach for trimodal alignment involves two-stages, that separately align visual-text and audio-text modalities. This approach suffers from mismatched data distributions, resulting in suboptimal alignment. Leveraging the AVCaps dataset, which provides audio, visual and audio-visual captions for video clips, our method jointly optimizes the representation of all the modalities using contrastive training. Our results demonstrate that the single-stage approach outperforms the two-stage method, achieving a two-fold improvement in audio based visual retrieval, highlighting the advantages of unified multimodal representation learning.

Title: Towards a Foundation Model for Communication Systems
Authors: Davide Buffelli, Sowmen Das, Yu-Wei Lin, Sattar Vakili, Chien-Yi Wang, Masoud Attarifar, Pritthijit Nath, Da-shan Shiu
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated unprecedented performance across various domains, and its application to communication systems is an active area of research. While current methods focus on task-specific solutions, the broader trend in AI is shifting toward large general models capable of supporting multiple applications. In this work, we take a step toward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based, multi-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data. We propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization, positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder, Doppler spread, and delay profile.

Title: A General Framework for Group Sparsity in Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Endmember Bundles
Authors: Gokul Bhusal, Yifei Lou, Cristina Garcia-Cardona, Ekaterina Merkurjev
Abstract: Due to low spatial resolution, hyperspectral data often consists of mixtures of contributions from multiple materials. This limitation motivates the task of hyperspectral unmixing (HU), a fundamental problem in hyperspectral imaging. HU aims to identify the spectral signatures (\textit{endmembers}) of the materials present in an observed scene, along with their relative proportions (\textit{fractional abundance}) in each pixel. A major challenge lies in the class variability in materials, which hinders accurate representation by a single spectral signature, as assumed in the conventional linear mixing model. Moreover, To address this issue, we propose using group sparsity after representing each material with a set of spectral signatures, known as endmember bundles, where each group corresponds to a specific material. In particular, we develop a bundle-based framework that can enforce either inter-group sparsity or sparsity within and across groups (SWAG) on the abundance coefficients. Furthermore, our framework offers the flexibility to incorporate a variety of sparsity-promoting penalties, among which the transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) penalty is a novel regularization in the HU literature. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real hyperspectral data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches.

Title: Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search
Authors: Sina Sharifi, Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani, Mahyar Fazlyab
Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

Title: Vox-Profile: A Speech Foundation Model Benchmark for Characterizing Diverse Speaker and Speech Traits
Authors: Tiantian Feng, Jihwan Lee, Anfeng Xu, Yoonjeong Lee, Thanathai Lertpetchpun, Xuan Shi, Helin Wang, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Dani Byrd, Najim Dehak, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: We introduce Vox-Profile, a comprehensive benchmark to characterize rich speaker and speech traits using speech foundation models. Unlike existing works that focus on a single dimension of speaker traits, Vox-Profile provides holistic and multi-dimensional profiles that reflect both static speaker traits (e.g., age, sex, accent) and dynamic speech properties (e.g., emotion, speech flow). This benchmark is grounded in speech science and linguistics, developed with domain experts to accurately index speaker and speech characteristics. We report benchmark experiments using over 15 publicly available speech datasets and several widely used speech foundation models that target various static and dynamic speaker and speech properties. In addition to benchmark experiments, we showcase several downstream applications supported by Vox-Profile. First, we show that Vox-Profile can augment existing speech recognition datasets to analyze ASR performance variability. Vox-Profile is also used as a tool to evaluate the performance of speech generation systems. Finally, we assess the quality of our automated profiles through comparison with human evaluation and show convergent validity. Vox-Profile is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: Stabilizing Large-Scale Electric Power Grids with Adaptive Inertia
Authors: Julian Fritzsch, Philippe Jacquod
Abstract: The stability of AC power grids relies on ancillary services that mitigate frequency fluctuations. The electromechanical inertia of large synchronous generators is currently the only resource to absorb frequency disturbances on sub-second time scales. Replacing standard thermal power plants with inertialess new renewable sources of energy (NRE) therefore jeopardizes grid stability against e.g. sudden power generation losses. To guarantee system stability and compensate the lack of electromechanical inertia in grids with large penetrations of NREs, virtual synchronous generators, that emulate conventional generators, have been proposed. Here, we propose a novel control scheme for virtual synchronous generators, where the provided inertia is large at short times -- thereby absorbing faults as efficiently as conventional generators -- but decreases over a tunable time scale to prevent coherent frequency oscillations from setting in. We evaluate the performance of this adaptive inertia scheme under sudden power losses in large-scale transmission grids. We find that it systematically outperforms conventional, electromechanical inertia and that it is more stable than previously suggested schemes. Numerical simulations show how a quasi-optimal geographical distribution of adaptive inertia devices not only absorbs local faults efficiently, but also significantly increases the damping of inter-area oscillations. Our results show that the proposed adaptive inertia control scheme is an excellent solution to strengthen grid stability in future low-inertia power grids with large penetrations of NREs.

Title: Synchronous Observer Design for Inertial Navigation Systems with Almost-Global Convergence
Authors: Pieter van Goor, Tarek Hamel, Robert Mahony
Abstract: An Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a system that integrates acceleration and angular velocity readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), along with other sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) position, GNSS velocity, and magnetometer, to estimate the attitude, velocity, and position of a vehicle. This paper shows that the INS problem can be analysed using the automorphism group of the extended special Euclidean group: a group we term the extended similarity group . By exploiting this novel geometric framework, we propose a synchronous observer architecture; that is, an observer architecture for which the observer error is stationary if the correction terms are set to zero. In turn, this enables us to derive a modular, or plug-and-play, observer design for INS that allows different sensors to be added or removed depending on what is available in the vehicle sensor suite. We prove both almost-global asymptotic and local exponential stability of the error dynamics for the common scenario of at least IMU and GNSS position. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first non-linear observer design with almost global convergence guarantees or with plug-and-play modular capability. A simulation with extreme initial error demonstrates the almost-global robustness of the system. Real-world capability is demonstrated on data from a fixed-wing UAV, and the solution is compared to the state-of-the-art ArduPilot INS.

Title: StainDiffuser: MultiTask Dual Diffusion Model for Virtual Staining
Authors: Tushar Kataria, Beatrice Knudsen, Shireen Y. Elhabian
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is widely regarded as the standard in pathology for diagnosing diseases and tracking tumor recurrence. While H&E staining shows tissue structures, it lacks the ability to reveal specific proteins that are associated with disease severity and treatment response. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains use antibodies to highlight the expression of these proteins on their respective cell types, improving diagnostic accuracy, and assisting with drug selection for treatment. Despite their value, IHC stains require additional time and resources, limiting their utilization in some clinical settings. Recent advances in deep learning have positioned Image-to-Image (I2I) translation as a computational, cost-effective alternative for IHC. I2I generates high fidelity stain transformations digitally, potentially replacing manual staining in IHC. Diffusion models, the current state of the art in image generation and conditional tasks, are particularly well suited for virtual IHC due to their ability to produce high quality images and resilience to mode collapse. However, these models require extensive and diverse datasets (often millions of samples) to achieve a robust performance, a challenge in virtual staining applications where only thousands of samples are typically available. Inspired by the success of multitask deep learning models in scenarios with limited data, we introduce STAINDIFFUSER, a novel multitask diffusion architecture tailored to virtual staining that achieves convergence with smaller datasets. STAINDIFFUSER simultaneously trains two diffusion processes: (a) generating cell specific IHC stains from H&E images and (b) performing H&E based cell segmentation, utilizing coarse segmentation labels exclusively during training. STAINDIFFUSER generates high-quality virtual stains for two markers, outperforming over twenty I2I baselines.

Title: Hierarchical Decoupling Capacitor Optimization for Power Distribution Network of 2.5D ICs with Co-Analysis of Frequency and Time Domains Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yuanyuan Duan, Haiyang Feng, Zhiping Yu, Hanming Wu, Leilai Shao, Xiaolei Zhu
Abstract: With the growing need for higher memory bandwidth and computation density, 2.5D design, which involves integrating multiple chiplets onto an interposer, emerges as a promising solution. However, this integration introduces significant challenges due to increasing data rates and a large number of I/Os, necessitating advanced optimization of the power distribution networks (PDNs) both on-chip and on-interposer to mitigate the small signal noise and simultaneous switching noise (SSN). Traditional PDN optimization strategies in 2.5D systems primarily focus on reducing impedance by integrating decoupling capacitors (decaps) to lessen small signal noises. Unfortunately, relying solely on frequency-domain analysis has been proven inadequate for addressing coupled SSN, as indicated by our experimental results. In this work, we introduce a novel two-phase optimization flow using deep reinforcement learning to tackle both the on-chip small signal noise and SSN. Initially, we optimize the impedance in the frequency domain to maintain the small signal noise within acceptable limits while avoiding over-design. Subsequently, in the time domain, we refine the PDN to minimize the voltage violation integral (VVI), a more accurate measure of SSN severity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dual-domain optimization strategy that simultaneously addresses both the small signal noise and SSN propagation through strategic decap placement in on-chip and on-interposer PDNs, offering a significant step forward in the design of robust PDNs for 2.5D integrated systems.

Title: USEF-TSE: Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Bang Zeng, Ming Li
Abstract: Target speaker extraction aims to separate the voice of a specific speaker from mixed speech. Traditionally, this process has relied on extracting a speaker embedding from a reference speech, in which a speaker recognition model is required. However, identifying an appropriate speaker recognition model can be challenging, and using the target speaker embedding as reference information may not be optimal for target speaker extraction tasks. This paper introduces a Universal Speaker Embedding-Free Target Speaker Extraction (USEF-TSE) framework that operates without relying on speaker embeddings. USEF-TSE utilizes a multi-head cross-attention mechanism as a frame-level target speaker feature extractor. This innovative approach allows mainstream speaker extraction solutions to bypass the dependency on speaker recognition models and better leverage the information available in the enrollment speech, including speaker characteristics and contextual details. Additionally, USEF-TSE can seamlessly integrate with other time-domain or time-frequency domain speech separation models to achieve effective speaker extraction. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) on the WSJ0-2mix, WHAM!, and WHAMR! datasets, which are standard benchmarks for monaural anechoic, noisy and noisy-reverberant two-speaker speech separation and speaker extraction. The results on the LibriMix and the blind test set of the ICASSP 2023 DNS Challenge demonstrate that the model performs well on more diverse and out-of-domain data.

Title: TF-Mamba: A Time-Frequency Network for Sound Source Localization
Authors: Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) determines the position of sound sources using multi-channel audio data. It is commonly used to improve speech enhancement and separation. Extracting spatial features is crucial for SSL, especially in challenging acoustic environments. Recently, a novel structure referred to as Mamba demonstrated notable performance across various sequence-based modalities. This study introduces the Mamba for SSL tasks. We consider the Mamba-based model to analyze spatial features from speech signals by fusing both time and frequency features, and we develop an SSL system called TF-Mamba. This system integrates time and frequency fusion, with Bidirectional Mamba managing both time-wise and frequency-wise processing. We conduct the experiments on the simulated and real datasets. Experiments show that TF-Mamba significantly outperforms other advanced methods. The code will be publicly released in due course.

Title: Frozen Large Language Models Can Perceive Paralinguistic Aspects of Speech
Authors: Wonjune Kang, Junteng Jia, Chunyang Wu, Wei Zhou, Egor Lakomkin, Yashesh Gaur, Leda Sari, Suyoun Kim, Ke Li, Jay Mahadeokar, Ozlem Kalinli
Abstract: This work studies the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to understand paralinguistic aspects of speech without fine-tuning its weights. We utilize an end-to-end system with a speech encoder, which is trained to produce token embeddings such that the LLM's response to an expressive speech prompt is aligned with its response to a semantically matching text prompt that has also been conditioned on the user's speaking style. This framework enables the encoder to generate tokens that capture both linguistic and paralinguistic information and effectively convey them to the LLM, even when the LLM's weights remain completely frozen. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore how to induce a frozen LLM to understand more than just linguistic content from speech inputs in a general interaction setting. Experiments demonstrate that our system is able to produce higher quality and more empathetic responses to expressive speech prompts compared to several baselines.

Title: F5-TTS: A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching
Authors: Yushen Chen, Zhikang Niu, Ziyang Ma, Keqi Deng, Chunhui Wang, Jian Zhao, Kai Yu, Xie Chen
Abstract: This paper introduces F5-TTS, a fully non-autoregressive text-to-speech system based on flow matching with Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS. However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness. To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech. We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model's performance and efficiency. This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining. Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15, which is greatly improved compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based TTS models. Trained on a public 100K hours multilingual dataset, our F5-TTS exhibits highly natural and expressive zero-shot ability, seamless code-switching capability, and speed control efficiency. We have released all codes and checkpoints to promote community development, at this https URL.

Title: Beyond inherent robustness: strong stability of MPC despite plant-model mismatch
Authors: Steven J. Kuntz, James B. Rawlings
Abstract: In this technical report, we establish the asymptotic stability of MPC under plant-model mismatch for problems where the origin remains a steady state despite mismatch. This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.

Title: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge: Detecting Suicide Risk Among Adolescents
Authors: Wen Wu, Ziyun Cui, Chang Lei, Yinan Duan, Diyang Qu, Ji Wu, Bowen Zhou, Runsen Chen, Chao Zhang
Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge (SW1) aims to advance methods for detecting current suicide risk in adolescents using speech analysis techniques. Suicide among adolescents is a critical public health issue globally. Early detection of suicidal tendencies can lead to timely intervention and potentially save lives. Traditional methods of assessment often rely on self-reporting or clinical interviews, which may not always be accessible. The SW1 challenge addresses this gap by exploring speech as a non-invasive and readily available indicator of mental health. We release the SW1 dataset which contains speech recordings from 600 adolescents aged 10-18 years. By focusing on speech generated from natural tasks, the challenge seeks to uncover patterns and markers that correlate with current suicide risk.

Title: Distributed Model Predictive Control Design for Multi-agent Systems via Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Hossein Nejatbakhsh Esfahani, Kai Liu, Javad Mohammadpour Velni
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach that leverages Multi-agent Bayesian Optimization (MABO) to design Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) schemes for multi-agent systems. The primary objective is to learn optimal DMPC schemes even when local model predictive controllers rely on imperfect local models. The proposed method invokes a dual decomposition-based distributed optimization framework, incorporating an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based MABO algorithm to enable coordinated learning of parameterized DMPC schemes. This enhances the closed-loop performance of local controllers, despite discrepancies between their models and the actual multi-agent system dynamics. In addition to the newly proposed algorithms, this work also provides rigorous proofs establishing the optimality and convergence of the underlying learning method. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MABO-based learning approach.

Title: STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting
Authors: Bonan An, Weidong Mei, Yuanwei Liu, Dong Wang, Zhi Chen
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.

Title: Signal Whisperers: Enhancing Wireless Reception Using DRL-Guided Reflector Arrays
Authors: Hieu Le, Oguz Bedir, Mostafa Ibrahim, Jian Tao, Sabit Ekin
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing wireless signal reception through self-adjustable metallic surfaces, termed reflectors, which are guided by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The designed reflector system aims to improve signal quality for multiple users in scenarios where a direct line-of-sight (LOS) from the access point (AP) and reflector to users is not guaranteed. Utilizing DRL techniques, the reflector autonomously modifies its configuration to optimize beam allocation from the AP to user equipment (UE), thereby maximizing path gain. Simulation results indicate substantial improvements in the average path gain for all UEs compared to baseline configurations, highlighting the potential of DRL-driven reflectors in creating adaptive communication environments.

Title: Self-Supervised Frameworks for Speaker Verification via Bootstrapped Positive Sampling
Authors: Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak
Abstract: Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Standard SSL frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs extracted from the same audio utterances. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, under the assumption that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method demonstrates consistent improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when implemented in major SSL frameworks, such as SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR, and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.

Title: Process Resilience under Optimal Data Injection Attacks
Authors: Xiuzhen Ye, Wentao Tang
Abstract: In this paper, we study the resilience of process systems in an {\it information-theoretic framework}, from the perspective of an attacker capable of optimally constructing data injection attacks. The attack aims to distract the stationary distributions of process variables and stay stealthy, simultaneously. The problem is formulated as designing a multivariate Gaussian distribution to maximize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the stationary distributions of states and state estimates under attacks and without attacks, while minimizing that between the distributions of sensor measurements. When the attacker has limited access to sensors, sparse attacks are proposed by incorporating a sparsity constraint. {We conduct theoretical analysis on the convexity of the attack construction problem and present a greedy algorithm, which enables systematic assessment of measurement vulnerability, thereby offering insights into the inherent resilience of process systems. We numerically evaluate the performance of proposed constructions on a two-reactor process.

Title: Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation
Authors: Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You
Abstract: The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.

Abstract: This work focuses on the synergy of physical layer covert transmission and millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to improve the performance, and enable secure internet of things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we employ a physical layer covert transmission as a prism, which can achieve simultaneously transmitting confidential signals to a covert communication user equipment (UE) in the presence of a warden and regular communication UEs. We design the transmit beamforming to guarantee information transmission security, communication quality-of-service (QoS) and sensing accuracy. By considering two different beamforming architectures, i.e., fully digital beamforming (FDBF) and hybrid beamforming (HBF), an optimal design method and a low-cost beamforming scheme are proposed to address the corresponding problems, respectively. Furthermore, building on the previously derived algorithm, two robust variants are proposed to address the more challenging case where the warden's CSI is imperfect. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FDBF/HBF algorithms compared with traditional algorithms in terms of information transmission security, communication QoS and target detection performance.

Title: RACNN: Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Near-Field Channel Estimation in 6G Wireless Communications
Authors: Vu Tung Lam, Do Hai Son, Tran Thi Thuy Quynh, Le Trung Thanh
Abstract: Near-field channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, where extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) enable near-field communication (NFC) but introduce significant signal processing complexity. Traditional model-based methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability in large-scale ELAA systems, while existing learning-based approaches often lack robustness across diverse channel conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN), which integrates convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction by focusing on key regions within the CNN feature maps. Experimental results show that RACNN outperforms both traditional and learning-based methods, including XLCNet, across various scenarios, particularly in mixed far-field and near-field conditions. Notably, in these challenging settings, RACNN achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 4.8*10^(-3) at an SNR of 20dB, making it a promising solution for near-field channel estimation in 6G.

Title: Low-Complexity Near-Field Beam Training with DFT Codebook based on Beam Pattern Analysis
Authors: Zijun Wang, Rama Kiran, Shawn Tsai, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) operating in high-frequency bands have spurred the development of near-field communication, driving advancements in beam training design. This paper introduces an efficient near-field beam training method that utilizes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook traditionally employed for far-field users (FUs). We begin by analyzing the received beam pattern and deriving closed-form expressions for its width and central beam gain as a function of user location. Building on these derived expressions, we propose a beam training method that estimates user distance from the received signal powers using DFT beams, with a computational complexity of O(1). Simulation results confirm the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its ability to perform low-complexity near-field beam training with high estimation accuracy. Notably, our proposed scheme achieves up to a 1.96 dB SNR gain over exhaustive search methods in multi-user beamforming scenarios.

Title: Explaining Uncertainty in Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Beyond Prediction Errors
Authors: Nataliia Molchanova, Pedro M. Gordaliza, Alessandro Cagol, Mario Ocampo--Pineda, Po--Jui Lu, Matthias Weigel, Xinjie Chen, Erin S. Beck, Haris Tsagkas, Daniel Reich, Anna Stölting, Pietro Maggi, Delphine Ribes, Adrien Depeursinge, Cristina Granziera, Henning Müller, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) is essential in healthcare, particularly for high-stakes tasks like medical image segmentation. Explainable AI and uncertainty quantification significantly enhance AI reliability by addressing key attributes such as robustness, usability, and explainability. Despite extensive technical advances in uncertainty quantification for medical imaging, understanding the clinical informativeness and interpretability of uncertainty remains limited. This study introduces a novel framework to explain the potential sources of predictive uncertainty, specifically in cortical lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis using deep ensembles. The proposed analysis shifts the focus from the uncertainty-error relationship towards relevant medical and engineering factors. Our findings reveal that instance-wise uncertainty is strongly related to lesion size, shape, and cortical involvement. Expert rater feedback confirms that similar factors impede annotator confidence. Evaluations conducted on two datasets (206 patients, almost 2000 lesions) under both in-domain and distribution-shift conditions highlight the utility of the framework in different scenarios.

Title: A portable diagnosis model for Keratoconus using a smartphone
Authors: Yifan Li, Peter Ho, Jo Woon Chong
Abstract: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal disorder that results in blurry and distorted vision. Traditional diagnostic tools, while effective, are often bulky, costly, and require professional operation. In this paper, we present a portable and innovative methodology for diagnosing. Our proposed approach first captures the image reflected on the eye's cornea when a smartphone screen-generated Placido disc sheds its light on an eye, then utilizes a two-stage diagnosis for identifying the KC cornea and pinpointing the location of the KC on the cornea. The first stage estimates the height and width of the Placido disc extracted from the captured image to identify whether it has KC. In this KC identification, k-means clustering is implemented to discern statistical characteristics, such as height and width values of extracted Placido discs, from non-KC (control) and KC-affected groups. The second stage involves the creation of a distance matrix, providing a precise localization of KC on the cornea, which is critical for efficient treatment planning. The analysis of these distance matrices, paired with a logistic regression model and robust statistical analysis, reveals a clear distinction between control and KC groups. The logistic regression model, which classifies small areas on the cornea as either control or KC-affected based on the corresponding inter-disc distances in the distance matrix, reported a classification accuracy of 96.94%, which indicates that we can effectively pinpoint the protrusion caused by KC. This comprehensive, smartphone-based method is expected to detect KC and streamline timely treatment.

Title: Dynamic Beam-Stabilized, Additive-Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays with On-Chip Rapid Insight Generation
Authors: Sreeni Poolakkal, Abdullah Islam, Arpit Rao, Shrestha Bansal, Ted Dabrowski, Kalsi Kwan, Zhongxuan Wang, Amit Kumar Mishra, Julio Navarro, Shenqiang Ren, John Williams, Sudip Shekhar, Subhanshu Gupta
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with < 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.

Title: Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems
Authors: Jeffrey Alido, Tongyu Li, Yu Sun, Lei Tian
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

Title: HWA-UNETR: Hierarchical Window Aggregate UNETR for 3D Multimodal Gastric Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Jiaming Liang, Lihuan Dai, Xiaoqi Sheng, Xiangguang Chen, Chun Yao, Guihua Tao, Qibin Leng, Hongmin Cai, Xi Zhong
Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via this https URL.

Title: Bayesian Deep Learning Approaches for Uncertainty-Aware Retinal OCT Image Segmentation for Multiple Sclerosis
Authors: Samuel T. M. Ball
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides valuable insights in ophthalmology, cardiology, and neurology due to high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina. One critical task for ophthalmologists using OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is time-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability of diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face challenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of uncertainty estimation, leading to "confidently wrong" models via hallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT imaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian models can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can further be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording artefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also allows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as layer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these features come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over all delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%. Our work brings greater clinical applicability, statistical robustness, and performance to retinal OCT segmentation.

Title: Universal Semantic Disentangled Privacy-preserving Speech Representation Learning

Abstract: The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: (i) privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and (ii) residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations.

Title: Stochastic Learning of Computational Resource Usage as Graph Structured Multimarginal Schrödinger Bridge
Authors: Georgiy A. Bondar, Robert Gifford, Linh Thi Xuan Phan, Abhishek Halder
Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schrödinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.

Title: Diffusion-Based Failure Sampling for Evaluating Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems
Authors: Harrison Delecki, Marc R. Schlichting, Mansur Arief, Anthony Corso, Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Abstract: Validating safety-critical autonomous systems in high-dimensional domains such as robotics presents a significant challenge. Existing black-box approaches based on Markov chain Monte Carlo may require an enormous number of samples, while methods based on importance sampling often rely on simple parametric families that may struggle to represent the distribution over failures. We propose to sample the distribution over failures using a conditional denoising diffusion model, which has shown success in complex high-dimensional problems such as robotic task planning. We iteratively train a diffusion model to produce state trajectories closer to failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on high-dimensional robotic validation tasks, improving sample efficiency and mode coverage compared to existing black-box techniques.

Title: aTENNuate: Optimized Real-time Speech Enhancement with Deep SSMs on Raw Audio
Authors: Yan Ru Pei, Ritik Shrivastava, FNU Sidharth
Abstract: We present aTENNuate, a simple deep state-space autoencoder configured for efficient online raw speech enhancement in an end-to-end fashion. The network's performance is primarily evaluated on raw speech denoising, with additional assessments on tasks such as super-resolution and de-quantization. We benchmark aTENNuate on the VoiceBank + DEMAND and the Microsoft DNS1 synthetic test sets. The network outperforms previous real-time denoising models in terms of PESQ score, parameter count, MACs, and latency. Even as a raw waveform processing model, the model maintains high fidelity to the clean signal with minimal audible artifacts. In addition, the model remains performant even when the noisy input is compressed down to 4000Hz and 4 bits, suggesting general speech enhancement capabilities in low-resource environments.

Title: Unified Microphone Conversion: Many-to-Many Device Mapping via Feature-wise Linear Modulation
Authors: Myeonghoon Ryu, Hongseok Oh, Suji Lee, Han Park
Abstract: We present Unified Microphone Conversion, a unified generative framework designed to bolster sound event classification (SEC) systems against device variability. While our prior CycleGAN-based methods effectively simulate device characteristics, they require separate models for each device pair, limiting scalability. Our approach overcomes this constraint by conditioning the generator on frequency response data, enabling many-to-many device mappings through unpaired training. We integrate frequency-response information via Feature-wise Linear Modulation, further enhancing scalability. Additionally, incorporating synthetic frequency response differences improves the applicability of our framework for real-world application. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.6% and reduces variability by 0.8% in macro-average F1 score.

Title: Electrocardiogram-based diagnosis of liver diseases: an externally validated and explainable machine learning approach
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Background: Liver diseases present a significant global health challenge and often require costly, invasive diagnostics. Electrocardiography (ECG), a widely available and non-invasive tool, can enable the detection of liver disease by capturing cardiovascular-hepatic interactions. Methods: We trained tree-based machine learning models on ECG features to detect liver diseases using two large datasets: MIMIC-IV-ECG (467,729 patients, 2008-2019) and ECG-View II (775,535 patients, 1994-2013). The task was framed as binary classification, with performance evaluated via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To improve interpretability, we applied explainability methods to identify key predictive features. Findings: The models showed strong predictive performance with good generalizability. For example, AUROCs for alcoholic liver disease (K70) were 0.8025 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8020-0.8035) internally and 0.7644 (95% CI, 0.7641-0.7649) externally; for hepatic failure (K72), scores were 0.7404 (95% CI, 0.7389-0.7415) and 0.7498 (95% CI, 0.7494-0.7509), respectively. The explainability analysis consistently identified age and prolonged QTc intervals (corrected QT, reflecting ventricular repolarization) as key predictors. Features linked to autonomic regulation and electrical conduction abnormalities were also prominent, supporting known cardiovascular-liver connections and suggesting QTc as a potential biomarker. Interpretation: ECG-based machine learning offers a promising, interpretable approach for liver disease detection, particularly in resource-limited settings. By revealing clinically relevant biomarkers, this method supports non-invasive diagnostics, early detection, and risk stratification prior to targeted clinical assessments.

Title: Local Identifiability of Fully-Connected Feed-Forward Networks with Nonlinear Node Dynamics
Authors: Martina Vanelli, Julien M. Hendrickx
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.

Title: ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network With Explicitly-Optimized Rational Graph Filters
Authors: Guoming Li, Jian Yang, Shangsong Liang
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.

Title: xLSTM-SENet: xLSTM for Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jan Østergaard, Jesper Jensen, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: While attention-based architectures, such as Conformers, excel in speech enhancement, they face challenges such as scalability with respect to input sequence length. In contrast, the recently proposed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture offers linear scalability. However, xLSTM-based models remain unexplored for speech enhancement. This paper introduces xLSTM-SENet, the first xLSTM-based single-channel speech enhancement system. A comparative analysis reveals that xLSTM-and notably, even LSTM-can match or outperform state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems across various model sizes in speech enhancement on the VoiceBank+Demand dataset. Through ablation studies, we identify key architectural design choices such as exponential gating and bidirectionality contributing to its effectiveness. Our best xLSTM-based model, xLSTM-SENet2, outperforms state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset.

Title: The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective
Authors: Michael Muehlebach, Zhiyu He, Michael I. Jordan
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in the general setting of nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, their ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.

Title: DeepForest: Sensing Into Self-Occluding Volumes of Vegetation With Aerial Imaging
Authors: Mohamed Youssef, Jian Peng, Oliver Bimber
Abstract: Access to below-canopy volumetric vegetation data is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We address the long-standing limitation of remote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are currently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation structures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top layers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce outof-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks with mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume. Compared with simulated ground truth, our correction leads to ~x7 average improvements (min: ~x2, max: ~x12) for forest densities of 200 trees/ha - 1680 trees/ha. In our field experiment, we achieved an MSE of 0.05 when comparing with the top-vegetation layer that was measured with classical multispectral aerial imaging.

Title: DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning
Authors: Zhuoyuan Mao, Mengjie Zhao, Qiyu Wu, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-LLM fusion Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring DeepResonance for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We plan to open-source the models and the newly constructed datasets.

Title: Polynomial and Parallelizable Preconditioning for Block Tridiagonal Positive Definite Matrices
Authors: Shaohui Yang, Toshiyuki Ohtsuka, Brian Plancher, Colin N. Jones
Abstract: The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore's law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework. We first construct and prove the optimal parametrization theoretically in terms of the least amount of distinct eigenvalues and the narrowest spectrum range. We then compare the theoretical time complexity of solving the linear system directly or iteratively. We finally show through numerical experiments how much the preconditioning improves the convergence of OCP linear systems solves.

Title: A Unified Theoretic and Algorithmic Framework for Solving Multivariate Linear Model with $\ell^1$-norm Approximation
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Feng, Hong-Yan Zhanga, Ji Ma, Daniel Delahaye, Ruo-Shi Yang, Man Liang
Abstract: It is a challenging problem that solving the \textit{multivariate linear model} (MLM) $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with the $\ell_1 $-norm approximation method such that $||\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||_1$, the $\ell_1$-norm of the \textit{residual error vector} (REV), is minimized. In this work, our contributions lie in two aspects: firstly, the equivalence theorem for the structure of the $\ell_1$-norm optimal solution to the MLM is proposed and proved; secondly, a unified algorithmic framework for solving the MLM with $\ell_1$-norm optimization is proposed and six novel algorithms (L1-GPRS, L1-TNIPM, L1-HP, L1-IST, L1-ADM, L1-POB) are designed. There are three significant characteristics in the algorithms discussed: they are implemented with simple matrix operations which do not depend on specific optimization solvers; they are described with algorithmic pseudo-codes and implemented with Python and Octave/MATLAB which means easy usage; and the high accuracy and efficiency of our six new algorithms can be achieved successfully in the scenarios with different levels of data redundancy. We hope that the unified theoretic and algorithmic framework with source code released on GitHub could motivate the applications of the $\ell_1$-norm optimization for parameter estimation of MLM arising in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, economics, and so on.

Title: ViMo: A Generative Visual GUI World Model for App Agents
Authors: Dezhao Luo, Bohan Tang, Kang Li, Georgios Papoudakis, Jifei Song, Shaogang Gong, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Kun Shao
Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.

Title: How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?
Authors: Wenhui Zhu, Peijie Qiu, Xiwen Chen, Zhangsihao Yang, Aristeidis Sotiras, Abolfazl Razi, Yalin Wang
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming
Authors: Ju-Hyung Lee, Yanqing Lu, Klaus Doppler
Abstract: Roaming in Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

Title: Prompting Large Language Models for Training-Free Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring
Authors: Junyu Xue, Xudong Wang, Xiaoling He, Shicheng Liu, Yi Wang, Guoming Tang
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household electricity consumption into individual appliance usage and thus enables more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples on widely used open datasets. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance explainability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Authors: Zachary Novack, Zach Evans, Zack Zukowski, Josiah Taylor, CJ Carr, Julian Parker, Adnan Al-Sinan, Gian Marco Iodice, Julian McAuley, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Jordi Pons
Abstract: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in $\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.

Title: MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter
Authors: Jiazhu Li, Jian Kuang, Xiaoji Niu
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.
