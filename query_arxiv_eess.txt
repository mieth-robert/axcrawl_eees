Title: Semantic-Aware Edge Intelligence for UAV Handover in 6G Networks
Authors: Aubida A. Al-Hameed, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Maryam Hafeez, Syed A. Zaidi
Abstract: 6G wireless networks aim to exploit semantic awareness to optimize radio resources. By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal, the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency can be improved. To that end, this paper investigates a paradigm in which the capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) on the edge are harnessed for network optimization. In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate set of contextual "Reason Tags" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios, demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of approximately 0.9 for reason tags.

Title: A Hybrid Optimal Velocity Drag Model for Traffic Flow Dynamics
Authors: Nizhum Rahman, Trachette L. Jackson
Abstract: We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.

Title: VIRTUS-FPP: Virtual Sensor Modeling for Fringe Projection Profilometry in NVIDIA Isaac Sim
Authors: Adam Haroon, Anush Lakshman, Badrinath Balasubramaniam, Beiwen Li
Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been established as a high-accuracy 3D reconstruction method capable of achieving sub-pixel accuracy. However, this technique faces significant constraints due to complex calibration requirements, bulky system footprint, and sensitivity to environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we present VIRTUS-FPP, the first comprehensive physics-based virtual sensor modeling framework for FPP built in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. By leveraging the physics-based rendering and programmable sensing capabilities of simulation, our framework enables end-to-end modeling from calibration to reconstruction with full mathematical fidelity to the underlying principles of structured light. We conduct comprehensive virtual calibration and validate our system's reconstruction accuracy through quantitative comparison against ground truth geometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to model the virtual system as a digital twin by replicating a physical FPP system in simulation and validating correspondence between virtual and real-world measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that VIRTUS-FPP accurately models optical phenomena critical to FPP and achieves results comparable to real-world systems while offering unprecedented flexibility for system configuration, sensor prototyping, and environmental control. This framework significantly accelerates the development of real-world FPP systems by enabling rapid virtual prototyping before physical implementation.

Title: Explainable Deep Learning for Cataract Detection in Retinal Images: A Dual-Eye and Knowledge Distillation Approach
Authors: MohammadReza Abbaszadeh Bavil Soflaei, Karim SamadZamini
Abstract: Cataract remains a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, and early detection from retinal imaging is critical for timely intervention. We present a deep learning pipeline for cataract classification using the Ocular Disease Recognition dataset, containing left and right fundus photographs from 5000 patients. We evaluated CNNs, transformers, lightweight architectures, and knowledge-distilled models. The top-performing model, Swin-Base Transformer, achieved 98.58% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9836. A distilled MobileNetV3, trained with Swin-Base knowledge, reached 98.42% accuracy and a 0.9787 F1-score with greatly reduced computational cost. The proposed dual-eye Siamese variant of the distilled MobileNet, integrating information from both eyes, achieved an accuracy of 98.21%. Explainability analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrated that the CNNs concentrated on medically significant features, such as lens opacity and central blur. These results show that accurate, interpretable cataract detection is achievable even with lightweight models, supporting potential clinical integration in resource-limited settings

Title: Achieving Fair Skin Lesion Detection through Skin Tone Normalization and Channel Pruning
Authors: Zihan Wei, Tapabrata Chakraborti
Abstract: Recent works have shown that deep learning based skin lesion image classification models trained on unbalanced dataset can exhibit bias toward protected demographic attributes such as race, age,and gender. Current bias mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework, two nested optimization loops are used to find critical this http URL inner optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually training is done off line. More importantly,

Title: PerformSinger: Multimodal Singing Voice Synthesis Leveraging Synchronized Lip Cues from Singing Performance Videos
Authors: Ke Gu, Zhicong Wu, Peng Bai, Sitong Qiao, Zhiqi Jiang, Junchen Lu, Xiaodong Shi, Xinyuan Qian
Abstract: Existing singing voice synthesis (SVS) models largely rely on fine-grained, phoneme-level durations, which limits their practical application. These methods overlook the complementary role of visual information in duration this http URL address these issues, we propose PerformSinger, a pioneering multimodal SVS framework, which incorporates lip cues from video as a visual modality, enabling high-quality "duration-free" singing voice synthesis. PerformSinger comprises parallel multi-branch multimodal encoders, a feature fusion module, a duration and variational prediction network, a mel-spectrogram decoder and a vocoder. The fusion module, composed of adapter and fusion blocks, employs a progressive fusion strategy within an aligned semantic space to produce high-quality multimodal feature representations, thereby enabling accurate duration prediction and high-fidelity audio synthesis. To facilitate the research, we design, collect and annotate a novel SVS dataset involving synchronized video streams and precise phoneme-level manual annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposal in both subjective and objective evaluations. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Title: Rebuild AC Power Flow Models with Graph Attention Networks
Authors: Yuting Hu, Jinjun Xiong
Abstract: A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.

Title: Consistency Models as Plug-and-Play Priors for Inverse Problems
Authors: Merve Gülle, Junno Yun, Yaşar Utku Alçalar, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Title: Learning What To Hear: Boosting Sound-Source Association For Robust Audiovisual Instance Segmentation
Authors: Jinbae Seo, Hyeongjun Kwon, Kwonyoung Kim, Jiyoung Lee, Kwanghoon Sohn
Abstract: Audiovisual instance segmentation (AVIS) requires accurately localizing and tracking sounding objects throughout video sequences. Existing methods suffer from visual bias stemming from two fundamental issues: uniform additive fusion prevents queries from specializing to different sound sources, while visual-only training objectives allow queries to converge to arbitrary salient objects. We propose Audio-Centric Query Generation using cross-attention, enabling each query to selectively attend to distinct sound sources and carry sound-specific priors into visual decoding. Additionally, we introduce Sound-Aware Ordinal Counting (SAOC) loss that explicitly supervises sounding object numbers through ordinal regression with monotonic consistency constraints, preventing visual-only convergence during training. Experiments on AVISeg benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements: +1.64 mAP, +0.6 HOTA, and +2.06 FSLA, validating that query specialization and explicit counting supervision are crucial for accurate audiovisual instance segmentation.

Title: Finite Sample Analyses for Continuous-time Linear Systems: System Identification and Online Control
Authors: Hongyi Zhou, Jingwei Li, Jingzhao Zhang
Abstract: Real world evolves in continuous time but computations are done from finite samples. Therefore, we study algorithms using finite observations in continuous-time linear dynamical systems. We first study the system identification problem, and propose a first non-asymptotic error analysis with finite observations. Our algorithm identifies system parameters without needing integrated observations over certain time intervals, making it more practical for real-world applications. Further we propose a lower bound result that shows our estimator is provably optimal up to constant factors. Moreover, we apply the above algorithm to online control regret analysis for continuous-time linear system. Our system identification method allows us to explore more efficiently, enabling the swift detection of ineffective policies. We achieve a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ over a single $T$-time horizon in a controllable system, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(T)$ observations of the system.

Title: Index-MSR: A high-efficiency multimodal fusion framework for speech recognition
Authors: Jinming Chen, Lu Wang, Zheshu Song, Wei Deng
Abstract: Driven by large scale datasets and LLM based architectures, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable improvements in accuracy. However, challenges persist for domain-specific terminology, and short utterances lacking semantic coherence, where recognition performance often degrades significantly. In this work, we present Index-MSR, an efficient multimodal speech recognition framework. At its core is a novel Multimodal Fusion Decoder (MFD), which effectively incorporates text-related information from videos (e.g., subtitles and presentation slides) into the speech recognition. This cross-modal integration not only enhances overall ASR accuracy but also yields substantial reductions in substitution errors. Extensive evaluations on both an in-house subtitle dataset and a public AVSR dataset demonstrate that Index-MSR achieves sota accuracy, with substitution errors reduced by 20,50%. These results demonstrate that our approach efficiently exploits text-related cues from video to improve speech recognition accuracy, showing strong potential in applications requiring strict audio text synchronization, such as audio translation.

Title: Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data
Authors: Yi Hu, Zheyuan Cheng
Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

Title: Introducing Multimodal Paradigm for Learning Sleep Staging PSG via General-Purpose Model
Authors: Jianheng Zhou, Chenyu Liu, Jinan Zhou, Yi Ding, Yang Liu, Haoran Luo, Ziyu Jia, Xinliang Zhou
Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets (ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG image dataset will be released.

Title: Scalable Wi-Fi RSS-Based Indoor Localization via Automatic Vision-Assisted Calibration
Authors: Abdulkadir Bilge, Erdem Ergen, Burak Soner, Sinem Coleri
Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting (x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization, validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code, tools, and datasets are released as open source.

Title: Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation
Authors: Ashwini Kulkarni, Santosh Nannuru
Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation, which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.

Title: Stochastic Security Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow Using General Polynomial Chaos Expansion
Authors: Ghulam Mohy-ud-din, Yunqi Wang, Rahmat Heidari, Frederik Geth
Abstract: Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.

Title: Unsupervised Speech Enhancement using Data-defined Priors
Authors: Dominik Klement, Matthew Maciejewski, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Jan Černocký, Lukáš Burget
Abstract: The majority of deep learning-based speech enhancement methods require paired clean-noisy speech data. Collecting such data at scale in real-world conditions is infeasible, which has led the community to rely on synthetically generated noisy speech. However, this introduces a gap between the training and testing phases. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture for unsupervised speech enhancement that separates the input into clean speech and residual noise. Adversarial training is employed to impose priors on each branch, defined by unpaired datasets of clean speech and, optionally, noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to leading unsupervised speech enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical impact of clean speech data selection on enhancement performance. In particular, our findings reveal that performance may appear overly optimistic when in-domain clean speech data are used for prior definition -- a practice adopted in previous unsupervised speech enhancement studies.

Title: Resource Allocation in Cooperative Mid-band/THz Networks in the Presence of Mobility
Authors: Mohammad Amin Saeidi, Hina Tabassum
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs) in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered system.

Title: BFA: Real-time Multilingual Text-to-speech Forced Alignment
Authors: Abdul Rehman, Jingyao Cai, Jian-Jun Zhang, Xiaosong Yang
Abstract: We present Bournemouth Forced Aligner (BFA), a system that combines a Contextless Universal Phoneme Encoder (CUPE) with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC)based decoder. BFA introduces explicit modelling of inter-phoneme gaps and silences and hierarchical decoding strategies, enabling fine-grained boundary prediction. Evaluations on TIMIT and Buckeye corpora show that BFA achieves competitive recall relative to Montreal Forced Aligner at relaxed tolerance levels, while predicting both onset and offset boundaries for richer temporal structure. BFA processes speech up to 240x faster than MFA, enabling faster than real-time alignment. This combination of speed and silence-aware alignment opens opportunities for interactive speech applications previously constrained by slow aligners.

Title: Untangling Vascular Trees for Surgery and Interventional Radiology
Authors: Guillaume Houry, Tom Boeken, Stéphanie Allassonnière, Jean Feydy
Abstract: The diffusion of minimally invasive, endovascular interventions motivates the development of visualization methods for complex vascular networks. We propose a planar representation of blood vessel trees which preserves the properties that are most relevant to catheter navigation: topology, length and curvature. Taking as input a three-dimensional digital angiography, our algorithm produces a faithful two-dimensional map of the patient's vessels within a few seconds. To this end, we propose optimized implementations of standard morphological filters and a new recursive embedding algorithm that preserves the global orientation of the vascular network. We showcase our method on peroperative images of the brain, pelvic and knee artery networks. On the clinical side, our method simplifies the choice of devices prior to and during the intervention. This lowers the risk of failure during navigation or device deployment and may help to reduce the gap between expert and common intervention centers. From a research perspective, our method simulates the cadaveric display of artery trees from anatomical dissections. This opens the door to large population studies on the branching patterns and tortuosity of fine human blood vessels. Our code is released under the permissive MIT license as part of the scikit-shapes Python library (this https URL ).

Title: Enhanced Quality Aware-Scalable Underwater Image Compression
Authors: Linwei Zhu, Junhao Zhu, Xu Zhang, Huan Zhang, Ye Li, Runmin Cong, Sam Kwong
Abstract: Underwater imaging plays a pivotal role in marine exploration and ecological monitoring. However, it faces significant challenges of limited transmission bandwidth and severe distortion in the aquatic environment. In this work, to achieve the target of both underwater image compression and enhancement simultaneously, an enhanced quality-aware scalable underwater image compression framework is presented, which comprises a Base Layer (BL) and an Enhancement Layer (EL). In the BL, the underwater image is represented by controllable number of non-zero sparse coefficients for coding bits saving. Furthermore, the underwater image enhancement dictionary is derived with shared sparse coefficients to make reconstruction close to the enhanced version. In the EL, a dual-branch filter comprising rough filtering and detail refinement branches is designed to produce a pseudo-enhanced version for residual redundancy removal and to improve the quality of final reconstruction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works under five large-scale underwater image datasets in terms of Underwater Image Quality Measure (UIQM).

Title: Incorporating flexibility and resilience demand into capacity market considering the guidance on generation investment
Authors: Yunpeng Xiao, Hui Guo, Wenqi Wu, Xiuli Wang, Xifan Wang
Abstract: The capacity market provides economic guidance for generation investment and ensures the adequacy of generation capability for power systems. With the rapidly increasing proportion of renewable energy, the adequacy of flexibility and resilience becomes more crucial for the secure operation of power systems. In this context, this paper incorporates the flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market by formulating the capacity demand curves for ramping capability, inertia and recovery capabilities besides the generation capability. The guidance on generation investment of the capacity market is also taken into account by solving the generation investment equilibrium among generation companies with a Nash Cournot model employing an equivalent quadratic programming formulation. The overall problem is established as a trilevel game and an iterative algorithm is devised to formulate the capacity demand curves in the upper level based on Genco's investment acquired from the middle and lower levels. The case study further demonstrates that to incorporate flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market could stimulate proper generation investment and ensure the adequacy of flexibility and resilience in power systems.

Title: Dual-Function Beam Pattern Design for Multi-Target ISAC Systems: A Decoupled Approach
Authors: Wilson de Souza Junior, Taufik Abrao, Amine Mezghani, Ekram Hossain
Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU) multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS) performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost.

Title: On the Impact of LiDAR Point Cloud Compression on Remote Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Tiago de S. Fernandes, Ricardo L. de Queiroz
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR sensors to generate 3D point clouds for accurate segmentation and object detection. In a context of a smart city framework, we would like to understand the effect that transmission (compression) can have on remote (cloud) segmentation, instead of local processing. In this short paper, we try to understand the impact of point cloud compression on semantic segmentation performance and to estimate the necessary bandwidth requirements. We developed a new (suitable) distortion metric to evaluate such an impact. Two of MPEG's compression algorithms (GPCC and L3C2) and two leading semantic segmentation algorithms (2DPASS and PVKD) were tested over the Semantic KITTI dataset. Results indicate that high segmentation quality requires communication throughput of approximately 0.6 MB/s for G-PCC and 2.8 MB/s for L3C2. These results are important in order to plan infrastructure resources for autonomous navigation.

Title: Sensitivity Analysis for Antenna Devices through Interval Arithmetic -- A Generalized Approach
Authors: Nicola Anselmi, Paolo Rocca, Andrea Massa
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for the sensitivity analysis of electromagnetic (EM) systems whose transfer function (TF), that is the input-output (I/O) relationship between the input parameters affected by tolerance and the system response (i.e., the arising EM performance of interest), is not available in closed (or explicit) form. The method is a generalized analytic technique based on the Interval Analysis (IA). First, an analytic surrogate model (SM) of the TF is defined by means of a learning-by-example (LBE) approach starting from a set of available I/O examples. Then, the LBE-derived SM is extended to intervals through IA to yield inclusive, yet finite, performance bounds of the output system response when the control parameters are affected by unknown, but bounded, tolerances. A set of representative numerical examples is reported to validate the proposed IA-LBE method as well as to assess its effectiveness and reliability when dealing with realistic EM systems (e.g., antennas) for which the TF is not explicitly known.

This paper presents a case study on how TTM models impact music production, based on a user study of their effect on producers creative workflows. Participants produce tracks using a custom tool combining TTM and source separation models. Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis reveal key challenges, opportunities, and ethical considerations. The findings offer insights into the transformative potential of TTMs in music production, as well as challenges in their real-world integration.

Title: Optimizing the Network Topology of a Linear Reservoir Computer
Authors: Sahand Tangerami, Nicholas A. Mecholsky, Francesco Sorrentino
Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of a reservoir computer (RC) is generated at random, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the topology of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both the training and testing phases and also often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.

Title: S$^3$F-Net: A Multi-Modal Approach to Medical Image Classification via Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network
Authors: Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui, Mohammed Imamul Hassan Bhuiyan
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.

Authors: Lorenzo Italiano, Alireza Pourafzal, Hui Chen, Mattia Brambilla, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Monica Nicoli, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: The technological innovation towards 6G cellular networks introduces unprecedented capabilities for user equipment (UE) localization, but it also raises serious concerns about physical layer location privacy. This paper introduces HoloTrace, a signal-level privacy preservation framework that relies on user-side spoofing of localization-relevant features to prevent the extraction of precise location information from the signals received by a base station (BS) in a mmWave MIMO-OFDM system. Spoofing is performed by the user on location parameters such as angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD), and time difference of arrival (TDoA). Without requiring any protocol modification nor network-side support, our method strategically perturbs pilot transmissions to prevent a BS from performing non-consensual UE localization. The methodology allows the UE to spoof its position, keeping the precoder unchanged. We formulate spoofing as a unified rank-constrained projection problem, and provide closed-form solutions under varying levels of channel state information (CSI) at the UE, including scenarios with and without CSI knowledge. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach enables the UE to deceive the BS, inducing significant localization errors, while the impact on link capacity varies depending on the spoofed position. Our findings establish HoloTrace as a practical and robust privacy-preserving solution for future 6G networks.

Title: AudioFuse: Unified Spectral-Temporal Learning via a Hybrid ViT-1D CNN Architecture for Robust Phonocardiogram Classification
Authors: Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui, Utsab Saha
Abstract: Biomedical audio signals, such as phonocardiograms (PCG), are inherently rhythmic and contain diagnostic information in both their spectral (tonal) and temporal domains. Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.

Title: Theoretical framework of passive ME antenna arrays enabling in-vivo monitoring: A pathway to smart implants
Authors: Kalpesh Jaykar, Prasanth Velvaluri, Nian X. Sun, Richard D. James
Abstract: A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed far-field location through phase manipulation.

Title: Foundation Model-Based Adaptive Semantic Image Transmission for Dynamic Wireless Environments
Authors: Fangyu Liu, Peiwen Jiang, Wenjin Wang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin, Jun Zhang
Abstract: Foundation model-based semantic transmission has recently shown great potential in wireless image communication. However, existing methods exhibit two major limitations: (i) they overlook the varying importance of semantic components for specific downstream tasks, and (ii) they insufficiently exploit wireless domain knowledge, resulting in limited robustness under dynamic channel conditions. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a foundation model-based adaptive semantic image transmission system for dynamic wireless environments, such as autonomous driving. The proposed system decomposes each image into a semantic segmentation map and a compressed representation, enabling task-aware prioritization of critical objects and fine-grained textures. A task-adaptive precoding mechanism then allocates radio resources according to the semantic importance of extracted features. To ensure accurate channel information for precoding, a channel estimation knowledge map (CEKM) is constructed using a conditional diffusion model that integrates user position, velocity, and sparse channel samples to train scenario-specific lightweight estimators. At the receiver, a conditional diffusion model reconstructs high-quality images from the received semantic features, ensuring robustness against channel impairments and partial data loss. Simulation results on the BDD100K dataset with multi-scenario channels generated by QuaDRiGa demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality (SSIM, LPIPS, FID), task-specific accuracy (IoU), and transmission efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating task-aware semantic decomposition, scenario-adaptive channel estimation, and diffusion-based reconstruction for robust semantic transmission in dynamic wireless environments.

Title: Communication-aware Wide-Area Damping Control using Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Kyung-bin Kwon, Lintao Ye, Vijay Gupta, Hao Zhu
Abstract: Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or {cyber perturbations}. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax's convergence and VSCs' damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.

Title: Learnable Kernels for FRI - Joint Kernel Encoder Optimization and Hardware Validation
Authors: Omkar Nitsure, Sampath Kumar Dondapati, Satish Mulleti
Abstract: Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling techniques provide efficient frameworks for reconstructing signals with inherent sparsity at rates below Nyquist. However, traditional FRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on pre-defined kernels, often limiting hardware implementation and reconstruction accuracy under noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible, and practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing novel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective reconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and Gaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should have a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly optimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a unified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly outperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced sampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by representing kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly optimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our approach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a unity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal recovery. The developed convolutional neural network-based encoder substantially reduces computational complexity, demonstrating competitive performance with fewer parameters, making our method particularly suitable for resource-constrained, edge-based deployments.

Title: Joint Hybrid Beamforming and Artificial Noise Design for Secure Multi-UAV ISAC Networks
Authors: Runze Dong, Buhong Wang, Cunqian Feng, Jiang Weng, Chen Han, Jiwei Tian
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments. However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations, overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to benchmark schemes.

Title: Electric Vehicle Charger Infrastructure Planning: Demand Estimation, Coverage Optimization Over an Integrated Power Grid
Authors: Harshal D. Kaushik, Jingbo Wang, Roshni Anna Jacob, Jie Zhang
Abstract: For electrifying the transportation sector, deploying a strategically planned and efficient charging infrastructure is essential. This paper presents a two-phase approach for electric vehicle (EV) charger deployment that integrates spatial point-of-interest analysis and maximum coverage optimization over an integrated spatial power grid. Spatial-focused studies in the literature often overlook electrical grid constraints, while grid-focused work frequently considers statistically modeled EV charging demand. To address these gaps, a new framework is proposed that combines spatial network planning with electrical grid considerations. This study approaches EV charger planning from a perspective of the distribution grid, starting with an estimation of EV charging demand and the identification of optimal candidate locations. It ensures that the capacity limits of newly established chargers are maintained within the limits of the power grid. This framework is applied in a test case for the Dallas area, integrating the existing EV charger network with an 8500-bus distribution system for comprehensive planning.

Title: Real Time Fatigue Crack Growth Monitoring Using High Precision Control and Data Acquisition Systems
Authors: Arev Hambardzumyan, Rafayel Ghasabyan
Abstract: Fatigue cracks may initiate and propagate long before a structural component reaches the end of its nominal life. Detecting and quantifying crack growth in real time is critical for avoiding catastrophic failures in aerospace structures, nuclear reactors and civil infrastructure. This research reviews four widely used crack growth monitoring techniques: digital image correlation (DIC), acoustic emission (AE), compliance based methods and direct current potential drop (DCPD). The research evaluates their working principles, instrumentation, detection thresholds, noise sensitivities and suitability under various environmental conditions. Recent advances in high precision control and data acquisition systems (DAQs) that enable multi sensor data fusion are explored. The goal is to guide selection and integration of monitoring methods in modern structural health monitoring architectures.

Title: Expectation Propagation-Based Signal Detection for Highly Correlated MIMO Systems
Authors: Kabuto Arai, Takumi Yoshida, Takumi Takahashi, Koji Ishibashi
Abstract: Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically operate in dense array deployments with limited scattering environments, leading to highly correlated and ill-conditioned channel matrices that severely degrade the performance of message-passing-based detectors. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed overlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement vector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its overlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The resulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the denoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs from the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block correlation induced by high spatial correlation. The proposed algorithm is consistently derived within the EP framework, and its fixed point is theoretically proven to coincide with the stationary point of a relaxed Kullback- Leibler (KL) minimization problem. The mechanisms underlying the theoretically predicted performance improvement are further clarified through numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to conventional LMMSE-EP with lower computational complexity.

Title: Online Specific Emitter Identification via Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash
Authors: Hongyu Wang, Wenjia Xu, Guangzuo Li, Siyuan Wan, Yaohua Sun, Jiuniu Wang, Mugen Peng
Abstract: Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification (OSEI) task, comprising both online \revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot} learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task. The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\% and 8.55\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \revise{generalized zero-shot learning }tasks, respectively.

Title: LORT: Locally Refined Convolution and Taylor Transformer for Monaural Speech Enhancement
Authors: Junyu Wang, Zizhen Lin, Tianrui Wang, Meng Ge, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang
Abstract: Achieving superior enhancement performance while maintaining a low parameter count and computational complexity remains a challenge in the field of speech enhancement. In this paper, we introduce LORT, a novel architecture that integrates spatial-channel enhanced Taylor Transformer and locally refined convolution for efficient and robust speech enhancement. We propose a Taylor multi-head self-attention (T-MSA) module enhanced with spatial-channel enhancement attention (SCEA), designed to facilitate inter-channel information exchange and alleviate the spatial attention limitations inherent in Taylor-based Transformers. To complement global modeling, we further present a locally refined convolution (LRC) block that integrates convolutional feed-forward layers, time-frequency dense local convolutions, and gated units to capture fine-grained local details. Built upon a U-Net-like encoder-decoder structure with only 16 output channels in the encoder, LORT processes noisy inputs through multi-resolution T-MSA modules using alternating downsampling and upsampling operations. The enhanced magnitude and phase spectra are decoded independently and optimized through a composite loss function that jointly considers magnitude, complex, phase, discriminator, and consistency objectives. Experimental results on the VCTK+DEMAND and DNS Challenge datasets demonstrate that LORT achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with only 0.96M parameters, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world speech enhancement applications with limited computational resources.

Title: AISHELL6-whisper: A Chinese Mandarin Audio-visual Whisper Speech Dataset with Speech Recognition Baselines
Authors: Cancan Li, Fei Su, Juan Liu, Hui Bu, Yulong Wan, Hongbin Suo, Ming Li
Abstract: Whisper speech recognition is crucial not only for ensuring privacy in sensitive communications but also for providing a critical communication bridge for patients under vocal restraint and enabling discrete interaction in noise-sensitive environments. The development of Chinese mandarin audio-visual whisper speech recognition is hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets. We present AISHELL6-Whisper, a large-scale open-source audio-visual whisper speech dataset, featuring 30 hours each of whisper speech and parallel normal speech, with synchronized frontal facial videos. Moreover, we propose an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) baseline based on the Whisper-Flamingo framework, which integrates a parallel training strategy to align embeddings across speech types, and employs a projection layer to adapt to whisper speech's spectral properties. The model achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.13% for whisper speech and 1.11% for normal speech in the test set of our dataset, and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the wTIMIT benchmark. The dataset and the AVSR baseline codes are open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: Toward a Robust Biomimetic Hybrid Battery: Bridging Biology, Electrochemistry and Data-Driven Control
Authors: Raheel Ali, Rayid Ali
Abstract: Electric vehicles and renewable energy systems need batteries that charge quickly, last many years and still store a lot of energy, but current chemistries struggle to deliver all three. Inspired by electric fish that deliver bursts of current and birds that sleep with half their brains, we propose a hybrid battery concept called SwiftPulse. It combines sodium-ion cells that provide energy with niobium-oxide cells that accept high-power pulses. A pulse-based charger and a battery-management strategy rotate clusters of cells into rest so they can recover. We derive simple models of energy density, diffusion and capacity fade to show that a pack made mostly of sodium-ion modules with a smaller fraction of niobium-oxide modules could exceed 175 Wh per kg, endure more than ten thousand charge-discharge cycles and recharge to eighty percent in less than ten minutes. Simulations suggest that pulsed charging reduces ion buildup at the surface and slows degradation. We outline a roadmap for cell-level and module-level experiments and suggest integrating machine learning to adapt pulse parameters and rest scheduling. By blending ideas from biology, electrochemistry and data-driven control, this work points toward batteries that are safer, faster to charge and longer lasting.

Title: Asymptotic Expansion for Nonlinear Filtering in the Small System Noise Regime
Authors: Masahiro Kurisaki
Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.

Title: A University of Texas Medical Branch Case Study on Aortic Calcification Detection
Authors: Eric Walser, Peter McCaffrey, Kal Clark, Nicholas Czarnek
Abstract: This case study details The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)'s partnership with Zauron Labs, Inc. to enhance detection and coding of aortic calcifications (ACs) using chest radiographs. ACs are often underreported despite their significant prognostic value for cardiovascular disease, and UTMB partnered with Zauron to apply its advanced AI tools, including a high-performing image model (AUC = 0.938) and a fine-tuned language model based on Meta's Llama 3.2, to retrospectively analyze imaging and report data. The effort identified 495 patients out of 3,988 unique patients assessed (5,000 total exams) whose reports contained indications of aortic calcifications that were not properly coded for reimbursement (12.4% miscode rate) as well as an additional 84 patients who had aortic calcifications that were missed during initial review (2.1% misdiagnosis rate). Identification of these patients provided UTMB with the potential to impact clinical care for these patients and pursue $314k in missed annual revenue. These findings informed UTMB's decision to adopt Zauron's Guardian Pro software system-wide to ensure accurate, AI-enhanced peer review and coding, improving both patient care and financial solvency. This study is covered under University of Texas Health San Antonio's Institutional Review Board Study ID 00001887.

Title: Equation-Free Coarse Control of Distributed Parameter Systems via Local Neural Operators
Authors: Gianluca Fabiani, Constantinos Siettos, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis
Abstract: The control of high-dimensional distributed parameter systems (DPS) remains a challenge when explicit coarse-grained equations are unavailable. Classical equation-free (EF) approaches rely on fine-scale simulators treated as black-box timesteppers. However, repeated simulations for steady-state computation, linearization, and control design are often computationally prohibitive, or the microscopic timestepper may not even be available, leaving us with data as the only resource. We propose a data-driven alternative that uses local neural operators, trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic data, to obtain efficient short-time solution operators. These surrogates are employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum, yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without explicit Jacobian assembly. Both discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) controllers are based on this reduced system and lifted back to the full nonlinear dynamics, thereby closing the feedback loop.

Title: Frequency Control and Optimal Power Sharing in Combined Power and Heating Networks with Heat Pumps
Authors: Xin Qin, Ioannis Lestas
Abstract: Heat pumps have the capability for fast adjustments in power consumption with potential connections to large heating-inertia district heating networks, and are thus a very important resource for providing frequency support in low-inertia power systems. Nevertheless, the coupling of power networks with district heating systems renders the underlying dynamics much more involved. It is therefore important to ensure that system stability and appropriate power sharing are maintained. In this paper, we consider the problem of leveraging district heating systems as ancillary services for primary frequency control in power networks via heat pumps. We propose a novel power sharing scheme for heating systems based on the average temperature. This enables an optimal power allocation among diverse energy sources without requiring load disturbances information. We then discuss two approaches for heating systems to contribute to frequency regulation in power networks. We show that both approaches ensure stability in the combined heat and power network and facilitate optimal power allocation among the different energy sources. We also discuss how various generation dynamics can be incorporated into our framework with guaranteed stability and optimality. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate various tradeoffs in the transient response and the practical potential of the proposed approaches.

Title: Solar and Wind Power Forecasting: A Comparative Review of LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost Models
Authors: Afsaneh Mollasalehi, Armin Farhadi
Abstract: Rising global energy demand from population growth raises concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels. Consequently, the energy sector has increasingly transitioned to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are naturally abundant. However, the periodic and unpredictable nature of these resources pose significant challenges for power system reliability. Accurate forecasting is essential to ensure grid stability and optimize energy management. But due to the high variability in weather conditions which directly affected wind and solar energy, achieving precise predictions remains difficult. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), offer promising solutions to improve forecasting accuracy. The study highlights three widely used algorithms for solar and wind energy prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models are capable of learning complex patterns from historical and environmental data, enabling more accurate forecasts and contributing to the enhanced efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems. This review aims to provide an overview on RF, XGBoost, and LSTM by conducting a comparative analysis across three essential criteria: research prevalence, model complexity, and computational execution time.

Title: Wideband Integrated Sensing and Communications: Spectral Efficiency and Signaling Design
Authors: Henglin Pu, Zhu Han, Athina P. Petropulu, Husheng Li
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of 6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct functions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper, the ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large bandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of millimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of sensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It is proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating communication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the sensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the proposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform. Flattening the OTFS delay-axis PSD produces the same integrated sidelobe level (ISL) reduction effect in the delay-Doppler domain as PSD control achieves for OFDM in the frequency domain. To balance communication and sensing performance over frequency-selective channels, we propose a low-complexity, water-filling-like allocator with an explicit PSD-flatness (variance) constraint. The performance of the proposed wideband ISAC scheme is demonstrated using both numerical simulations and hardware experiments.

Title: BladderFormer: A Streaming Transformer for Real-Time Urological State Monitoring
Authors: Chengwei Zhou, Steve Majerus, Gourav Datta
Abstract: Bladder pressure monitoring systems are increasingly vital in diagnosing and managing urinary tract dysfunction. Existing solutions rely heavily on hand-crafted features and shallow classifiers, limiting their adaptability to complex signal dynamics. We propose a one-layer streaming transformer model for real-time classification of bladder pressure states, operating on wavelet-transformed representations of raw time-series data. Our model incorporates temporal multi-head self-attention and state caching, enabling efficient online inference with high adaptability. Trained on a dataset of 91 patients with 20,000-80,000 samples each, our method demonstrates improved accuracy, higher energy- and latency-efficiency. Implementation considerations for edge deployment on low-power hardware, such as edge graphical processing units (GPU) and micro-controllers, are also discussed.

Title: Reasoning Beyond Majority Vote: An Explainable SpeechLM Framework for Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Bo-Hao Su, Hui-Ying Shih, Jinchuan Tian, Jiatong Shi, Chi-Chun Lee, Carlos Busso, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is typically trained and evaluated on majority-voted labels, which simplifies benchmarking but masks subjectivity and provides little transparency into why predictions are made. This neglects valid minority annotations and limits interpretability. We propose an explainable Speech Language Model (SpeechLM) framework that frames SER as a generative reasoning task. Given an utterance, the model first produces a transcript, then outputs both an emotion label and a concise natural-language rationale grounded in lexical and acoustic cues. Rationales are generated by a reasoning-capable teacher LLM and used as intermediate supervision, combined with majority labels during fine-tuning. Unlike prior work primarily focused on boosting classification accuracy, we aim to enhance explainability while preserving competitive performance. To this end, we complement majority-label metrics with annotator-aware scoring that credits matches with any annotator label. On MSP-Podcast v1.12, our model maintains improvements over zero-shot SpeechLM baselines, and produces rationales that human evaluators find plausible and well grounded. This demonstrates that incorporating rationale supervision offers a practical path toward interpretable SER without sacrificing predictive quality.

Title: SDC-Based Model Predictive Control: Enhancing Computational Feasibility for Safety-Critical Quadrotor Control
Authors: Saber Omidi
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is widely used for controlling high-speed robotic systems such as quadrotors. However, its significant computational demands often hinder real-time feasibility and reliability, particularly in environments requiring robust obstacle avoidance. This paper proposes a novel SDC-Based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which preserves the high-precision performance of NMPC while substantially reducing computational complexity by over 30%. By reformulating the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics through the State-Dependent Coefficient (SDC) method, the original nonlinear program problem is transformed into a sequential quadratic optimization problem. The controller integrates an integral action to eliminate steady-state tracking errors and imposes constraints for safety-critical obstacle avoidance. Additionally, a disturbance estimator is incorporated to enhance robustness against external perturbations. Simulation results demonstrate that the SDC-Based MPC achieves comparable tracking accuracy to NMPC, with greater efficiency in terms of computation times, thereby improving its suitability for real-time applications. Theoretical analysis further establishes the stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed approach.

Title: Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning
Authors: Zhisheng Chen, Yingwei Zhang, Qizhen Lan, Tianyu Liu, Huacan Wang, Yi Ding, Ziyu Jia, Ronghao Chen, Kun Wang, Xinliang Zhou
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.

Title: Multi-Agent Guided Policy Search for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Games
Authors: Jingqi Li, Gechen Qu, Jason J. Choi, Somayeh Sojoudi, Claire Tomlin
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.

Title: Non-Invasive Detection of PROState Cancer with Novel Time-Dependent Diffusion MRI and AI-Enhanced Quantitative Radiological Interpretation: PROS-TD-AI

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk, improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa. Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust, zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care. This study protocol out-lines the rationale and describes the prospective evaluation of a home-developed AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software (PROSTDAI) in routine diagnostic care, assessing its added value against PI-RADS v2.1 and validating results against MRI-guided prostate biopsy.

Title: Adaptive Source-Channel Coding for Multi-User Semantic and Data Communications
Authors: Kai Yuan, Dongxu Li, Jianhao Huang, Han Zhang, Chuan Huang
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-user semantic and data communication (MU-SemDaCom) system, where a base station (BS) simultaneously serves users with different semantic and data tasks through a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) channel. The coexistence of heterogeneous communication tasks, diverse channel conditions, and the requirements for digital compatibility poses significant challenges to the efficient design of MU-SemDaCom systems. To address these issues, we propose a multi-user adaptive source-channel coding (MU-ASCC) framework that adaptively optimizes deep neural network (DNN)-based source coding, digital channel coding, and superposition broadcasting. First, we employ a data-regression method to approximate the end-to-end (E2E) semantic and data distortions, for which no closed-form expressions exist. The obtained logistic formulas decompose the E2E distortion as the addition of the source and channel distortion terms, in which the logistic parameter variations are task-dependent and jointly determined by both the DNN and channel parameters. Then, based on the derived formulas, we formulate a weighted-sum E2E distortion minimization problem that jointly optimizes the source-channel coding rates, power allocation, and beamforming vectors for both the data and semantic users. Finally, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is developed, where the adaptive rate optimization is solved using the subgradient descent method, while the joint power and beamforming is addressed via the uplink-downlink duality (UDD) technique. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) and deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) schemes that are designed for a single task, the proposed MU-ASCC scheme achieves simultaneous improvements in both the data recovery and semantic task performance.

Title: Small-Covariance Noise-to-State Stability of Stochastic Systems and Its Applications to Stochastic Gradient Dynamics
Authors: Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping Jiang, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: This paper studies gradient dynamics subject to additive random noise, which may arise from sources such as stochastic gradient estimation, measurement noise, or stochastic sampling errors. To analyze the robustness of such stochastic gradient systems, the concept of small-covariance noise-to-state stability (NSS) is introduced, along with a Lyapunov-based characterization. Furthermore, the classical Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on the objective function is generalized to the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition via comparison functions, thereby extending its applicability to a broader class of optimization problems. It is shown that the stochastic gradient dynamics exhibit small-covariance NSS if the objective function satisfies the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition and possesses a globally Lipschitz continuous gradient. This result implies that the trajectories of stochastic gradient dynamics converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with high probability, with the size of the neighborhood determined by the noise covariance. Moreover, if the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition is strengthened to a $\mathcal{K}_\infty$-PL condition, the dynamics are NSS; whereas if it is weakened to a general positive-definite-PL condition, the dynamics exhibit integral NSS. The results further extend to objectives without globally Lipschitz gradients through appropriate step-size tuning. The proposed framework is further applied to the robustness analysis of policy optimization for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and logistic regression.

Title: SynthCloner: Synthesizer Preset Conversion via Factorized Codec with ADSR Envelope Control
Authors: Jeng-Yue Liu, Ting-Chao Hsu, Yen-Tung Yeh, Li Su, Yi-Hsuan Yang
Abstract: Electronic synthesizer sounds are controlled by presets, parameters settings that yield complex timbral characteristics and ADSR envelopes, making preset conversion particularly challenging. Recent approaches to timbre transfer often rely on spectral objectives or implicit style matching, offering limited control over envelope shaping. Moreover, public synthesizer datasets rarely provide diverse coverage of timbres and ADSR envelopes. To address these gaps, we present SynthCloner, a factorized codec model that disentangles audio into three attributes: ADSR envelope, timbre, and content. This separation enables expressive synthesizer preset conversion with independent control over these three attributes. Additionally, we introduce SynthCAT, a new synthesizer dataset with a task-specific rendering pipeline covering 250 timbres, 120 ADSR envelopes, and 100 MIDI sequences. Experiments show that SynthCloner outperforms baselines on both objective and subjective metrics, while enabling independent attribute control. The code, model checkpoint, and audio examples are available at this https URL.

Title: Code-switching Speech Recognition Under the Lens: Model- and Data-Centric Perspectives
Authors: Hexin Liu, Haoyang Zhang, Qiquan Zhang, Xiangyu Zhang, Dongyuan Shi, Eng Siong Chng, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Code-switching automatic speech recognition (CS-ASR) presents unique challenges due to language confusion introduced by spontaneous intra-sentence switching and accent bias that blurs the phonetic boundaries. Although the constituent languages may be individually high-resource, the scarcity of annotated code-switching data further compounds these challenges. In this paper, we systematically analyze CS-ASR from both model-centric and data-centric perspectives. By comparing state-of-the-art algorithmic methods, including language-specific processing and auxiliary language-aware multi-task learning, we discuss their varying effectiveness across datasets with different linguistic characteristics. On the data side, we first investigate TTS as a data augmentation method. By varying the textual characteristics and speaker accents, we analyze the impact of language confusion and accent bias on CS-ASR. To further mitigate data scarcity and enhance textual diversity, we propose a prompting strategy by simplifying the equivalence constraint theory (SECT) to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating linguistically valid code-switching text. The proposed SECT outperforms existing methods in ASR performance and linguistic quality assessments, generating code-switching text that more closely resembles real-world code-switching text. When used to generate speech--text pairs via TTS, SECT proves effective in improving CS-ASR performance. Our analysis of both model- and data-centric methods underscores that effective CS-ASR requires strategies to be carefully aligned with the specific linguistic characteristics of the code-switching data.

Title: ReCon-GS: Continuum-Preserved Guassian Streaming for Fast and Compact Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes
Authors: Jiaye Fu, Qiankun Gao, Chengxiang Wen, Yanmin Wu, Siwei Ma, Jiaqi Zhang, Jian Zhang
Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations, thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations. Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization, while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels, enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Wavelet-Assisted Mamba for Satellite-Derived Sea Surface Temperature Super-Resolution
Authors: Wankun Chen, Feng Gao, Yanhai Gan, Jingchao Cao, Junyu Dong, Qian Du
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions. Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM) have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature, achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: N78 Frequency Band Modular RIS Design and Implementation
Authors: Sefa Kayraklık, Recep Baş, Hasan Oğuzhan Çalışkan, Samed Şahinoğlu, Sercan Erdoğan, İlhami Ünal, İbrahim Hökelek, Kıvanç Nurdan, Ali Görçin
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), capable of dynamically controlling wireless propagation characteristics using reflecting antenna elements, is a promising technology for enhancing signal coverage and improving end-user connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. This paper presents a complete design flow of a modular RIS prototype operating at the n78 frequency band, starting from the simulations to the prototype development and testing. An RIS prototype includes one master and up to sixteen slave blocks, each of which has an identical hardware structure with $8\times 8$ reflecting surface elements and a controller board. The phase shift response of each unit element is controlled with a PIN diode to form a $180^\circ$ phase difference between the ON and OFF states. The measurement experiment using two RIS blocks, horn antennas, and a vector network analyzer showed that the improvement of the received signal power is more than $15$ dB across the n78 frequency band for a given placement.

Title: Unsupervised Single-Channel Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior under Speaker-Embedding Guidance
Authors: Runwu Shi, Kai Li, Chang Li, Jiang Wang, Sihan Tan, Kazuhiro Nakadai
Abstract: Speech separation is a fundamental task in audio processing, typically addressed with fully supervised systems trained on paired mixtures. While effective, such systems typically rely on synthetic data pipelines, which may not reflect real-world conditions. Instead, we revisit the source-model paradigm, training a diffusion generative model solely on anechoic speech and formulating separation as a diffusion inverse problem. However, unconditional diffusion models lack speaker-level conditioning, they can capture local acoustic structure but produce temporally inconsistent speaker identities in separated sources. To address this limitation, we propose Speaker-Embedding guidance that, during the reverse diffusion process, maintains speaker coherence within each separated track while driving embeddings of different speakers further apart. In addition, we propose a new separation-oriented solver tailored for speech separation, and both strategies effectively enhance performance on the challenging task of unsupervised source-model-based speech separation, as confirmed by extensive experimental results. Audio samples and code are available at this https URL.

Title: Autonomous Detection and Coverage of Unknown Target Areas by Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Jie Song, Yang Bai, Mikhail Svinin, Naoki Wakamiya
Abstract: This paper presents a novel coverage control algorithm for multi-agent systems, where each agent has no prior knowledge of the specific region to be covered. The proposed method enables agents to autonomously detect the target area and collaboratively achieve full coverage. Once an agent detects a part of the target region within its sensor range, a dynamically constructed density function is generated to attract nearby agents. By integrating this density-driven mechanism with Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), the agents are guided to achieve optimal spatial distribution. Additionally, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are employed to ensure collision avoidance and maintain non-overlapping sensor coverage, enhancing both safety and efficiency. Simulation results verify that agents can independently locate and effectively cover the target area.

Title: Strong Basin of Attraction for Unmixing Kernels With the Variable Projection Method
Authors: Santos Michelena, Maxime Ferreira Da Costa, José Picheral
Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program. Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and validating the method's practical relevance.

Title: Assessing speech quality metrics for evaluation of neural audio codecs under clean speech conditions
Authors: Wolfgang Mack, Nezih Topaloglu, Laura Lechler, Ivana Balić, Alexandra Craciun, Mansur Yesilbursa, Kamil Wojcicki
Abstract: Objective speech-quality metrics are widely used to assess codec performance. However, for neural codecs, it is often unclear which metrics provide reliable quality estimates. To address this, we evaluated 45 objective metrics by correlating their scores with subjective listening scores for clean speech across 17 codec conditions. Neural-based metrics such as scoreq and utmos achieved the highest Pearson correlations with subjective scores. Further analysis across different subjective quality ranges revealed that non-intrusive metrics tend to saturate at high subjective quality levels.

Title: A Novel Preprocessing Unit for Effective Deep Learning based Classification and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy
Authors: Pranoti Nage, Sanjay Shitole
Abstract: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage, feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets: IDRiD and MESSIDOR.

Title: Low-Complexity Wireless Multi-Port Sensing by Multiplexed De-Embedding of an Over-the-Air Fixture
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and (ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii) by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying "multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.

Title: ISSE: An Instruction-Guided Speech Style Editing Dataset And Benchmark
Authors: Yun Chen, Qi Chen, Zheqi Dai, Arshdeep Singh, Philip J.B. Jackson, Mark D. Plumbley
Abstract: Speech style editing refers to modifying the stylistic properties of speech while preserving its linguistic content and speaker identity. However, most existing approaches depend on explicit labels or reference audio, which limits both flexibility and scalability. More recent attempts to use natural language descriptions remain constrained by oversimplified instructions and coarse style control. To address these limitations, we introduce an Instruction-guided Speech Style Editing Dataset (ISSE). The dataset comprises nearly 400 hours of speech and over 100,000 source-target pairs, each aligned with diverse and detailed textual editing instructions. We also build a systematic instructed speech data generation pipeline leveraging large language model, expressive text-to-speech and voice conversion technologies to construct high-quality paired samples. Furthermore, we train an instruction-guided autoregressive speech model on ISSE and evaluate it in terms of instruction adherence, timbre preservation, and content consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ISSE enables accurate, controllable, and generalizable speech style editing compared to other datasets. The project page of ISSE is available at this https URL.

Title: BARProp: Fast-Converging and Memory-Efficient RSS-Based Localization Algorithm for IoT
Authors: Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Muhammad Salman, Lismer Andres Caceres-Najarro
Abstract: Leveraging received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor localization is highly attractive due to their inherent availability in ubiquitous wireless protocols. However, prevailing RSS-based methods often depend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering them impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this paper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient localization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key innovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the decay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in a buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced stability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data demonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but also delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to existing benchmarks.

Title: Model-Free Dynamic Consensus in Multi-Agent Systems: A Q-Function Perspective
Authors: Maryam Babazadeh, Naim Bajcinca
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for achieving dynamic consensus in linear discrete-time homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with marginally stable or unstable dynamics. The guarantee of consensus in this setting involves a set of constraints based on the graph's spectral properties, complicating the design of the coupling gains. This challenge intensifies for large-scale systems with diverse graph Laplacian spectra. The proposed approach reformulates the dynamic consensus problem with a prescribed convergence rate using a state-action value function framework inspired by optimal control theory. Specifically, a synthetic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) formulation is introduced to encode the consensus objective, enabling its translation into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP is applicable in both model-based and model-free settings for jointly designing the local feedback and coupling gains. To handle the inherent non-convex feasibility conditions, a convex-concave decomposition strategy is employed. Adaptation of the method in a completely model-free set-up eliminates the need for system identification or knowledge of the agents' dynamics. Instead, it relies on input-state data collection and offers an entirely data-driven equivalent SDP formulation. Finally, a new algorithm balancing feasibility, convergence rate, robustness, and energy efficiency, is established to provide design flexibility. Numerical simulations validate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios.

Title: Word-Level Emotional Expression Control in Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Tianrui Wang, Haoyu Wang, Meng Ge, Cheng Gong, Chunyu Qiang, Ziyang Ma, Zikang Huang, Guanrou Yang, Xiaobao Wang, Eng Siong Chng, Xie Chen, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang
Abstract: While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.

Title: Hill-Type Stability Analysis of Periodic Solutions of Fractional-Order Differential Equations
Authors: Paul-Erik Haacker, Remco I. Leine, Renu Chaudhary, Kai Diethelm, André Schmidt, Safoura Hashemishahraki
Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear) fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however, a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.

Title: Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability
Authors: Shirantha Welikala, Hai Lin, Panos J. Antsaklis
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing some existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Title: Advancing Zero-Shot Open-Set Speech Deepfake Source Tracing
Authors: Manasi Chhibber, Jagabandhu Mishra, Tomi H. Kinnunen
Abstract: We propose a novel zero-shot source tracing framework inspired by advances in speaker verification. Specifically, we adapt the SSL-AASIST system for attack classification, ensuring that the attacks used for training are disjoint from those used to form fingerprint-trial pairs. For backend scoring in attack verification, we explore both zero-shot approaches (cosine similarity and Siamese) and few-shot approaches (MLP and Siamese). Experiments on our recently introduced STOPA dataset suggest that few-shot learning provides advantages in the closed-set scenario, while zero-shot approaches perform better in the open-set scenario. In closed-set trials, few-shot Siamese and MLP achieve equal error rates (EER) of 18.44% and 15.11%, compared to 27.14% for zero-shot cosine scoring. Conversely, in open-set trials, zero-shot cosine scoring reaches 21.70%, outperforming few-shot Siamese and MLP at 27.40% and 22.65%, respectively.

Title: Impedance Modeling of Magnetometers: A Path Toward Low-Noise Readout Circuits
Authors: Johan Arbustini, Eric Elzenheimer, Elizaveta Spetzler, Pablo Mendoza, Daniel Fernández, Jordi Madrenas, Jeffrey McCord, Michael Höft, Robert Rieger, Andreas Bahr
Abstract: Optimizing sensor readout schemes and integrated circuit designs for both open-loop and closed-loop implementations requires precise modeling and simulation strategies. This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model to estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model provides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating magnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation environments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types. Common S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer and converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level simulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related noise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog circuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with experimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the custom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model considerations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the transfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes for mixed-signal circuit design. This allows low-noise electronics to be designed and extended to other sensor interface electronics, broadening their applicability in high-performance magnetic sensing.

Title: SenSE: Semantic-Aware High-Fidelity Universal Speech Enhancement
Authors: Xingchen Li, Hanke Xie, Ziqian Wang, Zihan Zhang, Longshuai Xiao, Lei Xie
Abstract: Generative universal speech enhancement (USE) methods aim to leverage generative models to improve speech quality under various types of distortions. Diffusion- or flow-based generative models are capable of producing enhanced speech with high quality and fidelity. However, they typically achieve speech enhancement by learning an acoustic feature mapping from degraded speech to clean speech, while lacking awareness of high-level semantic information. This deficiency tends to cause semantic ambiguity and acoustic discontinuities in the enhanced speech. In contrast, humans can often comprehend heavily corrupted speech by relying on semantic priors, suggesting that semantics play a crucial role in speech enhancement. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SenSE, which leverages a language model to capture the semantic information of distorted speech and effectively integrates it into a flow-matching-based speech enhancement framework. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware speech language model to capture the semantics of degraded speech and generate semantic tokens. We then design a semantic guidance mechanism that incorporates semantic information into the flow-matching-based speech enhancement process, effectively mitigating semantic ambiguity. In addition, we propose a prompt guidance mechanism, which leverages a short reference utterance to alleviate the loss of speaker similarity under severe distortion conditions. The results of several benchmark data sets demonstrate that SenSE not only ensures high perceptual quality but also substantially improves speech fidelity while maintaining strong robustness under severe distortions. Codes and demos are available.

Title: Position estimation based on UWB swarm optimization and comparison against traditional trilateration
Authors: Vinish Yogesh, Bert-Jan van Beijnum, Jaap H. Buurke, Chris T. M. Baten
Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a promising technology for indoor position estimation for various localization applications of object swarms, such as in 3D analysis of human movement with multiple on-body sensors or a swarm of drones in an indoor environment. However, most UWB-only position estimation methods are based on a star topology, where the position of a mobile node is estimated using distances from several fixed anchors. These approaches ignore the valuable inter-node distance estimates, possible in a fully-connected 'Swarm' topology, which could provide more redundancy in the set of available distance estimates used for the position estimation. This would improve the accuracy and consistency of the position estimates. Also, published studies do not analyze how input measurement errors affect the final position estimates, which makes it difficult to assess the reliability under varying conditions. Therefore, this study first proposes a UWB swarm optimization-based position estimation method that utilizes all available internode distances to enhance accuracy and compare against the traditional trilateration method that utilizes the star configuration. All validations were done with synthetic UWB data, to enable testing all input error situations. The comprehensive error sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate its robustness under varying noise conditions. The proposed method consistently outperformed trilateration, with position estimation error around 5.7 cm for realistic UWB distance input estimates, while for higher noise conditions, the proposed method had errors around 6 cm lower than the trilateration method, which had position estimation errors around 19 cm. This study demonstrates the general potential of the Swarm optimization-based method for position estimation as a more accurate and consistent alternative to traditional star-based trilateration methods.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Energy Decay Curves from Room Geometry and Material Properties
Authors: Imran Muhammad, Gerald Schuller
Abstract: Accurate prediction of energy decay curves (EDCs) enables robust analysis of room acoustics and reliable estimation of key parameters. We present a deep learning framework that predicts EDCs directly from room geometry and surface absorption. A dataset of 6000 shoebox rooms with realistic dimensions, source-receiver placements, and frequency-dependent wall absorptions was synthesized. For each configuration we simulate room impulse responses (RIRs) using Pyroomacoustics and compute target EDCs. Normalized room features are provided to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that maps configuration to EDC. Performance is evaluated with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) over time. We further derive early decay time (EDT), reverberation time (T20), and clarity index (C50) from predicted and target EDCs; close agreement is observed (e.g., EDT MAE 0.017 s, T20 MAE 0.021 s). The approach generalizes across diverse rooms and supports efficient room-acoustics modeling for early-stage design and real-time applications.

Title: VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning
Authors: Xin Cheng, Yuyue Wang, Xihua Wang, Yihan Wu, Kaisi Guan, Yijing Chen, Peng Zhang, Xiaojiang Liu, Meng Cao, Ruihua Song
Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.

Title: Event-Driven Control via Sparsity-Promoting Regularization: A Rollout Approach with Performance Guarantees
Authors: Shumpei Nishida, Kunihisa Okano
Abstract: This paper presents a controller design method aiming to balance control performance and actuation frequency. In this framework, actuation timings are determined in an event-driven manner, resulting in intermittent control actions. Control performance is measured by an infinite-horizon average cost, and input sparsity is promoted through actuation-rate regularization. Since the formulated optimal control problem has a combinatorial nature, we employ a rollout algorithm to find a suboptimal solution. In the proposed scheme, the event-triggering condition is derived through a multistage minimization procedure using a receding-horizon approach. We establish theoretical performance bounds with respect to periodic control and prove the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.

Title: RDD: Pareto Analysis of the Rate-Distortion-Distinguishability Trade-off
Authors: Andriy Enttsel, Alex Marchioni, Andrea Zanellini, Mauro Mangia, Gianluca Setti, Riccardo Rovatti
Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.

Title: Intelligent Optimization of Wireless Access Point Deployment for Communication-Based Train Control Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Kunyu Wu, Qiushi Zhao, Zihan Feng, Yunxi Mu, Hao Qin, Xinyu Zhang, Xingqi Zhang
Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control (CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions, significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling, and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

Title: Room Impulse Response Prediction with Neural Networks: From Energy Decay Curves to Perceptual Validation
Authors: Imran Muhammad, Gerald Schuller
Abstract: Prediction of room impulse responses (RIRs) is essential for room acoustics, spatial audio, and immersive applications, yet conventional simulations and measurements remain computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work proposes a neural network framework that predicts energy decay curves (EDCs) from room dimensions, material absorption coefficients, and source-receiver positions, and reconstructs corresponding RIRs via reverse-differentiation. A large training dataset was generated using room acoustic simulations with realistic geometries, frequency-dependent absorption, and diverse source-receiver configurations. Objective evaluation employed root mean squared error (RMSE) and a custom loss for EDCs, as well as correlation, mean squared error (MSE), spectral similarity for reconstructed RIRs. Perceptual validation through a MUSHRA listening test confirmed no significant perceptual differences between predicted and reference RIRs. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides accurate and perceptually reliable RIR predictions, offering a scalable solution for practical acoustic modeling and audio rendering applications.

Title: SAGA-SR: Semantically and Acoustically Guided Audio Super-Resolution
Authors: Jaekwon Im, Juhan Nam
Abstract: Versatile audio super-resolution (SR) aims to predict high-frequency components from low-resolution audio across diverse domains such as speech, music, and sound effects. Existing diffusion-based SR methods often fail to produce semantically aligned outputs and struggle with consistent high-frequency reconstruction. In this paper, we propose SAGA-SR, a versatile audio SR model that combines semantic and acoustic guidance. Based on a DiT backbone trained with a flow matching objective, SAGA-SR is conditioned on text and spectral roll-off embeddings. Due to the effective guidance provided by its conditioning, SAGA-SR robustly upsamples audio from arbitrary input sampling rates between 4 kHz and 32 kHz to 44.1 kHz. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that SAGA-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance across all test cases. Sound examples and code for the proposed model are available online.

Title: Low-Complexity Receiver Design for Multicarrier CAPA-based Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels
Authors: Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Emil Björnson
Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity receiver design for multicarrier continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. The receiver leverages a Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP)-based framework that hinges only on element-wise scalar operations for the detection of the transmitted symbols. Simulation results for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveforms demonstrate significant performance improvements in terms of uncoded bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional discrete antenna array systems, while maintaining very low computational complexity.

Title: Coordinated vs. Sequential Transmission Planning
Authors: Maya Domeshek, Christoph Graf, Burçin Ünel
Abstract: Coordinated planning of generation, storage, and transmission more accurately captures the interactions among these three capacity types necessary to meet electricity demand, at least in theory. However, in practice, U.S. system operators typically follow a sequential planning approach: They first determine future generation and storage additions based on an assumed unconstrained (`copper plate') system. Next, they perform dispatch simulations of this projected generation and storage capacity mix on the existing transmission grid to identify transmission constraint violations. These violations indicate the need for transmission upgrades. We describe a multistage, multi-locational planning model that co-optimizes generation, storage, and transmission investments. The model respects reliability constraints as well as state energy and climate policies. We test the two planning approaches using a current stakeholder-informed 20-zone model of the PJM region, developed for the current FERC Order No. 1920 compliance filing process. In our most conservative model specification, we find that the co-optimized approach estimates 67% lower transmission upgrade needs than the sequential model, leading to total system costs that are .6% lower and similar reliability and climate outcomes. Our sensitivities show larger transmission and cost savings and reliability and climate benefits from co-optimized planning.

Title: Spectral Flow Learning Theory: Finite-Sample Guarantees for Vector-Field Identification
Authors: Chi Ho Leung, Philip E. Paré
Abstract: We study the identification of continuous-time vector fields from irregularly sampled trajectories. We introduce Spectral Flow Learning (SFL), which learns in a windowed flow space using a lag-linear label operator that aggregates lagged Koopman actions. We provide finite-sample high-probability (FS-HP) guarantees for the class of variable-step linear multistep methods (vLLM). The FS-HP rates are constructed using spectral regularization with qualification-controlled filters for flow predictors under standard source and filter assumptions. A multistep observability inequality links flow error to vector-field error and yields two-term bounds that combine a statistical rate with an explicit discretization bias from vLMM theory. This preliminary preprint states the results and sketches proofs, with full proofs and extensions deferred to a journal version.

Title: Real-Time Power electronics Control and Monitoring with TI F28379D DSC and GUI Composer
Authors: Ilyas Bennia, Lotfi Baghli, Ehsan Jamshidpour, Abdelkader Mechernene, Jean-Philippe Martin, Driss Yousfi
Abstract: This paper details the implementation and experimental validation of a real-time control system for a three-phase induction motor using the Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D microcontroller. The system integrates pulse-width modulation (PWM) generation, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and quadrature encoder feedback to facilitate precise control under various strategies. A current sensing solution based on the AMC1301 isolation amplifier and shunt resistor ensures accurate and safe current measurement for feedback loops. Two control algorithms, V/f and Field-Oriented Control (FOC) are implemented and tested. Real-time parameter tuning and data visualization are achieved using GUI Composer, enabling efficient system debugging and interaction. Experimental results demonstrate smooth speed reversal, fast dynamic response, and stable performance under both step and multi-step inputs. While GUI Composer effectively supports general monitoring and control, limitations in signal bandwidth are noted compared to professional-grade platforms. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the implemented control strategies for high-performance induction motor applications.

Title: Real-Time Estimation of Equivalent Series Resistance for Predicting Output Capacitor Failures in Boost Converters
Authors: Antonino pagano
Abstract: Output capacitors are among the most critical components in power electronic converters, as their degradation directly affects system stability and reliability. A key indicator of capacitor health is the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), whose progressive increase is strongly correlated with aging and imminent failure. This paper presents a real-time technique for estimating the ESR of output capacitors in boost converters, with the aim of enabling early fault prediction and condition-based maintenance. The proposed method leverages online parameter estimation to extract ESR values without interrupting converter operation. The estimation algorithm has been implemented on a low-cost STM32 Nucleo platform, demonstrating both computational efficiency and suitability for embedded applications. Experimental validation confirms that the approach provides accurate ESR tracking under varying load and operating conditions, allowing timely detection of abnormal capacitor behavior and preventing unexpected system failures.

Title: Safety-Critical Input-Constrained Nonlinear Intercept Guidance in Multiple Engagement Zones
Authors: Praveen Kumar Ranjan, Abhinav Sinha, Yongcan Cao
Abstract: This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable. The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function (log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.

Title: Data-Driven Resilience Assessment against Sparse Sensor Attacks
Authors: Takumi Shinohara, Karl Henrik Johansson, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for assessing the attack resilience of linear time-invariant systems against malicious false data injection sensor attacks. Based on the concept of sparse observability, data-driven resilience metrics are proposed. First, we derive a data-driven necessary and sufficient condition for assessing the system's resilience against sensor attacks, using data collected without any attacks. If we obtain attack-free data that satisfy a specific rank condition, we can exactly evaluate the attack resilience level even in a model-free setting. We then extend this analysis to a scenario where only poisoned data are available. Given the poisoned data, we can only conservatively assess the system's resilience. In both scenarios, we also provide polynomial-time algorithms to assess the system resilience under specific conditions. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the efficacy and limitations of the proposed framework.

Title: Benchmarking ECG Foundational Models: A Reality Check Across Clinical Tasks
Authors: M A Al-Masud, Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using 12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets. Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB, dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.

Title: Data-Driven Optimal Power Flow: A Behavioral Systems Approach
Authors: Sebastian Otzen, Hannes M. H. Wolf, Christian A. Hans
Abstract: The increasing decentralization of power systems driven by a large number of renewable energy sources poses challenges in power flow optimization. Partially unknown power line properties can render model-based approaches unsuitable. With increasing deployment of sensors, data-driven methods rise as a promising alternative. They offer the flexibility to adapt to varying grid structures and unknown line properties. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven representation of nonlinear power flow equations for radial grids based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma. The approach allows for direct integration of input/output data into power flow optimisation, enabling cost minimization and constraint enforcement without requiring explicit knowledge of the electrical properties or the topology of the grid. Moreover, we formulate a convex relaxation to ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art solvers. In a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the novel approach performs similar to state-of-the-art methods, without the need for an explicit system identification step.

Title: Efficient Speech Watermarking for Speech Synthesis via Progressive Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Yang Cui, Peter Pan, Lei He, Sheng Zhao
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of speech generative models, unauthorized voice cloning poses significant privacy and security risks. Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.

Title: GOAT: A Large Dataset of Paired Guitar Audio Recordings and Tablatures
Authors: Jackson Loth, Pedro Sarmento, Saurjya Sarkar, Zixun Guo, Mathieu Barthet, Mark Sandler
Abstract: In recent years, the guitar has received increased attention from the music information retrieval (MIR) community driven by the challenges posed by its diverse playing techniques and sonic characteristics. Mainly fueled by deep learning approaches, progress has been limited by the scarcity and limited annotations of datasets. To address this, we present the Guitar On Audio and Tablatures (GOAT) dataset, comprising 5.9 hours of unique high-quality direct input audio recordings of electric guitars from a variety of different guitars and players. We also present an effective data augmentation strategy using guitar amplifiers which delivers near-unlimited tonal variety, of which we provide a starting 29.5 hours of audio. Each recording is annotated using guitar tablatures, a guitar-specific symbolic format supporting string and fret numbers, as well as numerous playing techniques. For this we utilise both the Guitar Pro format, a software for tablature playback and editing, and a text-like token encoding. Furthermore, we present competitive results using GOAT for MIDI transcription and preliminary results for a novel approach to automatic guitar tablature transcription. We hope that GOAT opens up the possibilities to train novel models on a wide variety of guitar-related MIR tasks, from synthesis to transcription to playing technique detection.

Title: Trust and Transparency in AI: Industry Voices on Data, Ethics, and Compliance
Authors: Louise McCormack, Diletta Huyskes, Dave Lewis, Malika Bendechache
Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act directs businesses to assess their AI systems to ensure they are developed in a way that is human-centered and trustworthy. The rapid adoption of AI in the industry has outpaced ethical evaluation frameworks, leading to significant challenges in accountability, governance, data quality, human oversight, technological robustness, and environmental and societal impacts. Through structured interviews with fifteen industry professionals, paired with a literature review conducted on each of the key interview findings, this paper investigates practical approaches and challenges in the development and assessment of Trustworthy AI (TAI). The findings from participants in our study, and the subsequent literature reviews, reveal complications in risk management, compliance and accountability, which are exacerbated by a lack of transparency, unclear regulatory requirements and a rushed implementation of AI. Participants reported concerns that technological robustness and safety could be compromised by model inaccuracies, security vulnerabilities, and an overreliance on AI without proper safeguards in place. Additionally, the negative environmental and societal impacts of AI, including high energy consumption, political radicalisation, loss of culture and reinforcement of social inequalities, are areas of concern. There is a pressing need not just for risk mitigation and TAI evaluation within AI systems but for a wider approach to developing an AI landscape that aligns with the social and cultural values of the countries adopting those technologies.

Title: DiaMoE-TTS: A Unified IPA-Based Dialect TTS Framework with Mixture-of-Experts and Parameter-Efficient Zero-Shot Adaptation
Authors: Ziqi Chen, Gongyu Chen, Yihua Wang, Chaofan Ding, Zihao chen, Wei-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable, open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

Title: Prompt-aware classifier free guidance for diffusion models
Authors: Xuanhao Zhang, Chang Li
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image and audio generation, largely due to Classifier-Free Guidance. However, the choice of guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference. Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity, alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained diffusion backbones.

Title: Red Teaming Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Standards: A Penetration Testing Framework Integrating AI and Quantum Security
Authors: Petar Radanliev
Abstract: This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.

Title: Text-Independent Speaker Identification Using Audio Looping With Margin Based Loss Functions
Authors: Elliot Q C Garcia, Nicéias Silva Vilela, Kátia Pires Nascimento do Sacramento, Tiago A. E. Ferreira
Abstract: Speaker identification has become a crucial component in various applications, including security systems, virtual assistants, and personalized user experiences. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of CosFace Loss and ArcFace Loss for text-independent speaker identification using a Convolutional Neural Network architecture based on the VGG16 model, modified to accommodate mel spectrogram inputs of variable sizes generated from the Voxceleb1 dataset. Our approach involves implementing both loss functions to analyze their effects on model accuracy and robustness, where the Softmax loss function was employed as a comparative baseline. Additionally, we examine how the sizes of mel spectrograms and their varying time lengths influence model performance. The experimental results demonstrate superior identification accuracy compared to traditional Softmax loss methods. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for future research.

Authors: Pietro Bruschi
Abstract: In-Orbit Servicing and Active Debris Removal require advanced robotic capabilities for capturing and detumbling uncooperative targets. This work presents a hierarchical control framework for autonomous robotic capture of tumbling objects in space. A simulation environment is developed, incorporating sloshing dynamics of the chaser, a rarely studied effect in space robotics. The proposed controller combines an inner Lyapunov-based robust control loop for multi-body dynamics with an outer loop addressing an extended inverse kinematics problem. Simulation results show improved robustness and adaptability compared to existing control schemes.

Title: Safe Task Space Synchronization with Time-Delayed Information
Authors: Rounak Bhattacharya, Vrithik R. Guthikonda, Ashwin P. Dani
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with safety constraints.

Title: Physically Plausible Multi-System Trajectory Generation and Symmetry Discovery
Authors: Jiayin Liu, Yulong Yang, Vineet Bansal, Christine Allen-Blanchette
Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.

Title: MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning
Authors: Charles L. Wang
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Title: Simulated Annealing for Multi-Robot Ergodic Information Acquisition Using Graph-Based Discretization
Authors: Benjamin Wong, Aaron Weber, Mohamed M. Safwat, Santosh Devasia, Ashis G. Banerjee
Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

Title: Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Po-Heng Chou
Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.

We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocations in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packets. This letter provides the guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and buffer threshold of the LAA systems.

Title: Markov Modeling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Underlay and Overlay D2D
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Yen-Ting Liu, Wei-Chang Chen, Walid Saad
Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular, and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay scheme.

Title: SAC-Loco: Safe and Adjustable Compliant Quadrupedal Locomotion
Authors: Aoqian Zhang, Zixuan Zhuang, Chunzheng Wang, Shuzhi Sam Ge, Fan Shi, Cheng Xiang
Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies. Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

Title: Leave No Observation Behind: Real-time Correction for VLA Action Chunks
Authors: Kohei Sendai, Maxime Alvarez, Tatsuya Matsushima, Yutaka Matsuo, Yusuke Iwasawa
Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.

Title: A Generative Model for Controllable Feature Heterophily in Graphs
Authors: Haoyu Wang, Renyuan Ma, Gonzalo Mateos, Luana Ruiz
Abstract: We introduce a principled generative framework for graph signals that enables explicit control of feature heterophily, a key property underlying the effectiveness of graph learning methods. Our model combines a Lipschitz graphon-based random graph generator with Gaussian node features filtered through a smooth spectral function of the rescaled Laplacian. We establish new theoretical guarantees: (i) a concentration result for the empirical heterophily score; and (ii) almost-sure convergence of the feature heterophily measure to a deterministic functional of the graphon degree profile, based on a graphon-limit law for polynomial averages of Laplacian eigenvalues. These results elucidate how the interplay between the graphon and the filter governs the limiting level of feature heterophily, providing a tunable mechanism for data modeling and generation. We validate the theory through experiments demonstrating precise control of homophily across graph families and spectral filters.

Title: WavJEPA: Semantic learning unlocks robust audio foundation models for raw waveforms
Authors: Goksenin Yuksel, Pierre Guetschel, Michael Tangermann, Marcel van Gerven, Kiki van der Heijden
Abstract: Learning audio representations from raw waveforms overcomes key limitations of spectrogram-based audio representation learning, such as the long latency of spectrogram computation and the loss of phase information. Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.

Title: RIS- and Multi-Snapshot-Enabled SISO 3D Position and Velocity Estimation With Single Base Station
Authors: Yirun Wang, Yongqing Wang, Yuyao Shen, Gongpu Wang, Chintha Tellambura
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS) anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this, we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements. Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to passive RIS.

Title: MeanFlowSE: One-Step Generative Speech Enhancement via MeanFlow

Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) recovers clean speech from noisy signals and is vital for applications such as telecommunications and automatic speech recognition (ASR). While generative approaches achieve strong perceptual quality, they often rely on multi-step sampling (diffusion/flow-matching) or large language models, limiting real-time deployment. To mitigate these constraints, we present MeanFlowSE, a one-step generative SE framework. It adopts MeanFlow to predict an average-velocity field for one-step latent refinement and conditions the model on self-supervised learning (SSL) representations rather than VAE latents. This design accelerates inference and provides robust acoustic-semantic guidance during training. In the Interspeech 2020 DNS Challenge blind test set and simulated test set, MeanFlowSE attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) level perceptual quality and competitive intelligibility while significantly lowering both real-time factor (RTF) and model size compared with recent generative competitors, making it suitable for practical use. The code will be released upon publication at this https URL.

Title: Emotional Styles Hide in Deep Speaker Embeddings: Disentangle Deep Speaker Embeddings for Speaker Clustering
Authors: Chaohao Lin, Xu Zheng, Kaida Wu, Peihao Xiang, Ou Bai
Abstract: Speaker clustering is the task of identifying the unique speakers in a set of audio recordings (each belonging to exactly one speaker) without knowing who and how many speakers are present in the entire data, which is essential for speaker diarization processes. Recently, off-the-shelf deep speaker embedding models have been leveraged to capture speaker characteristics. However, speeches containing emotional expressions pose significant challenges, often affecting the accuracy of speaker embeddings and leading to a decline in speaker clustering performance. To tackle this problem, we propose DTG-VAE, a novel disentanglement method that enhances clustering within a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework. This study reveals a direct link between emotional states and the effectiveness of deep speaker embeddings. As demonstrated in our experiments, DTG-VAE extracts more robust speaker embeddings and significantly enhances speaker clustering performance.

Title: Efficient Norm-Based Reachable Sets via Iterative Dynamic Programming
Authors: Akash Harapanahalli, Samuel Coogan
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical optimal control framework for reachable set computation using \emph{normotopes}, a new set representation as a norm ball with a shaping matrix. In reachable set computations, we expect to continuously vary the shape matrix as a function of time. Incorporating the shape dynamics as an input, we build a \emph{controlled embedding system} using a linear differential inclusion overapproximating the dynamics of the system, where a single forward simulation of this embedding system always provides an overapproximating reachable set of the system, no matter the choice of \emph{hypercontrol}. By iteratively solving a linear quadratic approximation of the nonlinear optimal hypercontrol problem, we synthesize less conservative final reachable sets, providing a natural tradeoff between runtime and accuracy. Terminating our algorithm at any point always returns a valid reachable set overapproximation.

Title: AudioRole: An Audio Dataset for Character Role-Playing in Large Language Models
Authors: Wenyu Li, Xiaoqi Jiao, Yi Chang, Guangyan Zhang, Yiwen Guo
Abstract: The creation of high-quality multimodal datasets remains fundamental for advancing role-playing capabilities in large language models (LLMs). While existing works predominantly focus on text-based persona simulation, Audio Role-Playing (ARP) presents unique challenges due to the need for synchronized alignment of semantic content and vocal characteristics. To address this gap, we propose AudioRole, a meticulously curated dataset from 13 TV series spanning 1K+ hours with 1M+ character-grounded dialogues, providing synchronized audio-text pairs annotated with speaker identities and contextual metadata. In addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we introduced ARP-Eval, a dual-aspect evaluation framework that assesses both response quality and role fidelity. Empirical validation showing GLM-4-Voice trained on AudioRole (which we called ARP-Model) achieve an average Acoustic Personalization score of 0.31, significantly outperforming the original GLM-4-voice and the more powerful model MiniCPM-O-2.6, which specifically supports role-playing in one-shot scenarios. The ARP-Model also achieves a Content Personalization score of 0.36, surpassing the untrained original model by about 38% and maintaining the same level as MiniCPM-O-2.6. AudioRole features dialogues from over 115 main characters, 6 trained ARP-Models that role-play different characters, and evaluation protocols. Together, they provide an essential resource for advancing audio-grounded role-playing research.

Title: Robust Orientation Estimation with TRIAD-aided Manifold EKF
Authors: Arjun Sadananda, Ravi Banavar, Kavi Arya
Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our results with experiments.

Title: Distributionally robust LMI synthesis for LTI systems
Authors: Dennis Gramlich, Shuhao Yan, Carsten W. Scherer, Christian Ebenbauer%
Abstract: This article shows that distributionally robust controller synthesis as investigated in \cite{taskesen2024distributionally} can be formulated as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) synthesis problem. To this end, we rely on well-established convexification techniques from robust control. The LMI synthesis problem we propose has the advantage that it can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf semi-definite programming (SDP) solvers. In addition, our formulation exposes the studied distributionally robust controller synthesis problem as an instance of robust $H_2$ synthesis.

Title: Eye-Tracking and BCI Integration for Assistive Communication in Locked-In Syndrome: Pilot Study with Healthy Participants
Authors: Ana Patrícia Pinto, Rute Bettencourt, Urbano J. Nunes, Gabriel Pires
Abstract: Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) progressively lose voluntary motor control, often leading to a Locked-In State (LIS), or in severe cases, a Completely Locked-in State (CLIS). Eye-tracking (ET) systems are common communication tools in early LIS but become ineffective as oculomotor function declines. EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a non-muscular communication alternative, but delayed adoption may reduce performance due to diminished goal-directed thinking. This study presents a preliminary hybrid BCI framework combining ET and BCI to support a gradual transition between modalities. A group of five healthy participants tested a modified P300-based BCI. Gaze and EEG data were processed in real time, and an ET-BCI fusion algorithm was proposed to enhance detection of user intention. Results indicate that combining both modalities may maintain high accuracy and offers insights on how to potentially improve communication continuity for patients transitioning from LIS to CLIS.

Title: EEG-Based Framework for Reflexive and Perceptual Assessment in CLIS: Preliminary Study in Healthy Volunteers
Authors: Nicoli Leal, Rute Bettencourt, Urbano J. Nunes, Gabriel Pires
Abstract: Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions, working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive assessment at both levels.

Title: Robustness of 'small' networks
Authors: Jessica Jiang, Allison C. Zhuang, Petter Holme, Peter J. Mucha, Alice C. Schwarze
Abstract: Modeling how networks change under structural perturbations can yield foundational insights into network robustness, which is critical in many real-world applications. The largest connected component is a popular measure of network performance. Percolation theory provides a theoretical framework to establish statistical properties of the largest connected component of large random graphs. However, this theoretical framework is typically only exact in the large-$\nodes$ limit, failing to capture the statistical properties of largest connected components in small networks, which many real-world networks are. We derive expected values for the largest connected component of small $G(\nodes,p)$ random graphs from which nodes are either removed uniformly at random or targeted by highest degree and compare these values with existing theory. We also visualize the performance of our expected values compared to existing theory for predicting the largest connected component of various real-world, small graphs.

Title: LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models
Authors: Shubhang Bhatnagar, Andy Xu, Kar-Han Tan, Narendra Ahuja
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Title: A quantitative analysis of intraventricular bioimpedance in an in vivo pilot study with contextual pressure measurements
Authors: Fabian Flürenbrock, Christian T. Stoeck, Markus F. Oertel, Miriam Weisskopf, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Marianne Schmid Daners, Leonie Korn
Abstract: Hydrocephalus is a neurological condition characterized by disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and is typically treated with shunt systems that drain excessive CSF out of the ventricular system. Continuous monitoring of ventricular CSF volume, however, remains a major unmet need in the clinical management of this condition. While intraventricular bioimpedance (BI) has been proposed as a potential marker of CSF volume, prior investigations have been limited to simulations, in vitro phantoms, and small animal models. This work presents the development of a measurement system for intraventricular BI and its evaluation in a large animal model. The measurement system was first validated in vitro using a mechatronic test bench replicating physiological CSF dynamics and subsequently applied in an in vivo pilot study with concurrent CSF and blood pressure monitoring. Time series analysis of the recorded signals revealed physiological BI waveform components linked to the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In addition, changes in BI following CSF volume alterations induced through intrathecal bolus infusions of artificial CSF were observed and found to be correlated to changes in CSF and blood pressures. These results provide the first in vivo evidence in a large animal model that BI reflects CSF dynamics as well as cerebral hemodynamics. Complementing intracranial pressure and CSF drainage measurements in smart shunt systems with BI could enable more comprehensive patient monitoring and physiologically informed control of hydrocephalus therapy.

Title: Disentangling Score Content and Performance Style for Joint Piano Rendering and Transcription
Authors: Wei Zeng, Junchuan Zhao, Ye Wang
Abstract: Expressive performance rendering (EPR) and automatic piano transcription (APT) are fundamental yet inverse tasks in music information retrieval: EPR generates expressive performances from symbolic scores, while APT recovers scores from performances. Despite their dual nature, prior work has addressed them independently. In this paper we propose a unified framework that jointly models EPR and APT by disentangling note-level score content and global performance style representations from both paired and unpaired data. Our framework is built on a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and is trained using only sequence-aligned data, without requiring fine-grained note-level alignment. To automate the rendering process while ensuring stylistic compatibility with the score, we introduce an independent diffusion-based performance style recommendation module that generates style embeddings directly from score content. This modular component supports both style transfer and flexible rendering across a range of expressive styles. Experimental results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance on EPR and APT tasks, while enabling effective content-style disentanglement, reliable style transfer, and stylistically appropriate rendering.

Title: Integrated Communication and Control for Energy-Efficient UAV Swarms: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Tianjiao Sun, Ningyan Guo, Haozhe Gu, Yanyan Peng, Zhiyong Feng
Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking (MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Title: Performance Analysis of Zero-Forcing Beamforming Strategies for the Uplink of an MU-MIMO System with Multi-Antenna Users
Authors: João Paulo P. G. Marques, Catherine Rosenberg
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the uplink of OFDMA-based MU-MIMO systems with multi-antenna users, for three Zero-Forcing (ZF) Beamforming (BF) strategies: Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-1 (CTR1), where only the strongest data stream is enabled per scheduled user; Block Diagonalization (BD), where all possible streams are enabled per scheduled user; Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-Flexible (CTRF), which allows a flexible stream allocation per user. The Radio Resource Management (RRM) of the uplink of all OFDMA-based systems must be done over an entire Time-Slot (TS) due to power management, making it challenging. To enable this study, we propose an efficient heuristic based on greedy-up searches for stream-sets that provides feasible solutions. It operates over the TS and considers fairness, practical Modulation and Coding Schemes and all RRM processes. The results show that, for Rural Macro scenarios, BD (resp. CTR1) could replace the more complex CTRF if the number of users is small (resp. large), while for Urban Macro scenarios, CTR1 emerges as an alternative to CTRF due to its similar performance. We also show that the system parameters can substantially impact the performance of the ZF strategies and that BD performance is more impaired with a simpler power management scheme than CTR1 and CTRF.

Title: Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Runyu Zhang, Na Li, Asuman Ozdaglar, Jeff Shamma, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.

Title: Zeroth-Order Constrained Optimization from a Control Perspective via Feedback Linearization
Authors: Runyu Zhang, Gioele Zardini, Asuman Ozdaglar, Jeff Shamma, Na Li
Abstract: Designing safe derivative-free optimization algorithms under unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge in modern learning and control. Most existing zeroth-order (ZO) approaches typically assume white-box constraints or focus on convex settings, leaving the general case of nonconvex optimization with black-box constraints largely open. We propose a control-theoretic framework for ZO constrained optimization that enforces feasibility without relying on solving costly convex subproblems. Leveraging feedback linearization, we introduce a family of ZO feedback linearization (ZOFL) algorithms applicable to both equality and inequality constraints. Our method requires only noisy, sample-based gradient estimates yet provably guarantees constraint satisfaction under mild regularity conditions. We establish finite-time bounds on constraint violation and further present a midpoint discretization variant that further improves feasibility without sacrificing optimality. Empirical results demonstrate that ZOFL consistently outperforms standard ZO baselines, achieving competitive objective values while maintaining feasibility.

Title: PEARL: Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM
Authors: Ju-Hyung Lee, Yanqing Lu, Klaus Doppler
Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Title: Learning Hybrid Dynamics via Convex Optimizations
Authors: Kaito Iwasaki, Sangli Teng, Anthony Bloch, Maani Ghaffari
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of identifying state-dependent switching systems, a class of hybrid dynamical systems that combine multiple linear or nonlinear modes. We propose two broad classes of switching systems: switching linear systems (SLSs) and switching polynomial systems (SPSs). We first formulate the joint estimation of the mode dynamics and switching rules as a mixed integer program. To solve its inherent scalability issue, we develop a hierarchy of convex relaxations and establish a bound and conditions under which these relaxations are tight. Building on these results, we propose a bilevel convex optimization framework that alternates between mode assignment and dynamics estimation, and we recover switching boundaries using margin-based polynomial classifiers. Numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear oscillators demonstrate that the method accurately identifies mode dynamics and reconstructs switching surfaces from trajectory data. Our results provide a tractable optimization-based framework for switching system identification.

Title: Towards Tighter Convex Relaxation of Mixed-integer Programs: Leveraging Logic Network Flow for Task and Motion Planning
Authors: Xuan Lin, Jiming Ren, Yandong Luo, Weijun Xie, Ye Zhao
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework, named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing environmental conditions. The project website is at this https URL.

Title: Prediction-Powered Communication with Distortion Guarantees
Authors: Matteo Zecchin, Unnikrishnan Kunnath Ganesan, Giuseppe Durisi, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting, in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors, communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics, suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered compression methods.

Title: From Sound to Setting: AI-Based Equalizer Parameter Prediction for Piano Tone Replication
Authors: Song-Ze Yu
Abstract: This project presents an AI-based system for tone replication in music production, focusing on predicting EQ parameter settings directly from audio features. Unlike traditional audio-to-audio methods, our approach outputs interpretable parameter values (e.g., EQ band gains) that musicians can further adjust in their workflow. Using a dataset of piano recordings with systematically varied EQ settings, we evaluate both regression and neural network models. The neural network achieves a mean squared error of 0.0216 on multi-band tasks. The system enables practical, flexible, and automated tone matching for music producers and lays the foundation for extensions to more complex audio effects.

Title: A Data-Centric Perspective on the Influence of Image Data Quality in Machine Learning Models
Authors: Pei-Han Chen, Szu-Chi Chung
Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development, with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited. This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset, we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training. Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in image-based machine learning.

Title: Energy-Efficient Movable Antennas: Mechanical Power Modeling and Performance Optimization
Authors: Xin Wei, Weidong Mei, Xuan Huang, Zhi Chen, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs' positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks

Title: Beyond Genre: Diagnosing Bias in Music Embeddings Using Concept Activation Vectors
Authors: Roman B. Gebhardt, Arne Kuhle, Eylül Bektur
Abstract: Music representation models are widely used for tasks such as tagging, retrieval, and music understanding. Yet, their potential to encode cultural bias remains underexplored. In this paper, we apply Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to investigate whether non-musical singer attributes - such as gender and language - influence genre representations in unintended ways. We analyze four state-of-the-art models (MERT, Whisper, MuQ, MuQ-MuLan) using the STraDa dataset, carefully balancing training sets to control for genre confounds. Our results reveal significant model-specific biases, aligning with disparities reported in MIR and music sociology. Furthermore, we propose a post-hoc debiasing strategy using concept vector manipulation, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating these biases. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware model design and show that conceptualized interpretability methods offer practical tools for diagnosing and mitigating representational bias in MIR.

Title: PhysiAgent: An Embodied Agent Framework in Physical World
Authors: Zhihao Wang, Jianxiong Li, Jinliang Zheng, Wencong Zhang, Dongxiu Liu, Yinan Zheng, Haoyi Niu, Junzhi Yu, Xianyuan Zhan
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid, sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

Title: CURA: Size Isnt All You Need - A Compact Universal Architecture for On-Device Intelligence
Authors: Jae-Bum Seo, Muhammad Salman, Lismer Andres Caceres-Najarro
Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains (e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches: (1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression, classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains. For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to 90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns, achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared error than competing models.

Title: HiKE: Hierarchical Evaluation Framework for Korean-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition
Authors: Gio Paik, Yongbeom Kim, Soungmin Lee, Sangmin Ahn, Chanwoo Kim
Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE will be available at this https URL.

Title: Stabilizing Humanoid Robot Trajectory Generation via Physics-Informed Learning and Control-Informed Steering
Authors: Evelyn D'Elia, Paolo Maria Viceconte, Lorenzo Rapetti, Diego Ferigo, Giulio Romualdi, Giuseppe L'Erario, Raffaello Camoriano, Daniele Pucci
Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

Title: Sparse Autoencoders Make Audio Foundation Models more Explainable
Authors: Théo Mariotte, Martin Lebourdais, Antonio Almudévar, Marie Tahon, Alfonso Ortega, Nicolas Dugué
Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems. Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes, establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors encoded in the representations.

Title: Physics-informed learning under mixing: How physical knowledge speeds up learning
Authors: Anna Scampicchio, Leonardo F. Toso, Rahel Rickenbach, James Anderson, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation due to data dependence.

Title: Enhanced Automatic Drum Transcription via Drum Stem Source Separation
Authors: Xavier Riley, Simon Dixon
Abstract: Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT) remains a challenging task in MIR but recent advances allow accurate transcription of drum kits with up 5 classes - kick, snare, hi-hats, toms and cymbals - via the ADTOF package. In addition, several drum kit \emph{stem} separation models in the open source community support separation for more than 6 stem classes, including distinct crash and ride cymbals. In this work we explore the benefits of combining these tools to improve the realism of drum transcriptions. We describe a simple post-processing step which expands the transcription output from five to seven classes and furthermore, we are able to estimate MIDI velocity values based on the separated stems. Our solution achieves strong performance when assessed against a baseline of 8-class drum transcription and produces realistic MIDI transcriptions suitable for MIR or music production tasks.

Title: DRCP: Diffusion on Reinforced Cooperative Perception for Perceiving Beyond Limits
Authors: Lantao Li, Kang Yang, Rui Song, Chen Sun
Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent, a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2) Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in late 2025.

Title: Experimental Study of Magnetic Near-Field Microstrip Electronic Probe for PCB EMC Emission Measurement
Authors: Hongchuan Jia, Fayu Wan (NUIST), Vladimir Mordachev, Jérôme Rossignol (ICB), Glauco Fontagalland, Nour Murad (PIMENT), Blaise Ravelo (NUIST)
Abstract: An experimental study on magnetic near-field (NF) scanning of printed circuit board (PCB) emission radiation is developed in this paper. The design and installation of the electromagnetic (EM) NF scanner is introduced. The test bed of magnetic NF emission in the microwave frequency range is described. The methodology of the microstrip magnetic NF probe is discussed. The probe calibration process was performed following the IEC 61967-1 NF scanning standard. The NF scanner functioning is tested with passive microstrip circuit square loop probe and device under test (DUT) PCB radiation in the test plan positioned at 1-mm above the ground plane. Based on the standard test with I-shape 50-$\Omega$ transmission line (TL), the calibration process of radiated magnetic field was validated by comparison between HFSS__ simulation and experimentation in very wideband frequency from 0.1-GHz to 3-GHz. Then, a nonstandard TL based DUT was experimented. Accordingly, the cartographies of scanned magnetic NF at two different test frequencies, 2 GHz and 3 GHz, are discussed. The NF scanner is under development for targeting the EMC radiated emission of PCB dedicated to operate in 6G wireless communication.

Title: Path Diffuser: Diffusion Model for Data-Driven Traffic Simulator
Authors: Da Saem Lee, Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant, Sebastian Fischmeister
Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be available for all agents on the this http URL which, generated scenarios often produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories. Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably, Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from adversarial benchmarks.

Title: MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management
Authors: Heming Fu, Guojun Xiong, Jian Li, Shan Lin
Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.

Title: Capacity Achieving Design for Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Rohollah Vahdani, S. Mohammad Razavizadeh
Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output (MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.

Title: Physics-Informed Inductive Biases for Voltage Prediction in Distribution Grids
Authors: Ehimare Okoyomon, Arbel Yaniv, Christoph Goebel
Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Title: Finite Beam Depth Analysis for Large Arrays
Authors: Alva Kosasih, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Most wireless communication systems operate in the far-field region of antennas and antenna arrays, where waves are planar and beams have infinite depth. When antenna arrays become electrically large, it is possible that the receiver is in the radiative near-field of the transmitter, and vice versa. Recent works have shown that near-field beamforming exhibits a finite depth, which enables a new depth-based spatial multiplexing paradigm. In this paper, we explore how the shape and size of an array determine the near-field beam behaviors. In particular, we investigate the $3$ dB beam depth (BD), defined as the range of distances where the gain is greater than half of the peak gain. We derive analytical gain and BD expressions and prove how they depend on the aperture area and length. For non-broadside transmissions, we find that the BD increases as the transmitter approaches the end-fire direction of the array. Furthermore, it is sufficient to characterize the BD for a broadside transmitter, as the beam pattern with a non-broadside transmitter can be approximated by that of a smaller/projected array with a broadside transmitter. Our analysis demonstrates that the BD can be ordered from smallest to largest as ULA, circular, and square arrays.

Title: Few-shot Personalized Saliency Prediction Based on Interpersonal Gaze Patterns
Authors: Yuya Moroto, Keisuke Maeda, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama
Abstract: This study proposes a few-shot personalized saliency prediction method that leverages interpersonal gaze patterns. Unlike general saliency maps, personalized saliency maps (PSMs) capture individual visual attention and provide insights into individual visual preferences. However, predicting PSMs is challenging because of the complexity of gaze patterns and the difficulty of collecting extensive eye-tracking data from individuals. An effective strategy for predicting PSMs from limited data is the use of eye-tracking data from other persons. To efficiently handle the PSMs of other persons, this study focuses on the selection of images to acquire eye-tracking data and the preservation of the structural information of PSMs. In the proposed method, these images are selected such that they bring more diverse gaze patterns to persons, and structural information is preserved using tensor-based regression. The experimental results demonstrate that these two factors are beneficial for few-shot PSM prediction.

Title: Asymptotic Analysis of Synchronous Signal Processing
Authors: Marc Vilà-Insa, Jaume Riba
Abstract: This paper extends various theoretical results from stationary data processing to cyclostationary (CS) processes under a unified framework. We first derive their asymptotic eigenbasis, which provides a link between their Fourier and Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansions, through a unitary transformation dictated by the cyclic spectrum. By exploiting this connection and the optimalities offered by the KL representation, we study the asymptotic performance of smoothing, filtering and prediction of CS processes, without the need for deriving explicit implementations. We obtain minimum mean squared error expressions that depend on the cyclic spectrum and include classical limits based on the power spectral density as particular cases. We conclude this work by applying the results to a practical scenario, in order to quantify the achievable gains of synchronous signal processing.

Title: CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control
Authors: Michael Eichelbeck, Hannah Markgraf, Matthias Althoff
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.

Title: Attentive Dilated Convolution for Automatic Sleep Staging using Force-directed Layout
Authors: Md Jobayer, Md Mehedi Hasan Shawon, Tasfin Mahmud, Md. Borhan Uddin Antor, Arshad M. Chowdhury
Abstract: Sleep stages play an important role in identifying sleep patterns and diagnosing sleep disorders. In this study, we present an automated sleep stage classifier called the Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (AttDiCNN), which uses deep learning methodologies to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and reliable and automatic sleep staging. We employed a force-directed layout based on the visibility graph to capture the most significant information from the EEG signals, thereby representing the spatial-temporal features. The proposed network consists of three modules: the Localized Spatial Feature Extraction Network (LSFE), Spatio-Temporal-Temporal Long Retention Network (S2TLR), and Global Averaging Attention Network (G2A). The LSFE captures spatial information from sleep data, the S2TLR is designed to extract the most pertinent information in long-term contexts, and the G2A reduces computational overhead by aggregating information from the LSFE and S2TLR. We evaluated the performance of our model on three comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.56%, 99.66%, and 99.08% for the EDFX, HMC, and NCH datasets, respectively, while maintaining a low computational complexity with 1.4 M parameters. Our proposed architecture surpasses existing methodologies in several performance metrics, thereby proving its potential as an automated tool for clinical settings.

Title: Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks
Authors: Paul M.J. Van den Hof, Shengling Shi, Stefanie J.M. Fonken, Karthik R. Ramaswamy, Håkan Hjalmarsson, Arne G. Dankers
Abstract: When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.

Title: Exploring the Impact of HAPS-RIS on UAV-Based Networks: a Novel Network Architecture
Authors: Arman Azizi, Mustafa A. Kishk, Arman Farhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a network architecture where two types of aerial infrastructures together with a ground station provide connectivity to a remote area. A high altitude platform station (HAPS) is equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, to be exploited to assist the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks. A key challenge in such networks is the restricted number of UAVs, which limits full coverage and leaves some users unsupported. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical bilevel optimization framework including a leader and a follower problem. The users served by HAPS-RIS are in a zone called HAPS-RIS zone and the users served by the UAVs are in another zone called UAV zone. In the leader problem, the goal is to establish the zone boundary and practical RIS phase shift design that maximizes the number of users covered by HAPS-RIS while ensuring that users in this zone meet their rate requirements. This is achieved through our proposed relaxation method and algorithm based on the RIS clustering concept. The follower problem focuses on minimizing the number of UAVs required, ensuring that the rate requirements of the users in the UAV zone are met. This is addressed through our proposed dynamic method adopting k-means clustering technique with adaptive UAV selection. Our study reveals that increasing the number of RIS elements significantly decreases the number of required UAVs.

Title: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Network
Authors: Shahran Rahman Alve, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and deep learning are increasingly applied in the clinical domain, particularly for early and accurate disease detection using medical imaging and sound. Due to limited trained personnel, there is a growing demand for automated tools to support clinicians in managing rising patient loads. Respiratory diseases such as cancer and diabetes remain major global health concerns requiring timely diagnosis and intervention. Auscultation of lung sounds, combined with chest X-rays, is an established diagnostic method for respiratory illness. This study presents a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for the analysis of respiratory sound data to detect Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Acoustic features extracted with the Librosa library, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Mel-Spectrogram, Chroma, Chroma (Constant Q), and Chroma CENS, were used in training. The system also classifies disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Evaluation on the ICBHI database achieved 96% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation and 90% accuracy without cross-validation. The proposed network outperforms existing methods, demonstrating potential as a practical tool for clinical deployment.

Title: Freqformer: Frequency-Domain Transformer for 3-D Reconstruction and Quantification of Human Retinal Vasculature
Authors: Lingyun Wang, Bingjie Wang, Jay Chhablani, Jose Alain Sahel, Shaohua Pi
Abstract: Objective: To achieve accurate 3-D reconstruction and quantitative analysis of human retinal vasculature from a single optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) scan. Methods: We introduce Freqformer, a novel Transformer-based model featuring a dual-branch architecture that integrates a Transformer layer for capturing global spatial context with a complex-valued frequency-domain module designed for adaptive frequency enhancement. Freqformer was trained using single depth-plane OCTA images, utilizing volumetrically merged OCTA as the ground truth. Performance was evaluated quantitatively through 2-D and 3-D image quality metrics. 2-D networks and their 3-D counterparts were compared to assess the differences between enhancing volume slice by slice and enhancing it by 3-D patches. Furthermore, 3-D quantitative vascular metrics were conducted to quantify human retinal vasculature. Results: Freqformer substantially outperformed existing convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based methods, achieving superior image metrics. Importantly, the enhanced OCTA volumes show strong correlation with the merged volumes on vascular segment count, density, length, and flow index, further underscoring its reliability for quantitative vascular analysis. 3-D counterparts did not yield additional gains in image metrics or downstream 3-D vascular quantification but incurred nearly an order-of-magnitude longer inference time, supporting our 2-D slice-wise enhancement strategy. Additionally, Freqformer showed excellent generalization capability on larger field-of-view scans, surpassing the quality of conventional volumetric merging methods. Conclusion: Freqformer reliably generates high-definition 3-D retinal microvasculature from single-scan OCTA, enabling precise vascular quantification comparable to standard volumetric merging methods.

Title: Analysis of Hierarchical AoII over Unreliable Channels: A Stochastic Hybrid System Approach
Authors: Han Xu, Jiaqi Li, Jixiang Zhang, Tiecheng Song, Yinfei Xu
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHSs) analysis of traditional AoI to the AoII metric. Hierarchical ageing processes are adopted using the continuous AoII for the first time, where two different hierarchy schemes, i.e., a hybrid of linear ageing processes with different slopes and a hybrid of linear and quadratic ageing processes, are considered. We first modify the main result in \cite[Theorem 1]{yates_age_2020b} to provide a systematic way to analyze the continuous hierarchical AoII over unslotted real-time systems. The closed-form expressions of average hierarchical AoII are obtained based on our Theorem \ref{theorem1} in two typical scenarios with different channel conditions, i.e., an M/M/1/1 queue over noisy channels and two M/M/1/1 queues over collision channels. Moreover, we analyze the stability conditions for two scenarios given that the quadratic ageing process may lead to the absence of stationary solutions. Finally, we compare the average age performance between the classic AoI results and our AoII results in the M/M/1/1 queue, and the effects of different channel parameters on AoII are also evaluated.

Title: Cell-Free Beamforming Design for Physical Layer Multigroup Multicasting
Authors: Mahmoud Zaher, Emil Björnson, Marina Petrova
Abstract: In many wireless communication applications, it is desirable to transmit the same data to multiple user equipments (UEs). Physical layer multicasting presents an efficient transmission topology to exploit the beamforming capabilities at the transmitting nodes and broadcast nature of the wireless channel to satisfy the demand for the same content from several UEs. An advantage of multicasting is to avoid unnecessary co-channel interference between UEs requesting the same data. The difficulty is to find the suitable beamforming configuration that guarantees an acceptable minimum data rate, among the receiving UE group, to the multicast transmission. This paper addresses the max-min fair multigroup multicast optimization problem and proposes a novel iterative elimination procedure coupled with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to find the near-optimal rank-1 beamforming vectors in a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) network. The proposed optimization procedure significantly improves computational complexity and spectral efficiency compared to common methods that use SDR followed by some randomization procedure and the state-of-the-art difference-of-convex approximation algorithm. The importance of the proposed procedure is that it is applicable to any SDR problem where a low-rank solution is desirable. Further, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that achieves 87 % of the optimal rank-1 solution at orders-of-magnitude lower computational time.

Title: Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective
Authors: Arslan Ali Syed, Majid Rostami-Shahrbabaki, Klaus Bogenberger
Abstract: Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 20% and a 40% HDVs nearly halves it, up until 100% HDVs where it drops by nearly 60%. The study also develops an adaptive potential line (APL) controller that forms APL corridors in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of nearly 10% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs is required to start observing the major LFT benefits. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.

Title: UNIR-Net: A Novel Approach for Restoring Underwater Images with Non-Uniform Illumination Using Synthetic Data
Authors: Ezequiel Perez-Zarate, Chunxiao Liu, Oscar Ramos-Soto, Diego Oliva, Marco Perez-Cisneros
Abstract: Restoring underwater images affected by non-uniform illumination (NUI) is essential to improve visual quality and usability in marine applications. Conventional methods often fall short in handling complex illumination patterns, while learning-based approaches face challenges due to the lack of targeted datasets. To address these limitations, the Underwater Non-uniform Illumination Restoration Network (UNIR-Net) is proposed. UNIR-Net integrates multiple components, including illumination enhancement, attention mechanisms, visual refinement, and contrast correction, to effectively restore underwater images affected by NUI. In addition, the Paired Underwater Non-uniform Illumination (PUNI) dataset is introduced, specifically designed for training and evaluating models under NUI conditions. Experimental results on PUNI and the large-scale real-world Non-Uniform Illumination Dataset (NUID) show that UNIR-Net achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual outcomes. UNIR-Net also improves downstream tasks such as underwater semantic segmentation, highlighting its practical relevance. The code of this method is available at this https URL

Title: FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities
Authors: Mingyuan Li, Jiahao Wang, Bo Du, Jun Shen, Qiang Wu
Abstract: Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise. The code and deployment video are available at the URL1

Title: Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model
Authors: Hang Yin, Li Qiao, Yu Ma, Shuo Sun, Kan Li, Zhen Gao, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR > 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.

Title: Structure-Aware Matrix Pencil Method
Authors: Yehonatan-Itay Segman, Alon Amar, Ronen Talmon
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting the number of complex exponentials and estimating their parameters from a noisy signal using the Matrix Pencil (MP) method. We introduce the MP modes and present their informative spectral structure. We show theoretically that these modes can be divided into signal and noise modes, where the signal modes exhibit a perturbed Vandermonde structure. Leveraging this structure, we propose a new MP algorithm, termed the SAMP algorithm, which has two novel components: (i) a robust, theoretically grounded model-order detection method, and (ii) an efficient estimation of the signal amplitudes. We show empirically that SAMP significantly outperforms the standard MP method in challenging conditions, with closely-spaced frequencies and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values, approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for a broad SNR range. Additionally, compared with prevalent information-based criteria, we show that SAMP achieves comparable or better results with lower computational time, and lower sensitivity to noise model mismatch.

Title: A Model-Free Terminal Iterative Learning Control Scheme for Multi-Layer Printing Alignment Control Problems
Authors: Zifeng Wang, Xiaoning Jin
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) printing technologies are promising for high-volume continuous production of substrate-based electronic products. One of the major challenges in R2R flexible electronics printing is achieving tight alignment tolerances, as specified by the device resolution (usually at the micro-meter level), for multi-layer printed electronics. The alignment of the printed patterns in different layers is known as registration. Conventional registration control methods rely on real-time feedback controllers, such as PID control, to regulate the web tension and the web speed. However, those methods may lose effectiveness in compensating for recurring disturbances and supporting effective mitigation of registration errors. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning Control (STILC) method integrated with PID control to iteratively learn and reduce registration error cycle-by-cycle, converging it to zero. This approach enables unprecedented precision in the creation, integration, and manipulation of multi-layer microstructures in R2R processes. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed STILC-PID hybrid approach and validate its effectiveness through a simulated registration error scenario caused by axis mismatch between roller and motor, a common issue in R2R systems. The results demonstrate that the STILC-PID hybrid control method can fully eliminate the registration error after a feasible number of iterations. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different learning gains on the convergence performance of STILC.

Title: Reconstruct Anything Model: a lightweight foundation model for computational imaging
Authors: Matthieu Terris, Samuel Hurault, Maxime Song, Julian Tachella
Abstract: Most existing learning-based methods for solving imaging inverse problems can be roughly divided into two classes: iterative algorithms, such as plug-and-play and diffusion methods leveraging pretrained denoisers, and unrolled architectures that are trained end-to-end for specific imaging problems. Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often yield suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally problem-specific and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems, such as deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution, and handles arbitrary image sizes and channels, such as grayscale, complex, and color data. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Lightweight Learning for Grant-Free Activity Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Ali Elkeshawy, Haifa Fares, Amor Nafkha
Abstract: Grant-free random access (GF-RA) is a promising access technique for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in future wireless networks, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond (6G) systems. Within the context of GF-RA, this study investigates the efficiency of employing supervised machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges on the device activity detection (AD). GF-RA addresses scalability by employing non-orthogonal pilot sequences, which provides an efficient alternative comparing to conventional grant-based random access (GB-RA) technique that are constrained by the scarcity of orthogonal preamble resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight data-driven algorithmic framework specifically designed for activity detection in GF-RA for mMTC in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. We propose two distinct framework deployment strategies, centralized and decentralized, both tailored to streamline the proposed approach implementation across network infrastructures. Moreover, we introduce optimized post-detection methodologies complemented by a clustering stage to enhance overall detection performances. Our 3GPP-compliant simulations have validated that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art model-based activity detection accuracy while significantly reducing complexity. Achieving 99% accuracy, it demonstrates real-world viability and effectiveness.

Title: Safety-Critical Control with Guaranteed Lipschitz Continuity via Filtered Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input is essential for practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints, but also raise concerns about the smoothness of the resulting control inputs. While smoothness typically refers to continuity and differentiability, it does not by itself ensure bounded input variation. In contrast, Lipschitz continuity is a stronger form of continuity that not only is necessary for the theoretical guarantee of safety, but also bounds the rate of variation and eliminates abrupt changes in the control input. Such abrupt changes can degrade system performance or even violate actuator limitations, yet current CBF-based methods do not provide Lipschitz continuity guarantees. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), which extend HOCBFs by incorporating an auxiliary dynamic system-referred to as an input regularization filter-to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and Lipschitz continuity of the control inputs simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.

Title: A Hybrid Systems Model of Feedback Optimization for Linear Systems: Convergence and Robustness
Authors: Oscar Jed Chuy, Matthew Hale, Ricardo Sanfelice
Abstract: Feedback optimization algorithms compute inputs to a system using real-time output measurements, which helps mitigate the effects of disturbances. However, existing work often models both system dynamics and computations in either discrete or continuous time, which may not accurately model some applications. In this work, we model linear system dynamics in continuous time, and we model the computations of inputs in discrete time. Therefore, we present a novel hybrid systems model of feedback optimization. We first establish the well-posedness of this hybrid model and establish completeness of solutions while ruling out Zeno behavior. Then we show the state of the system converges exponentially fast to a ball of known radius about a desired goal state. Next we analytically show that this system is robust to perturbations in (i) the values of measured outputs, (ii) the matrices that model the linear time-invariant system, and (iii) the times at which inputs are applied to the system. Simulation results confirm that this approach successfully mitigates the effects of disturbances.

Title: Frequency-Domain Bounds for the Multiconductor Telegrapher's Equation
Authors: Daniel Selvaratnam, Alessio Moreschini, Amritam Das, Thomas Parisini, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: We establish mathematical bounds on the chain, ABCD and immittance matrices of a multiconductor transmission line, based on the Telegrapher's equation. Closed-form expressions for those matrices are also presented. Existing results that hold on the imaginary axis are extended to the complex plane, without reliance on a diagonalizability assumption that is prevalent in the literature. Therefore, the results remain valid under arbitrary arrangements of the conducting wires, which include electrical faults. The analysis ultimately reveals important system-theoretic implications of the Telegrapher's equation, which are of general relevance to control, power systems, and signal processing involving multiconductor transmission lines.

Title: Steering the Herd: A Framework for LLM-based Control of Social Learning
Authors: Raghu Arghal, Kevin He, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti, Saswati Sarkar
Abstract: Algorithms increasingly serve as information mediators--from social media feeds and targeted advertising to the increasing ubiquity of LLMs. This engenders a joint process where agents combine private, algorithmically-mediated signals with learning from peers to arrive at decisions. To study such settings, we introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which an information-mediating planner (e.g. an LLM) controls the information structure of agents while they also learn from the decisions of earlier agents. The planner may seek to improve social welfare (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates. We prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from induced agent choices. Notably, in some regimes the biased planner intentionally obfuscates the agents' signals. Even under stringent transparency constraints--information parity with individuals, no lying or cherry-picking, and full observability--we show that information mediation can substantially shift social welfare in either direction. We complement our theory with simulations in which LLMs act as both planner and agents. Notably, the LLM planner in our simulations exhibits emergent strategic behavior in steering public opinion that broadly mirrors the trends predicted, though key deviations suggest the influence of non-Bayesian reasoning consistent with the cognitive patterns of both humans and LLMs trained on human-like data. Together, we establish our framework as a tractable basis for studying the impact and regulation of LLM information mediators.

Title: Collection: UAV-Based RSS Measurements from the AFAR Challenge in Digital Twin and Real-World Environments

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive real-world and Digital Twin (DT) dataset collected as part of the AERPAW Find A Rover (AFAR) Challenge, organized by the NSF Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) testbed and hosted at the Lake Wheeler Field in Raleigh, North Carolina. The AFAR Challenge was a competition involving five finalist university teams, focused on promoting innovation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF) source localization. Participating teams were tasked with designing UAV flight trajectories and localization algorithms to detect the position of a hidden unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), also referred to as a rover, emitting probe signals generated by GNU Radio. The competition was structured to evaluate solutions in a DT environment first, followed by deployment and testing in the AERPAW outdoor wireless testbed. For each team, the UGV was placed at three different positions, resulting in a total of 29 datasets, 15 collected in a DT simulation environment and 14 in a physical outdoor testbed. Each dataset contains time-synchronized measurements of received signal strength (RSS), received signal quality (RSQ), GPS coordinates, UAV velocity, and UAV orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw). Data is organized into structured folders by team, environment (DT and real-world), and UGV location. The dataset supports research in UAV-assisted RF source localization, air-to-ground (A2G) wireless propagation modeling, trajectory optimization, signal prediction, autonomous navigation, and DT validation. With 300k time-synchronized samples from the real-world experiments, the AFAR dataset enables effective training/testing of deep learning (DL) models and supports robust, real-world UAV-based wireless communication and sensing research.

Title: When Near Becomes Far: From Rayleigh to Optimal Near-Field and Far-Field Boundaries
Authors: Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: The transition toward 6G is pushing wireless communication into a regime where the classical plane-wave assumption no longer holds. Millimeter-wave and sub-THz frequencies shrink wavelengths to millimeters, while meter-scale arrays featuring hundreds of antenna elements dramatically enlarge the aperture. Together, these trends collapse the classical Rayleigh far-field boundary from kilometers to mere single-digit meters. Consequently, most practical 6G indoor, vehicular, and industrial deployments will inherently operate within the radiating near-field, where reliance on the plane-wave approximation leads to severe array-gain losses, degraded localization accuracy, and excessive pilot overhead. This paper re-examines the fundamental question: \emph{``Where does the far-field truly begin?''} Rather than adopting purely geometric definitions, we introduce an application-oriented approach based on user-defined error budgets and a rigorous Fresnel-zone analysis that fully accounts for both amplitude and phase curvature. We propose three practical mismatch metrics: worst-case element mismatch, worst-case normalized mean square error, and spectral efficiency loss. For each metric, we derive a provably optimal transition distance--the minimal range beyond which mismatch permanently remains below a given tolerance--and provide closed-form solutions. Extensive numerical evaluations across diverse frequencies and antenna-array dimensions show that our proposed thresholds can exceed the Rayleigh distance by more than an order of magnitude. By transforming the near-field from a design nuisance into a precise, quantifiable tool, our results provide a clear roadmap for enabling reliable and resource-efficient near-field communications and sensing in emerging 6G systems.

Title: Fine-grained Contrastive Learning for ECG-Report Alignment with Waveform Enhancement
Authors: Haitao Li, Che Liu, Zhengyao Ding, Ziyi Liu, Wenqi Shao, Zhengxing Huang
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, existing ECG-Report contrastive learning methods focus on whole-ECG and report alignment, missing the link between local ECG features and individual report tags. In this paper, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which achieves fine-grained alignment between specific ECG segments and each tag in the report via tag-specific ECG representations. Furthermore, we found that nearly 55\% of ECG reports in the MIMIC-ECG training dataset lack detailed waveform features, which hinders fine-grained alignment. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training process that leverages large language models (LLMs) to recover these missing waveform features and validate the LLM outputs using a coarse model. Additionally, fine-grained alignment at the tag level, rather than at the report level, exacerbates the false negative problem, as different reports may share common tags. To mitigate this, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide the model in identifying and correcting false negatives. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP significantly improves fine-grained alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing. Meanwhile, the fine-grained reports we generate also enhance the performance of other methods.

Title: Wideband channel sensing with holographic interference surfaces
Authors: Jindiao Huang, Haifan Yin
Abstract: The Holographic Interference Surface (HIS) opens up a new prospect for building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture by performing Radio Frequency (RF) domain signal processing. In this paper, we establish a wideband channel sensing architecture for electromagnetic wave reception and channel estimation based on the principle of holographic interference theory. Dute to the nonlinear structure of holograms, interferential fringes composed of wideband RF signals exhibit severe self-interference effects in the time-frequency domain, which are inherently resistant to the classical signal processing tools. To overcome the self-interference, we propose a holographic channel recovery method, which analyzes the time-domain variation of holograms from a geometrical perspective and constructs an inverse mapping from wideband holograms to object waves. Based on the Wirtinger partial derivative and Armijo condition, we then develop a wideband hologram-based maximum likelihood (WH-ML) estimation method for estimating the channel state information (CSI) from holograms. We also propose a geometric rotation-based object wave sensing (GROWS) algorithm to address the complicated computation of ML estimation. Furthermore, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for investigating the achievable performance of wideband holographic channel estimation. Simulation results show that under the wideband channel sensing architecture, our proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the CSI in wideband scenarios.

Title: TADA: Training-free Attribution and Out-of-Domain Detection of Audio Deepfakes
Authors: Adriana Stan, David Combei, Dan Oneata, Horia Cucu
Abstract: Deepfake detection has gained significant attention across audio, text, and image modalities, with high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake. However, identifying the exact source--such as the system or model behind a deepfake--remains a less studied problem. In this paper, we take a significant step forward in audio deepfake model attribution or source tracing by proposing a training-free, green AI approach based entirely on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Leveraging a pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) model, we show that grouping samples from the same generator is straightforward--we obtain an 0.93 F1-score across five deepfake datasets. The method also demonstrates strong out-of-domain (OOD) detection, effectively identifying samples from unseen models at an F1-score of 0.84. We further analyse these results in a multi-dimensional approach and provide additional insights. All code and data protocols used in this work are available in our open repository: this https URL.

Title: Unmasking real-world audio deepfakes: A data-centric approach
Authors: David Combei, Adriana Stan, Dan Oneata, Nicolas Müller, Horia Cucu
Abstract: The growing prevalence of real-world deepfakes presents a critical challenge for existing detection systems, which are often evaluated on datasets collected just for scientific purposes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset of real-world audio deepfakes. Our analysis reveals that these real-world examples pose significant challenges, even for the most performant detection models. Rather than increasing model complexity or exhaustively search for a better alternative, in this work we focus on a data-centric paradigm, employing strategies like dataset curation, pruning, and augmentation to improve model robustness and generalization. Through these methods, we achieve a 55% relative reduction in EER on the In-the-Wild dataset, reaching an absolute EER of 1.7%, and a 63% reduction on our newly proposed real-world deepfakes dataset, AI4T. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-centric approaches in enhancing deepfake detection for real-world applications. Code and data available at: this https URL.

Title: RAM-W1K: A Multi-Task Wrist Dataset and Benchmark for Rheumatoid Arthritis
Authors: Songxiao Yang, Haolin Wang, Yao Fu, Ye Tian, Tamotsu Kamishima, Masayuki Ikebe, Yafei Ou, Masatoshi Okutomi
Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 1048 wrist conventional radiographs of 388 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 618 images and SvdH BE scores for 800 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.

Title: Constraint Hypergraphs as a Unifying Framework for Digital Twins
Authors: John Morris, Douglas L. Van Bossuyt, Edward Louis, Gregory Mocko, John Wagner
Abstract: Digital twins, used to represent physical systems, have been lauded as tools for understanding reality. Complex system behavior is typically captured in domain-specific models crafted by subject experts. Contemporary methods for employing models in a digital twin require prescriptive interfaces, resulting in twins that are difficult to connect, redeploy, and modify. The limited interoperability of these twins has prompted calls for a universal framework enabling observability across model aggregations. Here we show how a new mathematical formalism called a constraint hypergraph addresses these challenges in interoperability. A digital twin is shown to be the second of two coupled systems where both adhere to the same constraint hypergraph, permitting the properties of the first to be observable from the second. Interoperability is given by deconstructing models into a structure enabling autonomous, white-box simulation of system properties. The resulting digital twins can interact immediately with both human and autonomous agents. This is demonstrated in a case study of a microgrid, showing how both measured and simulated data from the aggregated twins can be provided regardless of the operating environment. By connecting models, constraint hypergraphs supply scientists and modelers robust means to capture, communicate, and combine digital twins across all fields of study. We expect this framework to expand the use of digital twins, enriching scientific insights and collaborations by providing a structure for characterizing complex systems.

Title: Liquid Intelligent Metasurface for Fluid Antennas-Assisted Networks
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel liquid intelligent metasurface (LIM)-assisted downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, wherein both the base station (BS) and the metasurface are respectively equipped with fluid antennas (FA) and liquid elements. Unlike conventional reconfigurable metasurface-assisted systems with static geometries, the proposed architecture enables joint electromagnetic and spatial reconfigurability by allowing both the FA-empowered BS (FAS) and LIM to dynamically adjust their small-scale positions in addition to beamforming and phase-shift controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, LIM phase-shifts, and the positions of fluid antennas and liquid elements. The problem is highly non-convex due to coupling between variables, fractional expressions, unit-modulus constraints as well as spatial correlation functions. To address these challenges, we adopt alternating optimization and introduce auxiliary variables and employ Lagrangian dual and quadratic transformation, successive convex approximation (SCA) as well as the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) to solve the respective subproblems. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed FAS-LIM architecture significantly outperforms benchmark methods employing conventional fixed metasurface and fixed antenna arrays in terms of various parameter settings.

Title: Joint Multi-Target Detection-Tracking in Cognitive Massive MIMO Radar via POMCP
Authors: Imad Bouhou, Stefano Fortunati, Leila Gharsalli, Alexandre Renaux
Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree, enabling scalable and efficient planning. Departing from uniform power allocation, which is often suboptimal with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), our approach predicts each target's future angular position and expected received power based on its expected range. These predictions guide adaptive waveform design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring sufficient power for high-SNR targets. Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive, efficient multi-target radar systems.

Title: Real-Time Doppler and Ionospheric Dispersion Correction Techniques for Arbitrary Waveforms Utilizing GPU Compute
Authors: Daniel J. Vickers, A. H. Mack, Idahosa A. Osaretin
Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems, real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion. Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

Title: Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic
Authors: Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.

Title: Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yizhe Zhang, Qiang Chen, Tao Zhou
Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

Title: Geometry-Aware Decentralized Sinkhorn for Wasserstein Barycenters
Authors: Ali Baheri, David Millard, Alireza Vahid
Abstract: Distributed systems require fusing heterogeneous local probability distributions into a global summary over sparse and unreliable communication networks. Traditional consensus algorithms, which average distributions in Euclidean space, ignore their inherent geometric structure, leading to misleading results. Wasserstein barycenters offer a geometry-aware alternative by minimizing optimal transport costs, but their entropic approximations via the Sinkhorn algorithm typically require centralized coordination. This paper proposes a fully decentralized Sinkhorn algorithm that reformulates the centralized geometric mean as an arithmetic average in the log-domain, enabling approximation through local gossip protocols. Agents exchange log-messages with neighbors, interleaving consensus phases with local updates to mimic centralized iterations without a coordinator. To optimize bandwidth, we integrate event-triggered transmissions and b-bit quantization, providing tunable trade-offs between accuracy and communication while accommodating asynchrony and packet loss. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence to a neighborhood of the centralized entropic barycenter, with bias linearly dependent on consensus tolerance, trigger threshold, and quantization error. Complexity scales near-linearly with network size. Simulations confirm near-centralized accuracy with significantly fewer messages, across various topologies and conditions.

Title: SynParaSpeech: Automated Synthesis of Paralinguistic Datasets for Speech Generation and Understanding
Authors: Bingsong Bai, Qihang Lu, Wenbing Yang, Zihan Sun, Yueran Hou, Peilei Jia, Songbai Pu, Ruibo Fu, Yingming Gao, Ya Li, Jun Gao
Abstract: Paralinguistic sounds, like laughter and sighs, are crucial for synthesizing more realistic and engaging speech. However, existing methods typically depend on proprietary datasets, while publicly available resources often suffer from incomplete speech, inaccurate or missing timestamps, and limited real-world relevance. To address these problems, we propose an automated framework for generating large-scale paralinguistic data and apply it to construct the SynParaSpeech dataset. The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with 118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving paralinguistic event detection. The dataset and audio samples are available at this https URL.

Title: Generalized Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architectures: Theory and Design via Structure-oriented Symmetric Unitary Projection
Authors: Xiaohua Zhou, Tianyu Fang, Yijie Mao, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead), and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high efficiency.

Title: Frequency-Aware Ensemble Learning for BraTS 2025 Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Yuxiao Yi, Qingyao Zhuang, Zhi-Qin John Xu
Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge. Our method incorporates three key extensions: adjustable initialization scales for optimal nnU-Net complexity control, transfer learning from BraTS 2021 pre-trained models to enhance Swin UNETR's generalization on pediatric dataset, and frequency domain decomposition for HFF-Net to separate low-frequency tissue contours from high-frequency texture details. Our final ensemble combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 72.3% (ET), 95.6% (NET), 68.9% (CC), 89.5% (ED), 92.3% (TC), and 92.3% (WT), respectively.

Title: Impact of RHIs and ipSIC on Active RIS-NOMA Systems with Low-Precision ADCs
Authors: Qianqian Li, Hua Li, Shiya Hao, Lintao Li, Xiaoming Dai
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.

Title: Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-RIS): Scattering Matrix Design via Manifold Optimization
Authors: Marko Fidanovski, Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Emil Björnson
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.

Title: Fractional Logistic Growth with Memory Effects: A Tool for Industry-Oriented Modeling
Authors: M.O. Aibinu, A. Shoukat, F.M. Mahomed
Abstract: The logistic growth model is a classical framework for describing constrained growth phenomena, widely applied in areas such as population dynamics, epidemiology, and resource management. This study presents a generalized extension using Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense (ABC)-type fractional derivatives. Proportional time delay is also included, allowing the model to capture memory-dependent and nonlocal dynamics not addressed in classical formulations. Free parameters provide flexibility for modeling complex growth in industrial, medical, and social systems. The Hybrid Sumudu Variational (HSV) method is employed to efficiently obtain semi-analytical solutions. Results highlight the combined effects of fractional order and delay on system behavior. This approach demonstrates the novelty of integrating ABC-type derivatives, proportional delay, and HSV-based solutions for real-world applications.

Title: A Crime/S.I.R. optimal control problem
Authors: Mariana Álvarez, Alexander Alegría, Andrés Rivera, Sebastián Pedersen
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses a mathematical model inspired by control theory to derive optimal public policies for minimizing costs associated with the reduction and control of criminal activity in a population. Specifically, we analyze the optimal control problem \begin{equation*} \min G(u_1, u_2, u_3) = \int_{0}^{t_{\text{F}}} \left( I(t) - R(t) + \frac{B_1}{2} u_1^2(t) + \frac{B_2}{2} u_2^2(t) + \frac{B_3}{2} u_3^2(t) \right) \, dt. \end{equation*} where $I=I(t)$ and $R=R(t)$ satisfies the system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} \dot{S} &= \Lambda - (1-u_1)SI - \mu S + ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + \rho \Omega R,\\ \dot{I} &= (1-u_1)SI - (\mu + \delta_1)I - ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + (1-\Omega)\rho R,\\ \dot{R} &= ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - (\mu + \delta_2 + \rho)R. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} Our approach assumes that the social and economic effects of criminal behavior can be modeled by a dynamic SIR-type system, which serves as a constraint on a cost functional associated with the strategies implemented by government and law enforcement authorities to reduce criminal behavior. Using optimal control theory, the proposed controls, i.e., preventive policies (such as community and social cohesion programs), are expected to have a significant and positive impact on crime reduction, generating opportunities for the most disadvantaged sectors of Cali society and contributing to long-term security. Given that resources to address this problem are limited, this research aims to determine an optimal combination of public interventions and policies that minimize criminality at the lowest possible economic cost, using an SIR model, tools from variational calculus, and optimal control theory.

Title: Theoretical Performance Limit for Radar Parameter Estimation
Authors: Dazhuan Xu, Han Zhang, Nan Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the thoughts and methodologies of Shannon's information theory to solve the problem of the optimal radar parameter estimation. Based on a general radar system model, the \textit{a posteriori} probability density function of targets' parameters is derived. Range information (RI) and entropy error (EE) are defined to evaluate the performance. It is proved that acquiring 1 bit of the range information is equivalent to reducing estimation deviation by half. The closed-form approximation for the EE is deduced in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, which demonstrates that the EE degenerates to the mean square error (MSE) when the SNR is tending to infinity. Parameter estimation theorem is then proved, which claims that the theoretical RI is achievable. The converse claims that there exists no unbiased estimator whose empirical RI is larger than the theoretical RI. Simulation result demonstrates that the theoretical EE is tighter than the commonly used Cramér-Rao bound and the ZivZakai bound.

Title: Vibrational Stabilization of Complex Network Systems
Authors: Alberto Maria Nobili, Yuzhen Qin, Carlo Alberto Avizzano, Danielle S. Bassett, Fabio Pasqualetti
Abstract: Many natural and man-made network systems need to maintain certain patterns, such as working at equilibria or limit cycles, to function properly. Thus, the ability to stabilize such patterns is crucial. Most of the existing studies on stabilization assume that network systems states can be measured online so that feedback control strategies can be used. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems states, e.g., neuronal activity in the brain, are often difficult to measure. In this paper, we take this situation into account and study the stabilization problem of linear network systems with an open-loop control strategy (vibrational control). We derive a graph-theoretic sufficient condition for structural vibrational stabilizability, under which network systems can always be stabilized. We further provide an approach to select the locations in the network for control placement and design corresponding vibrational inputs to stabilize systems that satisfy this condition. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings.

Title: Second-Order Algorithms for Finding Local Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games
Authors: Kushagra Gupta, Xinjie Liu, Ross Allen, Ufuk Topcu, David Fridovich-Keil
Abstract: Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with an asymptotic local \textit{linear} convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local \textit{superlinear} convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods with similar guarantees do not offer convergence rates in the nonconvex-nonconcave setting. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.

Title: M6(GPT)3: Generating Multitrack Modifiable Multi-Minute MIDI Music from Text using Genetic algorithms, Probabilistic methods and GPT Models in any Progression and Time Signature
Authors: Jakub Poćwiardowski, Mateusz Modrzejewski, Marek S. Tatara
Abstract: This work introduces the M6(GPT)3 composer system, capable of generating complete, multi-minute musical compositions with complex structures in any time signature, in the MIDI domain from input descriptions in natural language. The system utilizes an autoregressive transformer language model to map natural language prompts to composition parameters in JSON format. The defined structure includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody, bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. We propose a genetic algorithm for the generation of melodic elements. The algorithm incorporates mutations with musical significance and a fitness function based on normal distribution and predefined musical feature values. The values adaptively evolve, influenced by emotional parameters and distinct playing styles. The system for generating percussion in any time signature utilises probabilistic methods, including Markov chains. Through both human and objective evaluations, we demonstrate that our music generation approach outperforms baselines on specific, musically meaningful metrics, offering a viable alternative to purely neural network-based systems.

Title: DM-Codec: Distilling Multimodal Representations for Speech Tokenization
Authors: Md Mubtasim Ahasan, Md Fahim, Tasnim Mohiuddin, A K M Mahbubur Rahman, Aman Chadha, Tariq Iqbal, M Ashraful Amin, Md Mofijul Islam, Amin Ahsan Ali
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant improvements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

Title: Is FISHER All You Need in The Multi-AUV Underwater Target Tracking Task?
Authors: Guanwen Xie, Jingzehua Xu, Ziqi Zhang, Xiangwang Hou, Dongfang Ma, Shuai Zhang, Yong Ren, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: It is significant to employ multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.

Title: Training-Free Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Mahdi Saberi, Chi Zhang, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency, we devise a novel mitigation objective that is minimized in a small ball around the attack input. Results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. We also introduce a practically relevant scenario for small adversarial perturbations that models impulse noise in raw data, which relates to \emph{herringbone artifacts}, and show the applicability of our approach in this setting. Finally, we show our mitigation approach remains effective in two \emph{realistic} extension scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy.

Title: Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis
Authors: Siddharth Chandak
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.

Title: LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection
Authors: Yihe Wang, Nan Huang, Nadia Mammone, Marco Cecchi, Xiang Zhang
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: this https URL

Title: Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters
Authors: Simon Donker van Heel, Rutger-Jan Lange, Bram van Os, Dick van Dijk
Abstract: Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.

Title: GCDance: Genre-Controlled Music-Driven 3D Full Body Dance Generation
Authors: Xinran Liu, Xu Dong, Shenbin Qian, Diptesh Kanojia, Wenwu Wang, Zhenhua Feng
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization
Authors: Harish K. Dureppagari, R. Michael Buehrer, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.

Title: Rapidly Converging Time-Discounted Ergodicity on Graphs for Active Inspection of Confined Spaces
Authors: Benjamin Wong, Ryan H. Lee, Tyler M. Paine, Santosh Devasia, Ashis G. Banerjee
Abstract: Ergodic exploration has spawned a lot of interest in mobile robotics due to its ability to design time trajectories that match desired spatial coverage statistics. However, current ergodic approaches are for continuous spaces, which require detailed sensory information at each point and can lead to fractal-like trajectories that cannot be tracked easily. This paper presents a new ergodic approach for graph-based discretization of continuous spaces. It also introduces a new time-discounted ergodicity metric, wherein early visitations of information-rich nodes are weighted more than late visitations. A Markov chain synthesized using a convex program is shown to converge more rapidly to time-discounted ergodicity than the traditional fastest mixing Markov chain. The resultant ergodic traversal method is used within a hierarchical framework for active inspection of confined spaces with the goal of detecting anomalies robustly using SLAM-driven Bayesian hypothesis testing. Experiments on a ground robot show the advantages of this framework over three continuous space ergodic planners as well as greedy and random exploration methods for left-behind foreign object debris detection in a ballast tank.

Title: Finite-Time Bounds for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation with Arbitrary Norm Contractions and Markovian Noise
Authors: Siddharth Chandak, Shaan Ul Haque, Nicholas Bambos
Abstract: Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm with applications in reinforcement learning and optimization. Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.

Title: Certified Neural Approximations of Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Frederik Baymler Mathiesen, Nikolaus Vertovec, Francesco Fabiano, Luca Laurenti, Alessandro Abate
Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that our framework can successfully address additional scenarios previously intractable for existing methods - neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators for the purpose of trajectory prediction.

Title: EnvSDD: Benchmarking Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection
Authors: Han Yin, Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das, Jisheng Bai, Haohe Liu, Wenwu Wang, Mark D Plumbley
Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.

Title: GRAM: Spatial general-purpose audio representation models for real-world applications
Authors: Goksenin Yuksel, Marcel van Gerven, Kiki van der Heijden
Abstract: Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.

Title: Beyond Classification: Towards Speech Emotion Reasoning with Multitask AudioLLMs
Authors: Wenyu Zhang, Yingxu He, Geyu Lin, Zhuohan Liu, Shuo Sun, Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Jeremy H. M. Wong, Qiongqiong Wang, Hardik B. Sailor, Nancy F. Chen, Ai Ti Aw
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned, evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and evidential grounding of the generated responses. Experiments on two out-of-domain datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the resulting model.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks. They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

Title: IML-Spikeformer: Input-aware Multi-Level Spiking Transformer for Speech Processing
Authors: Zeyang Song, Shimin Zhang, Yuhong Chou, Jibin Wu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms, represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve competitive performance on large-scale speech processing tasks. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS) mechanism, which simulates multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further integrates a Re-parameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$ respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy efficiency.

Title: Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots
Authors: Riccardo Bussola, Michele Focchi, Giulio Turrisi, Claudio Semini, Luigi Palopoli
Abstract: Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining Bézier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.

Title: 802.11bf Multiband Passive Sensing: Reusing Wi-Fi Signaling for Sensing
Authors: Pablo Picazo-Martinez, Carlos Barroso-Fernández, Alejandro Calvillo-Fernandez, Milan Groshev, Carlos J. Bernardos, Antonio de la Oliva, Alain Mourad
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.

Title: Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models
Authors: Brennen A. Hill, Mant Koh En Wei, Thangavel Jishnuanandh
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Title: Optimality of Linear Policies in Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control
Authors: Bahar Taşkesen, Dan A. Iancu, Çağıl Koçyiğit, Daniel Kuhn
Abstract: We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian. When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.

Title: ECHO: Frequency-aware Hierarchical Encoding for Variable-length Signals
Authors: Yucong Zhang, Juan Liu, Ming Li
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in audio, vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling with arbitrary sampling rates-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on this https URL.

Title: BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories
Authors: Yifan Li, Javad Sohankar, Ji Luo, Jing Li, Yi Su
Abstract: Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.

Title: T-MLP: Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron for Level-of-Detail Signal Representation
Authors: Chuanxiang Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Guangshun Wei, Siyu Ren, Yuan Liu, Junhui Hou, Wenping Wang
Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we propose a novel network architecture that enables LoD signal representation. Our approach builds on a modified Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and thus lacks native LoD support. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP), which extends the MLP by attaching an output branch, also called tail, to each hidden layer. Each tail refines the residual between the current prediction and the ground-truth signal, so that the accumulated outputs across layers correspond to the target signals at different LoDs, enabling multi-scale modeling with supervision from only a single-resolution signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T-MLP outperforms existing neural LoD baselines across diverse signal representation tasks.

Title: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Transformer Layers in Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper for Speaker Identification Tasks
Authors: Linus Stuhlmann, Michael Alexander Saxer
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of three advanced speech encoder models, Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper, in speaker identification tasks. By fine-tuning these models and analyzing their layer-wise representations using SVCCA, k-means clustering, and t-SNE visualizations, we found that Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R capture speaker-specific features effectively in their early layers, with fine-tuning improving stability and performance. Whisper showed better performance in deeper layers. Additionally, we determined the optimal number of transformer layers for each model when fine-tuned for speaker identification tasks.

Title: Xi+: Uncertainty Supervision for Robust Speaker Embedding
Authors: Junjie Li, Kong Aik Lee, Duc-Tuan Truong, Tianchi Liu, Man-Wai Mak
Abstract: There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.

Title: A Hybrid TDMA/CSMA Protocol for Time-Sensitive Traffic in Robot Applications
Authors: Shiqi Xu, Lihao Zhang, Yuyang Du, Qun Yang, Soung Chang Liew
Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control this http URL this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot this http URL protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.

Title: Feature Space Analysis by Guided Diffusion Model
Authors: Kimiaki Shirahama, Miki Yanobu, Kaduki Yamashita, Miho Ohsaki
Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various image attributes are encoded into the user-specified feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.

Title: TalkPlayData 2: An Agentic Synthetic Data Pipeline for Multimodal Conversational Music Recommendation
Authors: Keunwoo Choi, Seungheon Doh, Juhan Nam
Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation
Authors: Xin Xing, Irmak Karaca, Amir Akhavanrezayat, Samira Badrloo, Quan Dong Nguyen, Mahadevan Subramaniam
Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.

Title: Autonomous Close-Proximity Photovoltaic Panel Coating Using a Quadcopter
Authors: Dimitri Jacquemont, Carlo Bosio, Teaya Yang, Ruiqi Zhang, Ozgur Orun, Shuai Li, Reza Alam, Thomas M. Schutzius, Simo A. Makiharju, Mark W. Mueller
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects. Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.

Title: FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs
Authors: Md Mubtasim Ahasan, Rafat Hasan Khan, Tasnim Mohiuddin, Aman Chadha, Tariq Iqbal, M Ashraful Amin, Amin Ahsan Ali, Md Mofijul Islam, A K M Mahbubur Rahman
Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at this https URL.

Title: MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs
Authors: Feilong Chen, Yijiang Liu, Yi Huang, Hao Wang, Miren Tian, Ya-Qi Yu, Minghui Liao, Jihao Wu
Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.

Title: Sidon: Fast and Robust Open-Source Multilingual Speech Restoration for Large-scale Dataset Cleansing
Authors: Wataru Nakata, Yuki Saito, Yota Ueda, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.

Title: Subspace Clustering of Subspaces: Unifying Canonical Correlation Analysis and Subspace Clustering
Authors: Paris A. Karakasis, Nicholas D. Sidiropoulos
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.
