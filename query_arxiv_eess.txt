Title: New Algorithm for Structured OFDM Channel Estimation using Subgroup Duality
Authors: Demerson N. Gonçalves, João T. Dias
Abstract: This paper presents a group-theoretic framework for structured channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). By modeling subcarriers as the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_N\), we show that nulling a subgroup \(H \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N\) constrains the channel impulse response to its annihilator \(H^\perp\) in the dual domain. A low-complexity estimator is proposed that detects such structure by evaluating energy concentration across candidate annihilators. Simulations demonstrate consistent gains in mean squared error, bit error rate, and throughput compared with least-squares and linear minimum mean square error baselines, achieving competitive performance with substantially lower complexity and preserved interpretability.

Title: Kinematics Control of Electromagnetic Formation Flight Using Angular-Momentum Conservation Constraint
Authors: Yuta Takahashi, Hiraku Sakamoto, Shin-ichiro Sakai
Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.

Title: Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Scene Hyperspectral Imaging
Authors: Lu Huo, Haimin Zhang, Min Xu
Abstract: Knowledge transfer plays a crucial role in cross-scene hyperspectral imaging (HSI). However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving robust and balanced knowledge transfer across heterogeneous HSI scenes.

Title: Enhanced Chest Disease Classification Using an Improved CheXNet Framework with EfficientNetV2-M and Optimization-Driven Learning
Authors: Ali M. Bahram, Saman Muhammad Omer, Hardi M. Mohammed, Sirwan Abdolwahed Aula
Abstract: The interpretation of Chest X-ray is an important diagnostic issue in clinical practice and especially in the resource-limited setting where the shortage of radiologists plays a role in delayed diagnosis and poor patient outcomes. Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent. This framework presents itself as a decision-support tool that can be used to respond to a pandemic, screen tuberculosis, and assess thoracic disease regularly in various healthcare facilities.

Title: LG Uplus System with Multi-Speaker IDs and Discriminator-based Sub-Judges for the WildSpoof Challenge
Authors: Jinyoung Park, Won Jang, Jiwoong Park
Abstract: This paper describes our submission to the WildSpoof Challenge Track 2, which focuses on spoof-aware speaker verification (SASV) in the presence of high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) attacks. We adopt a ResNet-221 back-bone and study two speaker-labeling strategies, namelyDual-Speaker IDs and Multi-Speaker IDs, to explicitly enlarge the margin between bona fide and generated speech in the embedding space. In addition, we propose discriminator-based sub-judge systems that reuse internal features from HiFi-GAN and BigVGAN discriminators, aggregated via multi-query multi-head attentive statistics pooling(MQMHA). Experimental results on the SpoofCeleb corpus show that our system design is effective in improving agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF).

Title: Causal Attribution of Model Performance Gaps in Medical Imaging Under Distribution Shifts
Authors: Pedro M. Gordaliza, Nataliia Molchanova, Jaume Banus, Thomas Sanchez, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation suffer significant performance drops due to distribution shifts, but the causal mechanisms behind these drops remain poorly understood. We extend causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional segmentation tasks, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to performance degradation. We model the data-generating process through a causal graph and employ Shapley values to fairly attribute performance changes to individual mechanisms. Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\pm$ 9.1%). This mechanism-specific quantification enables practitioners to prioritize targeted interventions based on deployment context.

Title: Characterizing Human Feedback-Based Control in Naturalistic Driving Interactions via Gaussian Process Regression with Linear Feedback
Authors: Rachel DiPirro, Rosalyn Devonport, Dan Calderone, Chishang "Mario'' Yang, Wendy Ju, Meeko Oishi
Abstract: Understanding driver interactions is critical to designing autonomous vehicles to interoperate safely with human-driven cars. We consider the impact of these interactions on the policies drivers employ when navigating unsigned intersections in a driving simulator. The simulator allows the collection of naturalistic decision-making and behavior data in a controlled environment. Using these data, we model the human driver responses as state-based feedback controllers learned via Gaussian Process regression methods. We compute the feedback gain of the controller using a weighted combination of linear and nonlinear priors. We then analyze how the individual gains are reflected in driver behavior. We also assess differences in these controllers across populations of drivers. Our work in data-driven analyses of how drivers determine their policies can facilitate future work in the design of socially responsive autonomy for vehicles.

Title: A New Particle Filter for Target Tracking in MIMO OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Shixiong Wang, Wei Dai, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: Particle filtering for target tracking using multi-input multi-output (MIMO) pulse-Doppler radars faces three long-standing obstacles: a) the absence of reliable likelihood models for raw radar data; b) the computational and statistical complications that arise when nuisance parameters (e.g., complex path gains) are augmented into state vectors; and c) the prohibitive computational burden of extracting noisy measurements of range, Doppler, and angles from snapshots. Motivated by an optimization-centric interpretation of Bayes' rule, this article addresses these challenges by proposing a new particle filtering framework that evaluates each hypothesized state using a tailored cost function, rather than relying on an explicit likelihood relation. The framework yields substantial reductions in both running time and tracking error compared to existing schemes. In addition, we examine the implementation of the proposed particle filter in MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, aiming to equip modern communication infrastructure with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities. Experiments suggest that MIMO-OFDM with pulse-Doppler processing holds considerable promise for ISAC, particularly when wide bandwidth, extended on-target time, and large antenna aperture are utilized.

Title: A Hybrid Residue Floating Numerical Architecture for High Precision Arithmetic on FPGAs
Authors: Mostafa Darvishi
Abstract: Floating point arithmetic remains expensive on FPGA platforms due to wide datapaths and normalization logic, motivating alternative representations that preserve dynamic range at lower cost. This work introduces the Hybrid Residue Floating Numerical Architecture (HRFNA), a unified arithmetic system that combines carry free residue channels with a lightweight floating point scaling factor. We develop the full mathematical framework, derive bounded error normalization rules, and present FPGA optimized microarchitectures for modular multiplication, exponent management, and hybrid reconstruction. HRFNA is implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104, with Vitis simulation, RTL synthesis, and on chip ILA traces confirming cycle accurate correctness. The architecture achieves over 2.1 times throughput improvement and 38-52 percent LUT reduction compared to IEEE 754 single precision baselines while maintaining numerical stability across long iterative sequences. These results demonstrate that HRFNA offers an efficient and scalable alternative to floating point computation on modern FPGA devices.

Title: Secure Wireless Communication Using Distributed Coherent Transmission and Spatial Signal Decomposition
Authors: Anton Schlegel, Jason M/ Merlo, Samuel Wagner, John B. Lancaster, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We present a new approach to secure wireless communications using coherent distributed transmission of signals that are spatially decomposed between a two-element distributed antenna array. High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured.

Title: MPC for momentum counter-balanced and zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning satellite
Authors: Theofania Karampela, Rishie Seshadri, Florian Dörfler, Sarah H.Q. Li
Abstract: In on-orbit robotics, a servicer satellite's ability to make contact with a free-spinning target satellite is essential to completing most on-orbit servicing (OOS) tasks. This manuscript develops a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that generates feasible controls for a servicer satellite to achieve zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning target satellite. The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise.

Title: Human perception of audio deepfakes: the role of language and speaking style
Authors: Eugenia San Segundo, Aurora López-Jareño, Xin Wang, Junichi Yamagishi
Abstract: Audio deepfakes have reached a level of realism that makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and artificial voices, which poses risks such as identity theft or spread of disinformation. Despite these concerns, research on humans' ability to identify deepfakes is limited, with most studies focusing on English and very few exploring the reasons behind listeners' perceptual decisions. This study addresses this gap through a perceptual experiment in which 54 listeners (28 native Spanish speakers and 26 native Japanese speakers) classified voices as natural or synthetic, and justified their choices. The experiment included 80 stimuli (50% artificial), organized according to three variables: language (Spanish/Japanese), speech style (audiobooks/interviews), and familiarity with the voice (familiar/unfamiliar). The goal was to examine how these variables influence detection and to analyze qualitatively the reasoning behind listeners' perceptual decisions. Results indicate an average accuracy of 59.11%, with higher performance on authentic samples. Judgments of vocal naturalness rely on a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic cues. Comparing Japanese and Spanish listeners, our qualitative analysis further reveals both shared cues and notable cross-linguistic differences in how listeners conceptualize the "humanness" of speech. Overall, participants relied primarily on suprasegmental and higher-level or extralinguistic characteristics - such as intonation, rhythm, fluency, pauses, speed, breathing, and laughter - over segmental features. These findings underscore the complexity of human perceptual strategies in distinguishing natural from artificial speech and align partly with prior research emphasizing the importance of prosody and phenomena typical of spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies.

Title: SITP: A High-Reliability Semantic Information Transport Protocol Without Retransmission for Semantic Communication
Authors: Yunhao Wang, Shuai Ma, Youlong Wu, Guangming Shi, Xiang Cheng, Yuxuan Liu, Pengfei He
Abstract: With the evolution of 6G networks, modern communication systems are facing unprecedented demands for high reliability and low latency. However, conventional transport protocols are designed for bit-level reliability, failing to meet the semantic robustness requirements. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Information Transport Protocol (SITP), which achieves TCP-level reliability and UDP level latency by verifying only packet headers while retaining potentially corrupted payloads for semantic decoding. Building upon SITP, a cross-layer analytical model is established to quantify packet-loss probability across the physical, data-link, network, transport, and application layers. The model provides a unified probabilistic formulation linking signal noise rate (SNR) and packet-loss rate, offering theoretical foundation into end-to-end semantic transmission. Furthermore, a cross-image feature interleaving mechanism is developed to mitigate consecutive burst losses by redistributing semantic features across multiple correlated images, thereby enhancing robustness in burst-fade channels. Extensive experiments show that SITP offers lower latency than TCP with comparable reliability at low SNRs, while matching UDP-level latency and delivering superior reconstruction quality. In addition, the proposed cross-image semantic interleaving mechanism further demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating degradation caused by bursty packet losses.

Title: Electric Arc Furnaces Scheduling under Electricity Price Volatility with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ruonan Pi, Zhiyuan Fan, Bolun Xu
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for optimizing the operation of electric arc furnaces (EAFs) under volatile electricity prices. We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.

Title: Analysis of Frequency and Voltage Strength in Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems Based on Eigen-subsystems
Authors: Huisheng Gao, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Zhiyi Li, Ping Ju
Abstract: The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.

Title: NOC4SC: A Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-User Semantic Communication Framework for Interference-Resilient Transmission
Authors: Yunhao Wang, Shuai Ma, Pengfei He, Dahua Gao, Guangming Shi, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: With the explosive growth of connected devices and emerging applications, current wireless networks are encountering unprecedented demands for massive user access, where the inter-user interference has become a critical challenge to maintaining high quality of service (QoS) in multi-user communication systems. To tackle this issue, we propose a bandwidth-efficient semantic communication paradigm termed Non-Orthogonal Codewords for Semantic Communication (NOC4SC), which enables simultaneous same-frequency transmission without spectrum spreading. By leveraging the Swin Transformer, the proposed NOC4SC framework enables each user to independently extract semantic features through a unified encoder-decoder architecture with shared network parameters across all users, which ensures that the user's data remains protected from unauthorized decoding. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive NOC and SNR Modulation (NSM) block, which employs deep learning to dynamically regulate SNR and generate approximately orthogonal semantic features within distinct feature subspaces, thereby effectively mitigating inter-user interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed NOC4SC achieves comparable performance to the DeepJSCC-PNOMA and outperforms other multi-user SemCom baseline methods.

Title: Intelligent Resilience Testing for Decision-Making Agents with Dual-Mode Surrogate Adaptation
Authors: Jingxuan Yang, Weichao Xu, Yuchen Shi, Yi Zhang, Shuo Feng, Huaxin Pei
Abstract: Testing and evaluating decision-making agents remains challenging due to unknown system architectures, limited access to internal states, and the vastness of high-dimensional scenario spaces. Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents.

Title: Time-Discretized Simulation of Vehicle Platoons for Safety Analysis with Guaranteed Error Bounds
Authors: Yuhao Chen, Ahmet Cetinkaya
Abstract: Wireless communication is essential to achieve coordinated control in vehicle platoons. However, packet losses in wireless communication can cause critical safety issues when they occur in conjunction with sudden brakes. In this paper, we propose simulation-based methods that allow the study of such safety issues by determining the absolute minimum distance between vehicles over time for various control parameters that guarantee string stability. For our proposed time-discretized simulations, we provide two methods for selecting different time-step intervals to ensure that the error in distance approximation remains within specified bounds at all times. Through numerical examples we demonstrate that among control parameters that guarantee string stability some perform better than others under simultaneously occurring packet losses and sudden brakes.

Title: QSMnet-INR: Single-Orientation Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping via Implicit Neural Representation in k-Space
Authors: Xuan Cai, Ruo-Mi Guo, Xiao-Wen Luo, Jing Zhao, Silun Wang, Tao Tan, Yue Liu, Hongbin Han, Mengting Liu
Abstract: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) quantifies tissue magnetic susceptibility from magnetic-resonance phase data and plays a crucial role in brain microstructure imaging, iron-deposition assessment, and neurological-disease research. However, single-orientation QSM inversion remains highly ill-posed because the dipole kernel exhibits a cone-null region in the Fourier domain, leading to streaking artifacts and structural loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose QSMnet-INR, a deep, physics-informed framework that integrates an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) into the k-space domain. The INR module continuously models multi-directional dipole responses and explicitly completes the cone-null region, while a frequency-domain residual-weighted Dipole Loss enforces physical consistency. The overall network combines a 3D U-Net-based QSMnet backbone with the INR module through alternating optimization for end-to-end joint training. Experiments on the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge, a multi-orientation GRE dataset, and both in-house and public single-orientation clinical data demonstrate that QSMnet-INR consistently outperforms conventional and recent deep-learning approaches across multiple quantitative metrics. The proposed framework shows notable advantages in structural recovery within cone-null regions and in artifact suppression. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of the INR module and Dipole Loss to detail preservation and physical stability. Overall, QSMnet-INR effectively alleviates the ill-posedness of single-orientation QSM without requiring multi-orientation acquisition, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and strong cross-scenario generalization-highlighting its potential for clinical translation.

Title: Joint Channel Estimation and Localization in Pinching-Antenna OFDM Systems: The Blessing of Multipath
Authors: Min Liu, Yue Xiao, Shuaixin Yang, Gang Wu, Xianfu Lei, Wei Xiang
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their capability of flexibly reconfiguring large-scale wireless channels. Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity.

Title: Power Control of Multi-Layer Repeater Networks (POLARNet)
Authors: Johan Siwerson, Johan Thunberg
Abstract: In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.

Title: Personalized Building Climate Control with Contextual Preferential Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Wenbin Wang, Jicheng Shi, Colin N. Jones
Abstract: Efficient tuning of building climate controllers to optimize occupant utility is essential for ensuring overall comfort and satisfaction. However, this is a challenging task since the latent utility are difficult to measure directly. Time-varying contextual factors, such as outdoor temperature, further complicate the problem. To address these challenges, we propose a contextual preferential Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages binary preference feedback together with contextual information to enable efficient real-time controller tuning. We validate the approach by tuning an economic MPC controller on BOPTEST, a high-fidelity building simulation platform. Over a two-month simulation period, our method outperforms the baseline controller and achieves an improvement of up to 23% in utility. Moreover, for different occupant types, we demonstrate that the algorithm automatically adapts to individual preferences, enabling personalized controller tuning.

Title: Analytical and DNN-Aided Performance Evaluation of IRS-Assisted THz Communication Systems
Authors: Soumendu Das, Nagendra Kumar, Dharmendra Dixit
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication system, where the IRS facilitates connectivity between the source and destination nodes in the absence of a direct transmission path. The source-IRS and IRS-destination links are subject to various challenges, including atmospheric attenuation, asymmetric $\alpha$-$\mu$ distributed small-scale fading, and beam misalignment-induced pointing errors. The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading channels. Furthermore, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP), average channel capacity (ACC), and average symbol error rate (ASER) for rectangular QAM (RQAM) and hexagonal QAM (HQAM) schemes over the end-to-end (e2e) link. The impact of random co-phasing and phase quantization errors are also examined. In addition to the theoretical analysis, deep neural network-based frameworks are developed to predict key performance metrics, facilitating fast and accurate system evaluation without computationally intensive analytical computations. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime yields closed-form expressions for coding gain and diversity order, providing further insights into performance trends. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical formulations and present a comprehensive assessment of system behavior under practical conditions.

Title: CKM-Enabled Joint Spatial-Doppler Domain Clutter Suppression for Low-Altitude UAV ISAC
Authors: Zihan Xu, Zhiwen Zhou, Di Wu, Xiaoli Xu, Yong Zeng
Abstract: The rapid development of low-altitude economy has placed higher demands on the sensing of small-sized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets. However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets.

To achieve this, the two fundamental definitions, i.e., those based on either the use of (i) analytic signals or (ii) space vectors, together with the premises used for their formulation, are presented and their relationship shown. Lastly, an unified notation and terminology to avoid confusion is proposed.

Title: Temporal Windows of Integration for Multisensory Wireless Systems as Enablers of Physical AI
Authors: Anup Mishra, João Henrique Inacio de Souza, Petar Popovski
Abstract: Physical artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the AI that interacts with the physical world in real time. Similar to multisensory perception, Physical AI makes decisions based on multimodal updates from sensors and devices. Physical AI thus operates with a finite spatial footprint of its sensory tributaries. The multimodal updates traverse heterogeneous and unreliable paths, involving wireless links. Throughput or latency guarantees do not ensure correct decision-making, as misaligned, misordered, or stale inputs still yield wrong inferences. Preserving decision-time coherence hinges on three timing primitives at the network-application interface: (i) simultaneity, a short coincidence window that groups measurements as co-temporal, (ii) causality, path-wise delivery that never lets a consequence precede its precursor, and (iii) usefulness, a validity horizon that drops information too stale to influence the current action. In this work, we focus on usefulness and adopt temporal window of integration (TWI)-Causality: the TWI enforces decision-time usefulness by assuming path-wise causal consistency and cross-path simultaneity are handled upstream. We model end-to-end path delay as the sum of sensing/propagation, computation, and access/transmission latencies, and formulate network design as minimizing the validity horizon under a delivery reliability constraint. In effect, this calibrates delay-reliability budgets for a timing-aware system operating over sensors within a finite spatial footprint. The joint choice of horizon and per-path reliability is cast as a convex optimization problem, solved to global optimality to obtain the minimal horizon and per-path allocation of reliability. This is compared favourably to a benchmark based on uniform-after-threshold allocation. Overall, this study contributes to timing-aware Physical AI in next-generation networks.

Title: Real-Time Non-Smooth MPC for Switching Systems: Application to a Three-Tank Process
Authors: Hendrik Alsmeier, Felix Häusser, Andreas Knödler, Armin Nurkanović, Anton Pozharskiy, Moritz Diehl, Rolf Findeisen
Abstract: Real-time model predictive control of non-smooth switching systems remains challenging due to discontinuities and the presence of discrete modes, which complicate numerical integration and optimization. This paper presents a real-time feasible non-smooth model predictive control scheme for a physical three-tank process, implemented without mixed-integer formulations. The approach combines Filippov system modeling with finite elements and switch detection for time discretization, leading to a finite-dimensional optimal control problem formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. The mathematical program is solved via a homotopy of smooth nonlinear programs. We introduce modeling adjustments that make the three-tank dynamics numerically tractable, including additional modes to avoid non-Lipschitz points and undefined function values. Hardware experiments demonstrate efficient handling of switching events, mode-consistent tracking across reference changes, correct boundary handling, and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of model mismatch and show that the tracking performance and computation times remain within real-time limits for the chosen sampling time. The complete controller is implemented using the non-smooth optimal control framework NOSNOC

Title: RIS-Assisted Coordinated Multi-Point ISAC for Low-Altitude Sensing Coverage
Authors: Ying Zhang, Zeqi Hao, Tingting Zhang
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) has emerged and developed in various fields, which has gained considerable interest. To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the baseline schemes.

Title: Adaptive Optimal Control for Avatar-Guided Motor Rehabilitation in Virtual Reality
Authors: Francesco De Lellis, Maria Lombardi, Egidio De Benedetto, Pasquale Arpaia, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: A control-theoretic framework for autonomous avatar-guided rehabilitation in virtual reality, based on interpretable, adaptive motor guidance through optimal control, is presented. The framework faces critical challenges in motor rehabilitation due to accessibility, cost, and continuity of care, with over 50% of patients inability to attend regular clinic sessions. The system enables post-stroke patients to undergo personalized therapy in immersive virtual reality at home, while being monitored by clinicians. The core is a nonlinear, human-in-the-loop control strategy, where the avatar adapts in real time to the patient's performance. Balance between following the patient's movements and guiding them to ideal kinematic profiles based on the Hogan minimum-jerk model is achieved through multi-objective optimal control. A data-driven "ability index" uses smoothness metrics to dynamically adjust control gains according to the patient's progress. The system was validated through simulations and preliminary trials, and shows potential for delivering adaptive, engaging and scalable remote physiotherapy guided by interpretable control-theoretic principles.

Title: Dynamic one-time delivery of critical data by small and sparse UAV swarms: a model problem for MARL scaling studies
Authors: Mika Persson, Jonas Lidman, Jacob Ljungberg, Samuel Sandelius, Adam Andersson
Abstract: This work presents a conceptual study on the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for decentralized control of unmanned aerial vehicles to relay a critical data package to a known position. For this purpose, a family of deterministic games is introduced, designed for scaling studies for MARL. A robust baseline policy is proposed, which is based on restricting agent motion envelopes and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. Experimental results show that two off-the-shelf MARL algorithms perform competitively with the baseline for a small number of agents, but scalability issues arise as the number of agents increase.

Title: Robust Speech Activity Detection in the Presence of Singing Voice
Authors: Philipp Grundhuber, Mhd Modar Halimeh, Martin Strauß, Emanuël A. P. Habets
Abstract: Speech Activity Detection (SAD) systems often misclassify singing as speech, leading to degraded performance in applications such as dialogue enhancement and automatic speech recognition. We introduce Singing-Robust Speech Activity Detection ( SR-SAD ), a neural network designed to robustly detect speech in the presence of singing. Our key contributions are: i) a training strategy using controlled ratios of speech and singing samples to improve discrimination, ii) a computationally efficient model that maintains robust performance while reducing inference runtime, and iii) a new evaluation metric tailored to assess SAD robustness in mixed speech-singing scenarios. Experiments on a challenging dataset spanning multiple musical genres show that SR-SAD maintains high speech detection accuracy (AUC = 0.919) while rejecting singing. By explicitly learning to distinguish between speech and singing, SR-SAD enables more reliable SAD in mixed speech-singing scenarios.

Title: Flexible Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Covert Communications in UAV Networks
Authors: Chong Huang, Gaojie Chen, Zhuoao Xu, Jing Zhu, Taisong Pan, Rahim Tafazolli, Wei Huang
Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a key role in wireless communication networks due to their flexibility and dynamic adaptability. However, the openness of UAV-based communications leads to security and privacy concerns in wireless transmissions. This paper investigates a framework of UAV covert communications which introduces flexible reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (F-RIS) in UAV networks. Unlike traditional RIS, F-RIS provides advanced deployment flexibility by conforming to curved surfaces and dynamically reconfiguring its electromagnetic properties to enhance the covert communication performance. We establish an electromagnetic model for F-RIS and further develop a fitted model that describes the relationship between F-RIS reflection amplitude, reflection phase, and incident angle. To maximize the covert transmission rate among UAVs while meeting the covert constraint and public transmission constraint, we introduce a strategy of jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, F-RIS reflection vectors, F-RIS incident angles, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation. Considering this is a complicated non-convex optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm-based optimization solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework and optimization method significantly outperform traditional benchmarks, and highlight the advantages of F-RIS in enhancing covert communication performance within UAV networks.

Title: PathCo-LatticE: Pathology-Constrained Lattice-Of Experts Framework for Fully-supervised Few-Shot Cardiac MRI Segmentation
Authors: Mohamed Elbayumi, Mohammed S.M. Elbaz
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) mitigates data scarcity in cardiac MRI segmentation but typically relies on semi-supervised techniques sensitive to domain shifts and validation bias, restricting zero-shot generalizability. We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available].

Title: On the Ambiguity Function of OFDM-based ISAC Signals Under Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers
Authors: Eya Gourar, Yahia Medjahdi, Laurent Clavier, Abdul Karim Gizzini, Patrick Sondi
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has garnered significant attention as a promising technology for next-generation wireless and vehicular communications. Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals.

Title: Energy-Efficient Federated Learning with Relay-Assisted Aggregation in IIoT Networks
Authors: Hamid Reza Hashempour, Mostafa Nozari, Gilberto Berardinelli, Yanjiao Li, Jie Zhang, Hien Quoc Ngo, Shashi Raj Pandey
Abstract: This paper presents an energy-efficient transmission framework for federated learning (FL) in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments with strict latency and energy constraints. Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission.

Title: Resilient Neural-Variable-Structure Consensus Control for Nonlinear MASs with Singular Input Gain Under DoS Attacks
Authors: Ladan Khoshnevisan, Xinzhi Liu
Abstract: This paper proposes a reliable learning-based adaptive control framework for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and singular control gains, two critical challenges in cyber-physical systems. A neural-variable-structure adaptive controller is developed to achieve leader-follower consensus while ensuring robustness to external disturbances and adaptability to unknown nonlinear dynamics. A reliability-assessment rule is introduced to detect communication loss during DoS attacks, upon which a switched control mechanism is activated to preserve closed-loop stability and performance. Unlike existing resilient MAS control methods, the proposed strategy explicitly accommodates singular control gains and does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity or prior bounds on nonlinearities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to integrate neural learning, variable-structure robustness, and reliability-based switching into a unified consensus-tracking control architecture for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs with singular input gains under DoS attacks. Lyapunov-based analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals, and Matlab/Simulink simulations on a connected automated vehicle platoon demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resilience.

Title: A Speculative GLRT-Backed Approach for Adversarial Resilience on Deep Learning-Based Array Processing
Authors: Nian-Cin Wang, Rajeev Sahay
Abstract: Classical array processing methods such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provide statistically grounded solutions for signal detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, but their high computational cost limits their use in low-latency settings. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition Through Integrated Noise Detection Architecture
Authors: Karamvir Singh
Abstract: This research presents a novel approach to enhancing automatic speech recognition systems by integrating noise detection capabilities directly into the recognition architecture. Building upon the wav2vec2 framework, the proposed method incorporates a dedicated noise identification module that operates concurrently with speech transcription. Experimental validation using publicly available speech and environmental audio datasets demonstrates substantial improvements in transcription quality and noise discrimination. The enhanced system achieves superior performance in word error rate, character error rate, and noise detection accuracy compared to conventional architectures. Results indicate that joint optimization of transcription and noise classification objectives yields more reliable speech recognition in challenging acoustic conditions.

Title: Cyqlone: A Parallel, High-Performance Linear Solver for Optimal Control
Authors: Pieter Pas, Panagiotis Patrinos
Abstract: We present Cyqlone, a solver for linear systems with a stage-wise optimal control structure that fully exploits the various levels of parallelism available in modern hardware. Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver. Open-source C++ implementations of Cyqlone and CyQPALM are available at this https URL

Title: Exposing Vulnerabilities in Counterfeit Prevention Systems Utilizing Physically Unclonable Surface Features
Authors: Anirudh Nakra, Nayeeb Rashid, Chau-Wai Wong, Min Wu
Abstract: Counterfeit products pose significant risks to public health and safety through infiltrating untrusted supply chains. Among numerous anti-counterfeiting techniques, leveraging inherent, unclonable microscopic irregularities of paper surfaces is an accurate and cost-effective solution. Prior work of this approach has focused on enabling ubiquitous acquisition of these physically unclonable features (PUFs). However, we will show that existing authentication methods relying on paper surface PUFs may be vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in a gap between technological feasibility and secure real-world deployment. This gap is investigated through formalizing an operational framework for paper-PUF-based authentication. Informed by this framework, we reveal system-level vulnerabilities across both physical and digital domains, designing physical denial-of-service and digital forgery attacks to disrupt proper authentication. The effectiveness of the designed attacks underscores the strong need for security countermeasures for reliable and resilient authentication based on paper PUFs. The proposed framework further facilitates a comprehensive, stage-by-stage security analysis, guiding the design of future counterfeit prevention systems. This analysis delves into potential attack strategies, offering a foundational understanding of how various system components, such as physical features and verification processes, might be exploited by adversaries.

Title: Rates and architectures for learning geometrically non-trivial operators
Authors: T. Mitchell Roddenberry, Leo Tzou, Ivan Dokmanić, Maarten V. de Hoop, Richard G. Baraniuk
Abstract: Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.

Title: NeuroSketch: An Effective Framework for Neural Decoding via Systematic Architectural Optimization
Authors: Gaorui Zhang, Zhizhang Yuan, Jialan Yang, Junru Chen, Li Meng, Yang Yang
Abstract: Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding.

Title: A tensor phase theory with applications in multilinear control
Authors: Chengdong Liu, Yimin Wei, Guofeng Zhang
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to initiate a phase theory for tensors under the Einstein product, and explore its applications in multilinear control systems. Firstly, the sectorial tensor decomposition for sectorial tensors is derived, which allows us to define phases for sectorial tensors. A numerical procedure for computing phases of a sectorial tensor is also proposed. Secondly, the maximin and minimax expressions for tensor phases are given, which are used to quantify how close the phases of a sectorial tensor are to those of its compressions. Thirdly, the compound spectrum, compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of two sectorial tensors $A,B$ are defined and characterized in terms of the compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of the sectorial tensors $A,B$. Fourthly, it is shown that the angles of eigenvalues of the product of two sectorial tensors are upper bounded by the sum of their individual phases. Finally, based on the tensor phase theory developed above, a tensor version of the small phase theorem is presented, which can be regarded as a natural generalization of the matrix case, recently proposed in Ref. [10]. The results offer powerful new tools for the stability and robustness analysis of multilinear feedback control systems.

Authors: Antonio Terpin, Alan Bonomi, Francesco Banelli, Raffaello D'Andrea
Abstract: We describe SynthPix, a synthetic image generator for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with a focus on performance and parallelism on accelerators, implemented in JAX. SynthPix supports the same configuration parameters as existing tools but achieves a throughput several orders of magnitude higher in image-pair generation per second. SynthPix was developed to enable the training of data-hungry reinforcement learning methods for flow estimation and for reducing the iteration times during the development of fast flow estimation methods used in recent active fluids control studies with real-time PIV feedback. We believe SynthPix to be useful for the fluid dynamics community, and in this paper we describe the main ideas behind this software package.

Title: An Automated Tip-and-Cue Framework for Optimized Satellite Tasking and Visual Intelligence
Authors: Gil Weissman, Amir Ivry, Israel Cohen
Abstract: The proliferation of satellite constellations, coupled with reduced tasking latency and diverse sensor capabilities, has expanded the opportunities for automated Earth observation. This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.

Title: LiM-YOLO: Less is More with Pyramid Level Shift and Normalized Auxiliary Branch for Ship Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
Authors: Seon-Hoon Kim, Hyeji Sim, Youeyun Jung, Ok-Chul Jung, Yerin Kim
Abstract: Applying general-purpose object detectors to ship detection in satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to the extreme scale disparity and morphological anisotropy of maritime targets. Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: TinyDéjàVu: Smaller Memory Footprint & Faster Inference on Sensor Data Streams with Always-On Microcontrollers
Authors: Zhaolan Huang, Emmanuel Baccelli
Abstract: Always-on sensors are increasingly expected to embark a variety of tiny neural networks and to continuously perform inference on time-series of the data they sense. In order to fit lifetime and energy consumption requirements when operating on battery, such hardware uses microcontrollers (MCUs) with tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. In this context, optimizing data flows across neural network layers becomes crucial. In this paper, we introduce TinyDéjàVu, a new framework and novel algorithms we designed to drastically reduce the RAM footprint required by inference using various tiny ML models for sensor data time-series on typical microcontroller hardware. We publish the implementation of TinyDéjàVu as open source, and we perform reproducible benchmarks on hardware. We show that TinyDéjàVu can save more than 60% of RAM usage and eliminate up to 90% of redundant compute on overlapping sliding window inputs.

Title: Visual Heading Prediction for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Reza Ahmari, Ahmad Mohammadi, Vahid Hemmati, Mohammed Mynuddin, Parham Kebria, Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud, Xiaohong Yuan, Abdollah Homaifar
Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions. A demonstration video showcasing the system's real-time performance, including UGV detection, heading angle prediction, and UAV alignment under dynamic conditions, is available at: this https URL

Title: Link-Sharing Backpressure Routing In Wireless Multi-Hop Networks
Authors: Zhongyuan Zhao, Yujun Ming, Ananthram Swami, Kevin Chan, Fikadu Dagefu, Santiago Segarra
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is an established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, noted for its fully distributed operation and maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.

Title: Control Node Placement and Structural Controllability of Water Quality Dynamics in Drinking Networks
Authors: Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, needs to be adequately distributed in water distribution networks (WDNs) to maintain consistent residual levels and ensure safe water. This is performed through control node injections at the treatment plant via booster stations distributed across the WDNs. While previous studies have applied various optimization-based approaches for booster station placement, many have failed to consider the coverage of the station injections and the dynamic nature of WDNs. In particular, variations in hydraulics and demand significantly impact the reachability and efficacy of chlorine injections which then impact optimal placement of booster stations. This study introduces a novel formulation that combines control- and graph-theoretic approaches to solve the booster station placement problem. Unlike traditional methods, our approach emphasizes maximizing the system's ability to control disinfectant levels with minimal control energy, taking into account the time-varying hydraulic profiles that lead to different optimal station placements. We propose a simple weighting technique to determine the placements by assessing the structural controllability of each configuration, based on the network's topology, independent of specific parameters like decay rates or pipe roughness. This method ensures effective chlorine coverage across the network. Our approach is validated on different networks, demonstrating its operational effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.

Title: INRetouch: Context Aware Implicit Neural Representation for Photography Retouching
Authors: Omar Elezabi, Marcos V. Conde, Zongwei Wu, Radu Timofte
Abstract: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, and is capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

Title: SEAL: Speech Embedding Alignment Learning for Speech Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Chunyu Sun, Bingyu Liu, Zhichao Cui, Junhan Shi, Anbin Qi, Tian-hao Zhang, Dinghao Zhou, Lewei Lu
Abstract: Embedding-based retrieval models have made significant strides in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for text and multimodal large language models (LLMs) applications. However, when it comes to speech larage language models (SLLMs), these methods are limited to a two-stage process, where automatic speech recognition (ASR) is combined with text-based retrieval. This sequential architecture suffers from high latency and error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a unified embedding framework that eliminates the need for intermediate text representations. Specifically, the framework includes separate speech and text encoders, followed by a shared scaling layer that maps both modalities into a common embedding space. Our model reduces pipeline latency by 50\% while achieving higher retrieval accuracy compared to traditional two-stage methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the challenges inherent in end-to-end speech retrieval and introduce architectural principles for effective speech-to-document matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across diverse acoustic conditions and speaker variations, paving the way for a new paradigm in multimodal SLLMs retrieval systems.

Title: System Identification Under Multi-rate Sensing Environment
Authors: Hiroshi Okajima, Risa Furukawa, Nobutomo Matsunaga
Abstract: This paper proposes a system identification algorithm for systems with multi-rate sensors in a discrete-time framework. It is challenging to obtain an accurate mathematical model when the ratios of inputs and outputs are different in the system. A cyclic reformulation-based model for multi-rate systems is formulated, and the multi-rate system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system to derive the model under the multi-rate sensing environment. The proposed algorithm integrates a cyclic reformulation with a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system to enable precise identification of systems under the multi-rate sensing environment. The effectiveness of the proposed system identification method is demonstrated using numerical simulations.

Title: No-Regret Learning in Stackelberg Games with an Application to Electric Ride-Hailing
Authors: Anna Maddux, Marko Maljkovic, Nikolas Geroliminis, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently learning to play single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg games when the leader lacks knowledge of the lower-level game. Such games arise in hierarchical decision-making problems involving self-interested agents. For example, in electric ride-hailing markets, a central authority aims to learn optimal charging prices to shape fleet distributions and charging patterns of ride-hailing companies. Existing works typically apply gradient-based methods to find the leader's optimal strategy. Such methods are impractical as they require that the followers share private utility information with the leader. Instead, we treat the lower-level game as a black box, assuming only that the followers' interactions approximate a Nash equilibrium while the leader observes the realized cost of the resulting approximation. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the leader's cost function, we develop a no-regret algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium in $O(\sqrt{T})$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on optimal pricing in electric ride-hailing markets.

Title: Machine Learning-Driven Adaptive Power Allocation for Optical Wireless Networks
Authors: Walter Zibusiso Ncube, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani
Abstract: Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) have gained popularity in Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) due to their high modulation bandwidth, narrow spectral width, and directional beam, offering improved spectral efficiency and reduced multipath dispersion compared to Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In this work, we explore the deployment of VCSELs as Access Points (APs) in an indoor environment under mobility and time varying user distributions. To enhance performance, a Merged Access Point (MAP) topology is introduced to extend the serving area of each cell, whilst Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding is employed for inter user interference management. A sum rate maximisation problem is then formulated to maintain high quality network operation in the dynamic environment. Although deterministic methods can solve the formulated problem, they become impractical in real time due to computational complexity, particularly under high user mobility and rapidly changing channel conditions. To address this, we propose a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) based solution combining a low complexity distance based user association algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for adaptive power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid association CNN framework achieves near optimal performance while substantially reducing computation complexity relative to optimisation based schemes. Furthermore, it operates in real time, with measured median and P95 inference latencies in the millisecond range, and maintains a small empirical worst-case gap to the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimum, demonstrating both practicality and robustness under mobility.

Title: No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman Operators
Authors: Hongyu Zhou, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems with unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such residual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically, the algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume the algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown dynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown residual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a self-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole system aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.

Title: Low Complexity Weight Flexible Decoding Schemes of Linear Block Code for 6G xURLLC
Authors: Di Zhang, Yinglei Yang, Zilong Liu, Shaobo Jia, Kyungchun Lee, Zhirong Zhang
Abstract: Low complexity error correction code is a key enabler for next generation ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) in six generation (6G). Against this background, this paper proposes a decoding scheme for linear block code by leveraging certain interesting properties of dual codewords. It is found that dual codewords with flexible weights can provide useful decoding information for the locations and magnitudes of error bits, which yielding higher reliability performance. In addition, two decoding schemes are proposed, in which one directly utilizes intrinsic information for iterative decoding, and the other combines prior channel information with intrinsic information for decoding. Both schemes are implemented using vector multiplication and real-number comparisons, making them easy to implement in hardware. Simulation results demonstrate the validness of our study.

Title: Control Synthesis with Reinforcement Learning: A Modeling Perspective
Authors: Nikki Xu, Hien Tran
Abstract: Controllers designed with reinforcement learning can be sensitive to model mismatch. We demonstrate that designing such controllers in a virtual simulation environment with an inaccurate model is not suitable for deployment in a physical setup. Controllers designed using an accurate model is robust against disturbance and small mismatch between the physical setup and the mathematical model derived from first principles; while a poor model results in a controller that performs well in simulation but fails in physical experiments. Sensitivity analysis is used to justify these discrepancies and an empirical region of attraction estimation help us visualize their robustness.

Title: Model-free Adaptive Output Feedback Vibration Suppression in a Cantilever Beam
Authors: Juan Augusto Paredes Salazar, Ankit Goel
Abstract: This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.

Title: Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)
Authors: Kooktae Lee, Ethan Brook
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance. This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations. Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.

Title: A Low-Complexity Speech Codec Using Parametric Dithering for ASR
Authors: Ellison Murray, Morriel Kasher, Predrag Spasojevic
Abstract: Dithering is a technique commonly used to improve the perceptual quality of lossy data compression. In this work, we analytically and experimentally justify the use of dithering for ASR input compression. We formalize an understanding of optimal ASR performance under lossy input compression and leverage this to propose a parametric dithering technique for a low-complexity speech compression pipeline. The method performs well at 1-bit resolution, showing a 25\% relative CER improvement, while also demonstrating improvements of 32.4\% and 33.5\% at 2- and 3-bit resolution, respectively, with our second dither choice yielding a reduced data rate. The proposed codec is adaptable to meet performance targets or stay within entropy constraints.

Title: InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Power Grid Control
Authors: Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tinko Sebastian Bartels, Tongxin Li
Abstract: The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor (CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.

Title: Stronger is not better: Better Augmentations in Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Azeez Idris, Abdurahman Ali Mohammed, Samuel Fanijo
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning is among the recent representation learning methods that have shown performance gains in several downstream tasks including semantic segmentation. This paper evaluates strong data augmentation, one of the most important components for self-supervised contrastive learning's improved performance. Strong data augmentation involves applying the composition of multiple augmentation techniques on images. Surprisingly, we find that the existing data augmentations do not always improve performance for semantic segmentation for medical images. We experiment with other augmentations that provide improved performance.

Title: Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter
Authors: Minhyuk Jang, Astghik Hakobyan, Insoon Yang
Abstract: In this work, we propose a noise-centric formulation of the distributionally robust Kalman filter (DRKF) for discrete-time linear stochastic systems with uncertain noise statistics. By placing Wasserstein ambiguity sets directly on the process and measurement noise distributions, the proposed DRKF preserves the analytical structure of the classical Kalman filter while providing a priori spectral bounds on all feasible covariances. In the time-invariant setting, we derive a steady-state DRKF from a single stationary semidefinite program, yielding a constant-gain estimator with the same per-step computational complexity as the standard Kalman filter. We establish conditions guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of this steady-state solution, and we prove its asymptotic minimax optimality with respect to the worst-case mean-square error. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that the proposed DRKF improves estimation accuracy under unknown or uncertain noise models while offering computational advantages over existing robust and distributionally robust filters.

Title: CARTOS: A Charging-Aware Real-Time Operating System for Intermittent Batteryless Devices
Authors: Mohsen Karimi, Yidi Wang, Youngbin Kim, Yoojin Lim, Hyoseung Kim
Abstract: This paper presents CARTOS, a charging-aware real-time operating system designed to enhance the functionality of intermittently-powered batteryless devices (IPDs) for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While IPDs offer significant advantages such as extended lifespan and operability in extreme environments, they pose unique challenges, including the need to ensure forward progress of program execution amidst variable energy availability and maintaining reliable real-time time behavior during power disruptions. To address these challenges, CARTOS introduces a mixed-preemption scheduling model that classifies tasks into computational and peripheral tasks, and ensures their efficient and timely execution by adopting just-in-time checkpointing for divisible computation tasks and uninterrupted execution for indivisible peripheral tasks. CARTOS also supports processing chains of tasks with precedence constraints and adapts its scheduling in response to environmental changes to offer continuous execution under diverse conditions. CARTOS is implemented with new APIs and components added to FreeRTOS but is designed for portability to other embedded RTOSs. Through real hardware experiments and simulations, CARTOS exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that it can serve as a practical platform for developing resilient, real-time sensing applications on IPDs.

Title: Point Neuron Learning: A New Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture
Authors: Hanwen Bi, Thushara D. Abhayapala
Abstract: Machine learning and neural networks have advanced numerous research domains, but challenges such as large training data requirements and inconsistent model performance hinder their application in certain scientific problems. To overcome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics principles into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided loss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii) physics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated success across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including being trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted generalizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding the fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture, enabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed point neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on microphone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods, our approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better interpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant environment. Results indicate that the point neuron method outperforms two competing methods and can efficiently handle noisy environments with sparse microphone observations.

Title: Tokenizing Motion: A Generative Approach for Scene Dynamics Compression
Authors: Shanzhi Yin, Zihan Zhang, Bolin Chen, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

Title: CardioLive: Empowering Video Streaming with Online Cardiac Monitoring
Authors: Sheng Lyu, Ruiming Huang, Sijie Ji, Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman, Lan Ma, Chenshu Wu
Abstract: Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.

Title: MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment
Authors: Hao Zhou, Xiaobao Guo, Yuzhe Zhu, Adams Wai-Kin Kong
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-modal task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called MACS to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, effective image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 out of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality.

Title: Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems
Authors: Zhidi Lin, Ying Li, Feng Yin, Juan Maroñas, Alexandre H. Thiéry
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive non-stationary implicit process prior that can capture complex transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

Title: C*: A Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments using Rapidly Covering Graphs
Authors: Zongyuan Shen, James P. Wilson, Shalabh Gupta
Abstract: The paper presents a novel sample-based algorithm, called C*, for real-time coverage path planning (CPP) of unknown environments. C* is built upon the concept of a Rapidly Covering Graph (RCG), which is incrementally constructed during robot navigation via progressive sampling of the search space. By using efficient sampling and pruning techniques, the RCG is constructed to be a minimum-sufficient graph, where its nodes and edges form the potential waypoints and segments of the coverage trajectory, respectively. The RCG tracks the coverage progress, generates the coverage trajectory and helps the robot to escape from the dead-end situations. To minimize coverage time, C* produces the desired back-and-forth coverage pattern, while adapting to the TSP-based optimal coverage of local isolated regions, called coverage holes, which are surrounded by obstacles and covered regions. It is analytically proven that C* provides complete coverage of unknown environments. The algorithmic simplicity and low computational complexity of C* make it easy to implement and suitable for real-time on-board applications. The performance of C* is validated by 1) extensive high-fidelity simulations and 2) laboratory experiments using an autonomous robot. C* yields near optimal trajectories, and a comparative evaluation with seven existing CPP methods demonstrates significant improvements in performance in terms of coverage time, number of turns, trajectory length, and overlap ratio, while preventing the formation of coverage holes. Finally, C* is comparatively evaluated on two different CPP applications using 1) energy-constrained robots and 2) multi-robot teams.

Title: MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nikolai Lund Kühne, Jesper Jensen, Jan Østergaard, Zheng-Hua Tan
Abstract: With new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform the state-of-the-art in single-channel speech enhancement and audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VB-DemandEx, a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, MambAttention significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 without reverberation and EARS-WHAM_v2. MambAttention also matches or outperforms generative diffusion models in generalization performance while being competitive with language model baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of weight sharing between time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. Yet, MambAttention remains superior for cross-corpus generalization across all reported evaluation metrics.

Title: Hybrid A* Path Planning with Multi-Modal Motion Extension for Four-Wheel Steering Mobile Robots
Authors: Runjiao Bao, Lin Zhang, Tianwei Niu, Haoyu Yuan, Shoukun Wang
Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of 4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A* framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments.

Title: Open ASR Leaderboard: Towards Reproducible and Transparent Multilingual Speech Recognition Evaluation
Authors: Vaibhav Srivastav, Steven Zheng, Eric Bezzam, Eustache Le Bihan, Adel Moumen, Sanchit Gandhi
Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including a dedicated multilingual track. We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible evaluation.

Title: EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet
Authors: Joel Poncha Lemayian, Ghyslain Gagnon, Kaiwen Zhang, Pascal Giard
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating, storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA
