Title: SYNAPSE: Synergizing an Adapter and Finetuning for High-Fidelity EEG Synthesis from a CLIP-Aligned Encoder
Authors: Jeyoung Lee, Hochul Kang
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based generative models has enabled high-quality image synthesis conditioned on diverse modalities. Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation.

Title: Semantic-driven Wireless Environment Knowledge Representation for Efficiency-Accuracy Balanced Beam Prediction in Vehicular Networks
Authors: Jialin Wang, Jianhua Zhang, Yu Li, Yutong Sun, Yuxiang Zhang
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the internet of vehicles demands ultra-reliable low-latency communication in high-mobility environments, where conventional beam prediction methods suffer from high-dimensional inputs, prolonged training times, and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, the propagation environment semantics-aware wireless environment knowledge beam prediction (PES-WEKBP) framework is proposed. PES-WEKBP pioneers a novel electromagnetic (EM)-grounded knowledge distillation method, transforming raw visual data into an ultra-lean, interpretable material and location-related wireless environment knowledge matrix. This matrix explicitly encodes critical propagation environment semantics, which is material EM properties and spatial relationships through a physics-informed parameterization process, distilling the environment and channel interplay into a minimal yet information-dense representation. A lightweight decision network then leverages this highly compressed knowledge for low-complexity beam prediction. To holistically evaluate the performance of PES-WEKBP, we first design the prediction consistency-efficiency index (PCEI), which combines prediction accuracy with a stability-penalized logarithmic training time to ensure a balanced optimization of reliability and computational efficiency. Experiments validate that PES-WEKBP achieves a 99.75% to 99.96% dimension reduction and improves accuracy by 5.52% to 8.19%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PCEI scores across diverse vehicular scenarios.

Title: Speech Recognition Model Improves Text-to-Speech Synthesis using Fine-Grained Reward
Authors: Guansu Wang, Peijie Sun
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) have enabled models to clone arbitrary unseen speakers and synthesize high-quality, natural-sounding speech. However, evaluation methods lag behind: typical mean opinion score (MOS) estimators perform regression over entire utterances, while failures usually occur in a few problematic words. We observe that encoder-decoder ASR models (e.g., Whisper) surface word-level mismatches between speech and text via cross-attention, providing a fine-grained reward signal. Building on this, we introduce Word-level TTS Alignment by ASR-driven Attentive Reward (W3AR). Without explicit reward annotations, W3AR uses attention from a pre-trained ASR model to drive finer-grained alignment and optimization of sequences predicted by a TTS model. Experiments show that W3AR improves the quality of existing TTS systems and strengthens zero-shot robustness on unseen speakers. More broadly, our results suggest a simple recipe for generative modeling: understanding models can act as evaluators, delivering informative, fine-grained feedback for optimization.

Title: WaveC2R: Wavelet-Driven Coarse-to-Refined Hierarchical Learning for Radar Retrieval
Authors: Chunlei Shi, Han Xu, Yinghao Li, Yi-Lin Wei, Yongchao Feng, Yecheng Zhang, Dan Niu
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.

Title: SALPA: Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment for Enhanced GEDI Footprint Geolocation
Authors: Narumasa Tsutsumida, Rei Mitsuhashi, Yoshito Sawada, Akira Kato
Abstract: Spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, such as NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide forest structure for global carbon assessments. However, geolocation uncertainties (typically 5-15 m) propagate systematically through derived products, undermining forest profile estimates, including carbon stock assessments. Existing correction methods face critical limitations: waveform simulation approaches achieve meter-level accuracy but require high-resolution LiDAR data unavailable in most regions, while terrain-based methods employ deterministic grid searches that may overlook optimal solutions in continuous solution spaces. We present SALPA (Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment), a multi-algorithm optimization framework integrating three optimization paradigms with five distance metrics. Operating exclusively with globally available digital elevation models and geoid data, SALPA explores continuous solution spaces through gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence approaches. Validation across contrasting sites: topographically complex Nikko, Japan, and flat Landes, France, demonstrates 15-16% improvements over original GEDI positions and 0.5-2% improvements over the state-of-the-art GeoGEDI algorithm. L-BFGS-B with Area-based metrics achieves optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, while population-based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization) excel in complex terrain. The platform-agnostic framework facilitates straightforward adaptation to emerging spaceborne LiDAR missions, providing a generalizable foundation for universal geolocation correction essential for reliable global forest monitoring and climate policy decisions.

Title: Reconfigurable, large-format D-ToF/photon-counting SPAD image sensors with embedded FPGA for scene adaptability
Authors: Tommaso Milanese, Baris Can Efe, Claudio Bruschini, Nobukazu Teranishi, Edoardo Charbon
Abstract: CMOS-compatible single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have emerged in many systems as the solution of choice for cameras with photon-number resolution and photon counting capabilities. Being natively digital optical interfaces, SPADs are naturally drawn to in situ logic processing and event-driven computation; they are usually coupled to discrete FPGAs to enable reconfigurability. In this work, we propose to bring the FPGA on-chip, in direct contact with the SPADs at pixel or cluster level. To demonstrate the suitability of this approach, we created an architecture for processing timestamps and photon counts using programmable weighted sums based on an efficient use of look-up tables. The outputs are processed hierarchically, similarly to what is done in FPGAs, reducing power consumption and simplifying I/Os. Finally, we show how artificial neural networks can be designed and reprogrammed by using look-up tables in an efficient way.

Title: Risk-Based Capacity Accreditation of Resource-Colocated Large Loads in Capacity Markets
Authors: Siying Li, Lang Tong, Timothy D. Mount
Abstract: We study capacity accreditation of resource-colocated large loads, defined as large demands such as data center and manufacturing loads colocated with behind-the-meter generation and storage resources, synchronously connected to the bulk power system, and capable of participating in the wholesale electricity market as an integrated unit. Because the qualified capacity of a resource portfolio is not equal to the sum of its individual resources' qualified capacities, we propose a novel risk-based capacity accreditation framework that evaluates the collective contribution to system reliability. Grounded in the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) metric, the proposed capacity accreditation employs a convex optimization engine that jointly dispatches colocated resources to minimize reliability risk. We apply the developed methodology to a hydrogen manufacturing facility with colocated renewable generation, storage, and fuel cell resources.

Title: Safety and Risk Pathways in Cooperative Generative Multi-Agent Systems: A Telecom Perspective
Authors: Zeinab Nezami, Shehr Bano, Abdelaziz Salama, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
Abstract: Generative multiagent systems are rapidly emerging as transformative tools for scalable automation and adaptive decisionmaking in telecommunications. Despite their promise, these systems introduce novel risks that remain underexplored, particularly when agents operate asynchronously across layered architectures. This paper investigates key safety pathways in telecomfocused Generative MultiAgent Systems (GMAS), emphasizing risks of miscoordination and semantic drift shaped by persona diversity. We propose a modular safety evaluation framework that integrates agentlevel checks on code quality and compliance with systemlevel safety metrics. Using controlled simulations across 32 persona sets, five questions, and multiple iterative runs, we demonstrate progressive improvements in analyzer penalties and AllocatorCoder consistency, alongside persistent vulnerabilities such as policy drift and variability under specific persona combinations. Our findings provide the first domaingrounded evidence that persona design, coding style, and planning orientation directly influence the stability and safety of telecom GMAS, highlighting both promising mitigation strategies and open risks for future deployment.

Abstract: Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a vision threatening development in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management.

Title: Generative MR Multitasking with complex-harmonic cardiac encoding: Bridging the gap between gated imaging and real-time imaging
Authors: Xinguo Fang, Anthony G. Christodoulou
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a unified image reconstruction framework that bridges real-time and gated cardiac MRI, including quantitative MRI. Methods: We introduce Generative Multitasking, which learns an implicit neural temporal basis from sequence timings and an interpretable latent space for cardiac and respiratory motion. Cardiac motion is modeled as a complex harmonic, with phase encoding timing and a latent amplitude capturing beat-to-beat functional variability, linking cardiac phase-resolved ("gated-like") and time-resolved ("real-time-like") views. We implemented the framework using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and evaluated it for free-breathing, non-ECG-gated radial GRE in three settings: steady-state cine imaging, multicontrast T2prep/IR imaging, and dual-flip-angle T1/T2 mapping, compared with conventional Multitasking. Results: Generative Multitasking provided flexible cardiac motion representation, enabling reconstruction of archetypal cardiac phase-resolved cines (like gating) as well as time-resolved series that reveal beat-to-beat variability (like real-time imaging). Conditioning on the previous k-space angle and modifying this term at inference removed eddy-current artifacts without globally smoothing high temporal frequencies. For quantitative mapping, Generative Multitasking reduced intraseptal T1 and T2 coefficients of variation compared with conventional Multitasking (T1: 0.13 vs. 0.31; T2: 0.12 vs. 0.32; p<0.001), indicating higher SNR. Conclusion: Generative Multitasking uses a CVAE with complex harmonic cardiac coordinates to unify gated and real-time CMR within a single free-breathing, non-ECG-gated acquisition. It allows flexible cardiac motion representation, suppresses trajectory-dependent artifacts, and improves T1 and T2 mapping, suggesting a path toward cine, multicontrast, and quantitative imaging without separate gated and real-time scans.

Title: A Versatile Optical Frontend for Multicolor Fluorescence Imaging with Miniaturized Lensless Sensors
Authors: Lukas Harris, Micah Roschelle, Jack Bartley, Mekhail Anwar
Abstract: Lensless imaging enables exceptionally compact fluorescence sensors, advancing applications in \textit{in vivo} imaging and low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics. These sensors require a filter to block the excitation light while passing fluorescent emissions. However, conventional thin-film interference filters are sensitive to angle of incidence (AOI), complicating their use in lensless systems. Here we thoroughly analyze and optimize a technique using a fiber optic plate (FOP) to absorb off-axis light that would bleed through the interference filter while improving image resolution. Through simulations, we show that the numerical aperture (NA) of the FOP drives inherent design tradeoffs: collection efficiency improves rapidly with a higher NA, but at the cost of resolution, increased device thickness, and fluorescence excitation efficiency. To illustrate this, we optimize two optical frontends with full-width at half maximums (FWHMs) of 8.3° and 45.7°. Implementing these designs, we show that angle-insensitivity requires filters on both sides of the FOP, due to scattering. In imaging experiments, the 520-$\mu$m-thick high-NA design is 59$\times$ more sensitive to fluorescence while only degrading resolution by 3.2$\times$. Alternatively, the low-NA design is capable of three-color fluorescence imaging with 110-$\mu$m resolution at a 1-mm working distance. Overall, we demonstrate a versatile optical frontend that is adaptable to a range of applications using different fluorophores, illumination configurations, and lensless imaging techniques.

Title: Generative Model Predictive Control in Manufacturing Processes: A Review
Authors: Suk Ki Lee, Ronnie F. P. Stone, Max Gao, Wenlong Zhang, Zhenghui Sha, Hyunwoong Ko
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are inherently dynamic and uncertain, with varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors, making robust control essential for maintaining quality and reliability. Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.

Title: INT-DTT+: Low-Complexity Data-Dependent Transforms for Video Coding
Authors: Samuel Fernández-Menduiña, Eduardo Pavez, Antonio Ortega, Tsung-Wei Huang, Thuong Nguyen Canh, Guan-Ming Su, Peng Yin
Abstract: Discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), such as the DCT-2 and the DST-7, are widely used in video codecs for their balance between coding performance and computational efficiency. In contrast, data-dependent transforms, such as the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) and graph-based separable transforms (GBSTs), offer better energy compaction but lack symmetries that can be exploited to reduce computational complexity. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a general framework to design low-complexity data-dependent transforms. Our approach builds on DTT+, a family of GBSTs derived from rank-one updates of the DTT graphs, which can adapt to signal statistics while retaining a structure amenable to fast computation. We first propose a graph learning algorithm for DTT+ that estimates the rank-one updates for rows and column graphs jointly, capturing the statistical properties of the overall block. Then, we exploit the progressive structure of DTT+ to decompose the kernel into a base DTT and a structured Cauchy matrix. By leveraging low-complexity integer DTTs and sparsifying the Cauchy matrix, we construct an integer approximation to DTT+, termed INT-DTT+. This approximation significantly reduces both computational and memory complexities with respect to the separable KLT with minimal performance loss. We validate our approach in the context of mode-dependent transforms for the VVC standard, following a rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) design approach. Integrated into the explicit multiple transform selection (MTS) framework of VVC in a rate-distortion optimization setup, INT-DTT+ achieves more than 3% BD-rate savings over the VVC MTS baseline, with complexity comparable to the integer DCT-2 once the base DTT coefficients are available.

Title: TransLK-Net: Entangling Transformer and Large Kernel for Progressive and Collaborative Feature Encoding and Decoding in Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Jin Yang, Daniel S.Marcus, Aristeidis Sotiras
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are widely employed for medical image segmentation, but they are still challenged by their intrinsic characteristics. CNNs are limited from capturing varying-scaled features and global contextual information due to the employment of fixed-sized kernels. In contrast, ViTs employ self-attention and MLP for global information modeling, but they lack mechanisms to learn spatial-wise local information. Additionally, self-attention leads the network to show high computational complexity. To tackle these limitations, we propose Progressively Entangled Transformer Large Kernel (PTLK) and Collaboratively Entangled Transformer Large Kernel (CTLK) modules to leverage the benefits of self-attention and large kernel convolutions and overcome shortcomings. Specifically, PTLK and CTLK modules employ the Multi-head Large Kernel to capture multi-scale local features and the Efficient Decomposed Self-attention to model global information efficiently. Subsequently, they employ the Attention Entanglement mechanism to enable local and global features to enhance and calibrate each other progressively and collaboratively. Additionally, an Attention-gated Channel MLP (AG-MLP) module is proposed to equip the standard MLP module with the capabilities of modeling spatial information. PTLK and CTLK modules are further incorporated as a Cross Entanglement Decoding (CED) block for efficient feature fusion and decoding. Finally, we propose a novel network for volumetric medical image segmentation that employs an encoder-decoder architecture, termed TransLK-Net. The encoder employs a hierarchical ViT architecture whose block is built by incorporating PTLK and CTLK with AG-MLP into a ViT block, and the decoder employs the CED block.

Title: OFDM-ISAC Beyond CP Limit: Performance Analysis and Mitigation Algorithms
Authors: Peishi Li, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is well-suited for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), yet its cyclic prefix (CP) is dimensioned for communications-grade multipath and is generally insufficient for sensing. When echoes exceed the CP duration, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) break subcarrier orthogonality and degrade sensing. This paper presents a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for OFDM-ISAC beyond the CP limit. We first develop a general echo model that explicitly captures the structured coupling of ISI and ICI caused by CP insufficiency. Building on this model, we derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the range-Doppler peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR), both of which are shown to deteriorate approximately linearly with the normalized excess delay beyond the CP. To mitigate these effects, we propose two standard-compatible successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods: SIC-DFT, a low-complexity DFT-based scheme, and SIC-ESPRIT, a super-resolution subspace approach. Simulations corroborate the analysis and demonstrate consistent gains over representative benchmarks. Both algorithms provide more than $4$dB SINR improvement under CP-insufficient conditions, while SIC-ESPRIT reduces range/velocity root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) by about one order of magnitude, approaching the performance achievable with a sufficiently long CP. These results offer both theoretical insight and practical solutions for reliable long-range OFDM-ISAC sensing beyond the CP limit.

Title: Machine Learning-based Online Stability Lobe Diagram Estimation and Chatter Suppression Control in Milling Process
Authors: Yi Huang, Feng Han, Wenyi Liu, Jingang Yi, Yuebin Guo
Abstract: Chatter is a self-excited vibration in milling that degrades surface quality and accelerates tool wear. This paper presents an adaptive process controller that suppresses chatter by leveraging machine learning-based online estimation of the Stability Lobe Diagram (SLD) and surface roughness in the process. Stability analysis is conducted using the semi-discretization method for milling dynamics modeled by delay differential equations. An integrated machine learning framework estimates the SLD from sensor data and predicts surface roughness for chatter detection in real time. These estimates are integrated into an optimal controller that adaptively adjusts spindle speed to maintain process stability and improve surface finish. Simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the superior performance compared to the existing approaches.

Title: Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator with Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Prior
Authors: Ziye Zhang, Bin Pan, Zhenwei Shi
Abstract: Spectral super-resolution (SSR) aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from multispectral observations, with broad applications in remote sensing. Data-driven methods are widely used, but they often overlook physical principles, leading to unrealistic spectra, particularly in atmosphere-affected bands. To address this challenge, we propose the Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SSRNO), which incorporates atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) prior into the data-driven procedure, yielding more physically consistent predictions. The proposed SSRNO framework consists of three stages: upsampling, reconstruction, and refinement. In the upsampling stage, we leverage prior information to expand the input multispectral image, producing a physically plausible hyperspectral estimate. Subsequently, we utilize a neural operator in the reconstruction stage to learn a continuous mapping across the spectral domain. Finally, the refinement stage imposes a hard constraint on the output HSI to eliminate color distortion. The upsampling and refinement stages are implemented via the proposed guidance matrix projection (GMP) method, and the reconstruction neural operator adopts U-shaped spectral-aware convolution (SAC) layers to capture multi-scale features. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate the optimality of the GMP method. With the neural operator and ART priors, SSRNO also achieves continuous spectral reconstruction and zero-shot extrapolation. Various experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Title: On the Performance of Dual-Antenna Repeater Assisted Bi-Static MIMO ISAC
Authors: Anubhab Chowdhury, Erik G. Larsson
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for target detection and downlink data transmission in a repeater-assisted bi-static integrated sensing and communication system. A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas.

Title: Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM) Modulation for High Mobility Communications
Authors: Chaoyuan Bai, Pingzhi Fan, Zhengchun Zhou, Zilong Liu
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-carrier modulation framework for high-mobility communication scenarios. Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity.

Title: Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MU-MIMO mmWave Systems with Direct Channel Links
Authors: Taihao Zhang, Zhendong Peng, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a three-stage unified channel estimation strategy for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with the existence of the direct channels, where the base station (BS), the users and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar array (UPA). The effectiveness of the developed three-stage strategy stems from the careful design of both the pilot signal sequence of the users and the vectors of RIS. Specifically, in Stage I, the cascaded channel components are eliminated by configuring the RIS phase shift vectors with a {\pi} difference to estimate the direct channels for all users. The orthogonal subspace projection is employed in Stage II to obtain equivalent signal matrices, enabling the estimation of angles of departure (AoDs) of the user-RIS channel for all users. In Stage III, we combine the signals of the time slots with the same pilots and project obtained measurement matrix to the orthogonal complement space of the component consisting of the portion of the direct channel, which removes the direct components and thus prevents error propagation from the direct channels to the cascaded channels. Then, we estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the RIS-BS channel and remaining parameters of the cascaded channel for all users by exploiting the sparsity and correlation in the obtained equivalent matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method yields better estimation performance than the existing methods.

Title: On the stability of event-based control with neuronal dynamics
Authors: Luke Eilers, Jonas Stapmanns, Catarina Dias, Jean-Pascal Pfister
Abstract: Event-based control, unlike analogue control, poses significant analytical challenges due to its hybrid dynamics. This work investigates the stability and inter-event time properties of a control-affine system under event-based impulsive control. The controller consists of multiple neuronal units with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics acting on a time-invariant, multiple-input multiple-output plant in closed loop. Both the plant state and the neuronal units exhibit discontinuities that cancel if combined linearly, enabling a direct correspondence between the event-based impulsive controller and a corresponding analogue controller. Leveraging this observation, we prove global practical stability of the event-based impulsive control system. In the general nonlinear case, we show that the event-based impulsive controller ensures global practical asymptotic stability if the analogue system is input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to specific disturbances. In the linear case, we further show global practical exponential stability if the analogue system is stable. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. The findings reveal a fundamental link between analogue and event-based impulsive control, providing new insights for the design of neuromorphic controllers.

Title: Diverse Instance Generation via Diffusion Models for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images
Authors: Yanxing Liu, Jiancheng Pan, Jianwei Yang, Tiancheng Chen, Peiling Zhou, Bingchen Zhang
Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel instances with only a limited number of labeled training samples, presenting a challenge that is particularly prominent in numerous remote sensing applications such as endangered species monitoring and disaster assessment. Existing FSOD methods for remote sensing images (RSIs) have achieved promising progress but remain constrained by the limited diversity of instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that can leverage a diffusion model pretrained on large-scale natural images to synthesize diverse remote sensing instances, thereby improving the performance of few-shot object detectors. Instead of directly synthesizing complete remote sensing images, we first generate instance-level slices via a specialized slice-to-slice module, and then embed these slices into full-scale imagery for enhanced data augmentation. To further adapt diffusion models for remote sensing scenarios, we develop a class-agnostic image inversion module that can invert remote sensing instance slices into semantic space. Additionally, we introduce contrastive loss to semantically align the synthesized images with their corresponding classes. Experimental results show that our method hasachieved an average performance improvement of 4.4% across multiple datasets and various approaches. Ablation experiments indicate that the elaborately designed inversion module can effectively enhance the performance of FSOD methods, and the semantic contrastive loss can further boost the performance.

Title: Sparse Kalman Identification for Partially Observable Systems via Adaptive Bayesian Learning
Authors: Jilan Mei, Tengjie Zheng, Lin Cheng, Shengping Gong, Xu Huang
Abstract: Sparse dynamics identification is an essential tool for discovering interpretable physical models and enabling efficient control in engineering systems. However, existing methods rely on batch learning with full historical data, limiting their applicability to real-time scenarios involving sequential and partially observable data. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an online Sparse Kalman Identification (SKI) method by integrating the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).

Title: Sparse Broad Learning System via Sequential Threshold Least-Squares for Nonlinear System Identification under Noise
Authors: Zijing Li
Abstract: The Broad Learning System (BLS) has gained significant attention for its computational efficiency and less network parameters compared to deep learning structures. However, the standard BLS relies on the pseudoinverse solution, which minimizes the mean square error with $L_2$-norm but lacks robustness against sensor noise and outliers common in industrial environments. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Sparse Broad Learning System (S-BLS) framework. Instead of the traditional ridge regression, we incorporate the Sequential Threshold Least-Squares (STLS) algorithm -- originally utilized in the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) -- into the output weight learning process of BLS. By iteratively thresholding small coefficients, the proposed method promotes sparsity in the output weights, effectively filtering out noise components while maintaining modeling accuracy. This approach falls under the category of sparse regression and is particularly suitable for noisy environments. Experimental results on a numerical nonlinear system and a noisy Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and achieves superior robustness compared to standard BLS.

Title: Real-Time Lane-Level Crash Detection on Freeways Using Sparse Telematics Data
Authors: Shixiao Liang, Chengyuan Ma, Pei Li, Haotian Shi, Jiaxi Liu, Hang Zhou, Keke Long, Bofeng Cao, Todd Szymkowski, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Real-time traffic crash detection is critical in intelligent transportation systems because traditional crash notifications often suffer delays and lack specific, lane-level location information, which can lead to safety risks and economic losses. This paper proposes a real-time, lane-level crash detection approach for freeways that only leverages sparse telematics trajectory data. In the offline stage, the historical trajectories are discretized into spatial cells using vector cross-product techniques, and then used to estimate a vehicle intention distribution and select an alert threshold by maximizing the F1-score based on official crash reports. In the online stage, incoming telematics records are mapped to these cells and scored for three modules: transition anomalies, speed deviations, and lateral maneuver risks, with scores accumulated into a cell-specific risk map. When any cell's risk exceeds the alert threshold, the system issues a prompt warning. Relying solely on telematics data, this real-time and low-cost solution is evaluated on a Wisconsin dataset and validated against official crash reports, achieving a 75% crash identification rate with accurate lane-level localization, an overall accuracy of 96%, an F1-score of 0.84, and a non-crash-to-crash misclassification rate of only 0.6%, while also detecting 13% of crashes more than 3 minutes before the recorded crash time.

Title: Optimizing the Driving Profile for Vehicle Mass Estimation
Authors: Le Wang, Jessica Ye, Michael Refors, Oscar Flärdh, Håkan Hjalmarsson
Abstract: Accurate mass estimation is essential for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous heavy-duty vehicles, particularly during transportation missions in unstructured environments such as mining sites, where vehicle mass can vary significantly due to loading and unloading. While prior work has recognized the importance of acceleration profiles for estimation accuracy, the systematic design of driving profiles during transport has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper presents a framework for designing driving profiles to support accurate mass estimation. Based on application-oriented input design, it aims to meet a user-defined accuracy constraint under three optimization objectives: minimum-time, minimum-distance, and maximum accuracy (within a fixed time). It allows time- and distance-dependent bounds on acceleration and velocity, and is based on a Newtonian vehicle dynamics model with actuator dynamics. The optimal profiles are obtained by solving concave optimization problems using a branch-and-bound method, with alternative rank-constrained and semi-definite relaxations also discussed. Theoretical analysis provides insights into the optimal profiles, including feasibility conditions, key ratios between velocity and acceleration bounds, and trade-offs between time- and distance-optimal solutions. The framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on a Scania truck with different payloads. Results show that the designed profiles are feasible and effective, enabling accurate mass estimation as part of normal transportation operations without requiring dedicated calibration runs. An additional contribution is a non-causal Wiener filter, with parameters estimated via the Empirical Bayes method, used to filter the accelerometer signal with no phase-lag.

Title: Energy Control Strategy to Enhance AC Fault Ride-Through in Offshore Wind MMC-HVDC Systems
Authors: Dileep Kumar, Wajiha Shireen
Abstract: Modular Multilevel Converter-based High Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) system is a promising technology for integration of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, onshore AC faults on MMC-HVDC reduce the power transfer capability of onshore converter station, leading to surplus power accumulation in HVDC link. This surplus power causes a rapid rise in DC-link voltage and may hinder safe operation of OWFs. To address such a situation, this paper presents an AC fault ride-through scheme that combines the storage of surplus power in MMC submodule (SM) capacitors and dissipation of residual power in an energy dissipation device (EDD). The proposed energy control facilitates use of half-bridge MMC SMs with low-capacitance, with their storage capacity leveraged to share the surplus power during faults, with a lower-rated EDD. The proposed scheme is tested on a 640kV/420MW MMC-HVDC system. The results show that proposed control scheme effectively maintains DC link voltages, ensuring connection of OWFs.

Title: Laboratory and field testing of a residential heat pump retrofit for a DC solar nanogrid
Authors: Aaron H.P. Farha, Jonathan P. Ore, Elias N. Pergantis, Davide Ziviani, Eckhard A. Groll, Kevin J. Kircher
Abstract: Residential buildings are increasingly integrating large devices that run natively on direct current (DC), such as solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and DC motors that drive heat pumps and other major appliances. Today, these natively-DC devices typically connect within buildings through alternating current (AC) distribution systems, entailing significant energy losses due to conversions between AC and DC. This paper investigates the alternative of connecting DC devices through DC distribution. Specifically, this paper shows through laboratory and field experiments that an off-the-shelf residential heat pump designed for conventional AC systems can be powered directly on DC with few hardware modifications and little change in performance. Supporting simulations of a DC nanogrid including historical heat pump and rest-of-house load measurements, a solar photovoltaic array, and a stationary battery suggest that connecting these devices through DC distribution could decrease annual electricity bills by 12.5% with an after-market AC-to-DC heat pump retrofit and by 16.7% with a heat pump designed to run on DC.

Title: CT-CFAR A Robust CFAR Detector Based on CLEAN and Truncated Statistics in Sidelobe-Contaminated Environments
Authors: Jiachen Zhu, Fangjiong Chen, Jie Wu, Ming Xia
Abstract: This paper proposes a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) target detection algorithm based on the CLEAN concept and truncated statistics to mitigate the non-homogeneity of reference samples caused by sidelobe contamination and other abnormal interferences within the reference window. The proposed algorithm employs truncated statistics to separate target and noise components in the radar echo power spectrum, thereby restoring the homogeneity assumption of the reference window. In addition, learnable historical sidelobe information is introduced to enhance the robustness and environmental adaptability of the detection process. Furthermore, based on multichannel echo data, a target reconstruction model that combines the Candan algorithm with least-squares estimation is established, incorporating the CLEAN concept to suppress sidelobe interference. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world measurement experiments demonstrate that the proposed CT-CFAR algorithm achieves high-precision target detection without requiring prior knowledge of abnormal samples. Compared with various CFAR algorithms, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of the reference window, accurately estimates the noise spectrum, and exhibits superior detection performance and computational efficiency in complex scenarios affected by sidelobe contamination.

Title: BeamCKM: A Framework of Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems
Authors: Haohan Wang, Xu Shi, Hengyu Zhang, Yashuai Cao, Sufang Yang, Jintao Wang, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: The channel knowledge map (CKM) enables efficient construction of high-fidelity mapping between spatial environments and channel parameters via electromagnetic information analysis. Nevertheless, existing studies are largely confined to single-antenna systems, failing to offer dedicated guidance for multi-antenna communication scenarios. To address the inherent conflict between traditional real-value pathloss map and multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) coherent beamforming in B5G/6G systems, this paper proposes a novel concept of BeamCKM and CKMTransUNet architecture. The CKMTransUNet approach combines a UNet backbone for multi-scale feature extraction with a vision transformer (ViT) module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors, utilizing a composite loss function to characterize the beam propagation characteristics. Furthermore, based on the CKMTransUNet backbone, this paper presents a methodology named M3ChanNet. It leverages the multi-modal learning technique and cross-attention mechanisms to extract intrinsic side information from environmental profiles and real-time multi-beam observations, thereby further improving the map construction accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) interpolation methods and deep learning (DL) approaches, delivering superior performance even when environmental contours are inaccurate.

Title: AutoMAS: A Generic Multi-Agent System for Algorithm Self-Adaptation in Wireless Networks
Authors: Dingli Yuan, Jingchen Peng, Jie Fan, Boxiang Ren, Lu Yang, Peng Liu
Abstract: The wireless communication environment has the characteristic of strong dynamics. Conventional wireless networks operate based on the static rules with predefined algorithms, lacking the self-adaptation ability. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides a possibility for wireless networks to become more intelligent and fully automated. As such, we plan to integrate the cognitive capability and high intelligence of the emerging AI agents into wireless networks. In this work, we propose AutoMAS, a generic multi-agent system which can autonomously select the most suitable wireless optimization algorithm according to the dynamic wireless environment. Our AutoMAS combines theoretically guaranteed wireless algorithms with agents' perception ability, thereby providing sounder solutions to complex tasks no matter how the environment changes. As an example, we conduct a case study on the classical channel estimation problem, where the mobile user moves in diverse environments with different channel propagation characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate that our AutoMAS can guarantee the highest accuracy in changing scenarios. Similarly, our AutoMAS can be generalized to autonomously handle various tasks in 6G wireless networks with high accuracy.

Authors: Mahmoud Ghazal, Nadhir Ben Rached, Tareq Al-Naffouri
Abstract: This paper explores the use of enhanced Monte-Carlo (MC) techniques to evaluate the outage probability of single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) systems under Rician fading, in which the input is combined using generalized selection combining with maximum ratio combining (GSC/MRC). The studied set of methods includes previously established methods: universal importance sampling (UIS) and multilevel splitting (MLS), alongside readapted methods: exponential twisting (ET) and cross-entropy (CE), and a novel method introduced here: partition importance sampling (PIS). Performance is assessed across standard efficiency metrics, revealing that ET, CE, and PIS exhibit the best performance. CE is found to be the most robust method among them.

Title: Joint Optimization for Security and Reliability in Round-Trip Transmissions for URLLC services
Authors: Xinyan Le, Yao Zhu, Yulin Hu, Bin Han
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is a potential solution for secure and reliable transmissions in future Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This work jointly optimizes redundant bits and blocklength allocation in practical round-trip transmission scenarios. To minimize the leakage-failure probability, a metric that jointly characterizes security and reliability in PLS, we formulate an optimization problem for allocating both redundant bits and blocklength. By deriving the boundaries of the feasible set, we obtain the globally optimal solution for this integer optimization problem. To achieve more computationally efficient solutions, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) method that exploits the partial convexity of the objective function. Subsequently, we develop a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm through convex approximation of the objective function, which further improves computational efficiency. Finally, we validate the performance of the three proposed approaches through simulations, demonstrating their practical applicability for future URLLC services.

Title: 6G Satellite Direct-to-Cell Connectivity: "To distribute, or not to distribute, that is the question"
Authors: Diego Tuzi, Thomas Delamotte, Andreas Knopp
Abstract: Direct-to-cell connectivity between satellites and common terrestrial handheld devices represents an essential feature of 6G. The industry is considering different type of constellations but using classical single satellite solutions based on phased array antennas. This article proposes to decompose a classical single satellite into a swarm of multiple small platforms (e.g. CubeSats) each equipped with one or a small number of radiating elements. The platforms are spaced far apart to create a large virtual aperture. The use of small satellites promises cost reduction for production and launch, while the distributed nature of the system introduces interesting features, such as scalability and fault tolerance. This perspective article provides insights into the opportunities and a discussion of the research challenges for the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Title: InstructAudio: Unified speech and music generation with natural language instruction
Authors: Chunyu Qiang, Kang Yin, Xiaopeng Wang, Yuzhe Liang, Jiahui Zhao, Ruibo Fu, Tianrui Wang, Cheng Gong, Chen Zhang, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation. Audio samples are available at: this https URL

Title: Shape-Adapting Gated Experts: Dynamic Expert Routing for Colonoscopic Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Gia Huy Thai, Hoang-Nguyen Vu, Anh-Minh Phan, Quang-Thinh Ly, Tram Dinh, Thi-Ngoc-Truc Nguyen, Nhat Ho
Abstract: The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.

Title: Dissipativity and L2 Stability of Large-Scale Networks with Changing Interconnections
Authors: Ingyu Jang, Leila J. Bridgeman
Abstract: In this paper, the L2 stability of switched networks is studied based on the QSR-dissipativity of each agent. While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.

Title: Beyond the Expiry Date: Uncovering Hidden Value in Functional Drink Waste for a Circular Future
Authors: Yiying He, Zhiqiang Zuo, Yianni Alissandratos, Penny Willson, Shameem Kazmi, Alex P. S. Brogan, Miao Guo
Abstract: Expired functional drinks have great valorisation potential due to the high concentration of organic molecules present. However, detailed information of the resources in these expired functional drinks is limited, hindering the rational design of a recovery system. To address this gap, we present here a study that comprehensively characterises the chemical composition of functional drinks and discus their potential use as feedstocks for biomethane production. The example functional drinks were abundant in sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, and were especially rich in glucose, fructose, and alanine. Our studies revealed that functional drinks with high COD values that corresponded to high proportions of sugar and organic acid and low proportions of sorbitol and amino acids could realise profitable recovery through anaerobic digestion, with a minimum biomethane yield of 11.72 mL CH4 / mL drink. To assess utility further we also examined the dynamic composition of functional drinks up to 16 weeks (at 4 °C) after expiration to capture the shift in resources during deterioration. In doing so, we identified 4 distinct periods of carbon resource variation: 1) chemically stable period, 2) sorbitol degradation period, 3) sugar degradation period, and 4) acidification period. Based on the time-course biomethane production experiments for expired functional drinks, the optimal operating time window for biomethane production from drinks without ascorbic acid would be after sorbitol degradation period in terms of its economic performance through convenient natural deterioration. Therefore, this comprehensive study on dynamic chemical composition in expired functional drinks and their biomethane production potential could facilitate a rational design of resource recovery system for soft drink field.

Title: Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)
Authors: Kooktae Lee, Ethan Brook
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance. This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations. Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.

Title: Autoencoder for Position-Assisted Beam Prediction in mmWave ISAC Systems
Authors: Ahmad A. Aziz El-Banna, Octavia A. Dobre
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication and millimeter wave (mmWave) have emerged as pivotal technologies for 6G networks. However, the narrow nature of mmWave beams requires precise alignments that typically necessitate large training overhead. This overhead can be reduced by incorporating the position information with beam adjustments. This letter proposes a lightweight autorencoder (LAE) model that addresses the position-assisted beam prediction problem while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to the conventional baseline method, i.e., deep fully connected neural network. The proposed LAE is designed as a three-layer undercomplete network to exploit its dimensionality reduction capabilities and thereby mitigate the computational requirements of the trained model. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a similar beam prediction accuracy to the baseline with an 83% complexity reduction.

Title: Leveraging Language Models for Interpretable Analysis of Narratives in a Large Corpus
Authors: Eric A. Bai, Minling Zhou, Ricardo Henao, Kyle M. Schwing, Lawrence Carin
Abstract: Narratives drive human behavior and lay at the core of geopolitics, but have eluded quantification that would permit measurement of their overlap and evolution. We present an interpretable model that integrates an established bag-of-words (BoW) topical representation and a novel LLM-based question answering (Q&A) narrative model, which share a latent Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space representation, to quantify written documents. Our approach mitigates the cost, interpretability, and generalization challenges of using a LLM to analyze large corpora without full inference. We derive efficient functional gradient descent updates that are interpretable and structurally analogous to the self-attention mechanism in Transformers. We further introduce an in-context Q&A extrapolation method inspired by Transformer architectures, enabling accurate prediction of Q&A outcomes for unqueried documents.

Abstract: This paper develops a new guidance law for powered descent landing of a rocket-powered vehicle. The proposed law derives the acceleration command for a point mass model of the vehicle by expressing velocity as a dynamical system undergoing supercritical transcritical bifurcation with three bifurcation parameters. The parameters are designed such that the stable equilibrium points of the velocity dynamics correspond to the guided targeting state, that is, the landing point. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the working of the proposed guidance law.

Title: Equivariant Deep Equilibrium Models for Imaging Inverse Problems
Authors: Alexander Mehta, Ruangrawee Kitichotkul, Vivek K Goyal, Julián Tachella
Abstract: Equivariant imaging (EI) enables training signal reconstruction models without requiring ground truth data by leveraging signal symmetries. Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) are a powerful class of neural networks where the output is a fixed point of a learned operator. However, training DEQs with complex EI losses requires implicit differentiation through fixed-point computations, whose implementation can be challenging. We show that backpropagation can be implemented modularly, simplifying training. Experiments demonstrate that DEQs trained with implicit differentiation outperform those trained with Jacobian-free backpropagation and other baseline methods. Additionally, we find evidence that EI-trained DEQs approximate the proximal map of an invariant prior.

Title: Evaluation of Hardware-based Video Encoders on Modern GPUs for UHD Live-Streaming
Authors: Kasidis Arunruangsirilert, Jiro Katto
Abstract: Many GPUs have incorporated hardware-accelerated video encoders, which allow video encoding tasks to be offloaded from the main CPU and provide higher power efficiency. Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated.

Title: LLM4AMC: Adapting Large Language Models for Adaptive Modulation and Coding
Authors: Xinyu Pan, Boxun Liu, Xiang Cheng, Chen Chen
Abstract: Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is a key technology in 5G new radio (NR), enabling dynamic link adaptation by balancing transmission efficiency and reliability based on channel conditions. However, traditional methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the aging issues of channel quality indicator (CQI). Recently, the emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in contextual understanding and temporal modeling naturally align with the dynamic channel adaptation requirements of AMC technology. Leveraging pretrained LLMs, we propose a channel quality prediction method empowered by LLMs to optimize AMC, termed LLM4AMC. We freeze most parameters of the LLM and fine-tune it to fully utilize the knowledge acquired during pretraining while better adapting it to the AMC task. We design a network architecture composed of four modules, a preprocessing layer, an embedding layer, a backbone network, and an output layer, effectively capturing the time-varying characteristics of channel quality to achieve accurate predictions of future channel conditions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves link performance and exhibits potential for practical deployment.

Title: Neural B-Frame Coding: Tackling Domain Shift Issues with Lightweight Online Motion Resolution Adaptation
Authors: Sang NguyenQuang, Xiem HoangVan, Wen-Hsiao Peng
Abstract: Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Title: First Deep Learning Approach to Hammering Acoustics for Stem Stability Assessment in Total Hip Arthroplasty
Authors: Dongqi Zhu, Zhuwen Xu, Youyuan Chen, Minghao Jin, Wan Zheng, Yi Zhou, Huiwu Li, Yongyun Chang, Feng Hong, Zanjing Zhai
Abstract: Audio event classification has recently emerged as a promising approach in medical applications. In total hip arthroplasty (THA), intra-operative hammering acoustics provide critical cues for assessing the initial stability of the femoral stem, yet variability due to femoral morphology, implant size, and surgical technique constrains conventional assessment methods. We propose the first deep learning framework for this task, employing a TimeMIL model trained on Log-Mel Spectrogram features and enhanced with pseudo-labeling. On intra-operative recordings, the method achieved 91.17 % +/- 2.79 % accuracy, demonstrating reliable estimation of stem stability. Comparative experiments further show that reducing the diversity of femoral stem brands improves model performance, although limited dataset size remains a bottleneck. These results establish deep learning-based audio event classification as a feasible approach for intra-operative stability assessment in THA.

Title: Near-Field Sparse Bayesian Channel Estimation and Tracking for XL-IRS-Aided Wideband mmWave Systems
Authors: Xiaokun Tuo, Zijian Chen, Ming-Min Zhao, Changsheng You, Min-Jian Zhao
Abstract: The rapid development of 6G systems demands advanced technologies to boost network capacity and spectral efficiency, particularly in the context of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. A key challenge here is obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), especially with extremely large IRS (XL-IRS), due to near-field propagation, high-dimensional wideband cascaded channels, and the passive nature of the XL-IRS. In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TS-CET framework significantly improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead as compared to existing benchmark methods.

Title: Accelerated Transformer Energization Sequence for Inverter Based Resources in Black-Start Procedures with Active Flux Trajectory Manipulation in the Stationary Reference Frame
Authors: Jiyu Lee, Shenghui Cui
Abstract: This paper proposes advanced soft-magnetization techniques to enable ultra-fast and reliable black-start of grid-forming (GFM) converters. Conventional hard-magnetization with well-established three-phase voltages during transformer energization induces severe inrush currents due to flux offset, which can damage power semiconductor devices. To overcome this drawback, an ultra-fast soft-magnetization method is firstly introduced, leveraging the voltage programmability of the inverter to actively reshape the initial voltage profile and thereby eliminate flux offset of the transformer core. By suppressing the formation of flux offset itself, the proposed approach prevents magnetic saturation and achieves nominal terminal voltage within a few milliseconds while effectively suppressing inrush current. However, this method can still trigger surge currents to power semiconductor devices in the presence of an LC filter due to abrupt voltage magnitude and phase transitions. To address this issue, an enhanced Archimedean spiral soft-magnetization method is developed, where both voltage magnitude and phase evolve smoothly to simultaneously suppress inrush and surge currents. Furthermore, residual flux in the transformer core is considered, and a demagnetization sequence using the inverter is validated to ensure reliable start-up. Experimental results confirm that the proposed methods achieve rapid black-start performance within one fundamental cycle while ensuring safe and stable operation of GFM converters.

Title: Equivariant Tracking Control for Fully Actuated Mechanical Systems on Matrix Lie Groups
Authors: Matthew Hampsey, Pieter van Goor, Ravi Banavar, Robert Mahony
Abstract: Mechanical control systems such as aerial, marine, space, and terrestrial robots often naturally admit a state-space that has the structure of a Lie group. The kinetic energy of such systems is commonly invariant to the induced action by the Lie group, and the system dynamics can be written as a coupled ordinary differential equation on the group and the dual space of its Lie algebra, termed a Lie-Poisson system. In this paper, we show that Lie-Poisson systems can also be written as a left-invariant system on a semi-direct Lie group structure placed on the trivialised cotangent bundle of the symmetry group. The authors do not know of a prior reference for this observation and we are confident the insight has never been exploited in the context of tracking control. We use this representation to build a right-invariant tracking error for the full state of a Lie-Poisson mechanical system and show that the error dynamics for this error are themselves of Lie-Poisson structure, albeit with time-varying inertia. This allows us to tackle the general trajectory tracking problem using an energy shaping design metholodology. To demonstrate the approach, we apply the proposed design methodology to a simple attitude tracking control.

Abstract: This paper proposes robust nonlinear transform coding (Robust-NTC), a generalizable digital joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework that couples variational latent modeling with channel adaptive transmission. Unlike learning-based JSCC methods that implicitly absorb channel variations, Robust-NTC explicitly models element-wise latent distributions via a variational objective with a Gaussian proxy for quantization and channel noise, allowing encoder-decoder to capture latent uncertainty without channel-specific training. Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions.

Title: Semi-Passive IRS Enabled Sensing with Group Movable Sensors
Authors: Qiaoyan Peng, Qingqing Wu, Wen Chen, Guangji Chen, Ying Gao, Lexi Xu, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: The performance of the sensing system is limited by the signal attenuation and the number of receiving components. In this letter, we investigate the sensor position selection in a semi-passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing system. The IRS consists of passive elements and active sensors, where the sensors can receive and process the echo signal for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. Motivated by the movable antenna array and fluid antenna system, we consider the case where the sensors are integrated into a group for movement and derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). Then, the optimal solution for the positions of the movable sensors (MSs) to the CRB minimization problem is derived in closed form. Moreover, we characterize the relationship between the CRB and system parameters. Theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MS scheme over the fixed-position (FP) scheme.

Title: Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Multi-Target Sensing: CRB Characterization and Optimization
Authors: Haobin Mao, Lipeng Zhu, Wenyan Ma, Zhenyu Xiao, Xiang-Gen Xia, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless communication and sensing performance towards sixth-generation (6G) networks through flexible antenna movement. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless sensing system based on MA arrays to enhance multi-target spatial angle estimation performance. We begin by characterizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement. The resultant low correlation of steering vectors over multiple targets' directions further helps mitigate angle estimation ambiguity and thus enhances MSE performance.

Title: Adaptive Probabilistic Constellation Shaping based on Enumerative Sphere Shaping for FSO Channel with Turbulence and Pointing Errors
Authors: Jingtian Liu, Xiongwei Yang, Yi Wei, Jianjun Yu, Feng Zhao
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) transmission enables fast, secure, and efficient next-generation communications with abundant spectrum resources. However, atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, path loss, and atmospheric loss induce random attenuation, challenging link reliability. Adaptive rate control technology enhances spectrum utilization and reliability. We propose an adaptive probabilistic constellation shaping (A-PCS) coherent system utilizing enumerated spherical shaping (ESS) for distribution matching. With PCS-64QAM, the system achieves continuous rate control from conventional QPSK-equivalent to 64QAM spectral efficiency, providing quasi-continuous control with granularities of approximately $0.05$~bits/4D for spectral efficiency and $0.1$~dB for the post-FEC SNR threshold, and a maximum control depth of $12.5$~dB. Leveraging ESS for efficient sequence utilization, it offers higher spectral utilization and finer control granularity than constant composition DM (CCDM)-based A-PCS systems. We further model and analyze the FSO channel, presenting calculations and comparisons of outage probability and ergodic capacity under varying turbulence intensities and pointing errors. Results demonstrate 99.999~\% reliability at maximum $\sigma_\mathrm{R}^2 = 1.39$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{s} = 0.5~\mathrm{m}$, meeting requirements under severe turbulence and large pointing errors.

Title: Large Language Model-Assisted Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure with Real-World Case Study
Authors: Xinda Zheng, Canchen Jiang, Hao Wang
Abstract: The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.

Title: Impact Analysis of COVID-19 in Bangladesh Power Sector and Recommendations based on Practical Data and Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Anis Ahmed, Arefin Ahamed Shuvo, Naruttam Kumar Roy, Neloy Prosad Bishnu, Ali Nasir
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the power sector in Bangladesh, how the country has dealt with it, and explores the path to stability. The study employs data visualisation and complex statistics to examine critical data about power systems in Bangladesh. This includes load patterns on a daily, monthly, annual, weekend, and weekday basis. Significant alterations in these patterns have been observed during our study e.g., in April and May of 2020, the power demand decreased by approximately 15.4% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. We have used a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to predict the load profile of 2020 excluding COVID-19 effects. This model is compared with the actual load profile to determine the degree to which COVID-19 has impacted. The comparison indicates that the average power demand decreased by approximately 19.5% in April 2020 and 18.3% in May 2020, relative to its projected value. The study also investigates system stability by analyzing transmission loss and load factor, and the environmental effect by analyzing the Carbon Dioxide emission rate. Finally, the study provides recommendations for overcoming future disasters, such as developing more resilient power systems, investing in renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency.

Title: PolyOCP.jl -- A Julia Package for Stochastic OCPs and MPC
Authors: Ruchuan Ou, Learta Januzi, Jonas Schießl, Michael Heinrich Baumann, Lars Grüne, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: The consideration of stochastic uncertainty in optimal and predictive control is a well-explored topic. Recently Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) have seen a lot of considerations for problems involving stochastically uncertain system parameters and also for problems with additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances. While there exist a number of open-source PCE toolboxes, tailored open-source codes for the solution of OCPs involving additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances in julia are not available. Hence, this paper introduces the toolbox this http URL which enables to efficiently solve stochastic OCPs for a large class of disturbance distributions. We explain the main mathematical concepts between the PCE transcription of stochastic OCPs and how they are provided in the toolbox. We draw upon two examples to illustrate the functionalities of this http URL.

Title: Optimal policy design for innovation diffusion: shaping today's incentives for transforming the future
Authors: Lisa Piccinin, Valentina Breschi, Chiara Ravazzi, Fabrizio Dabbene, Mara Tanelli
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for the design of incentives aimed at promoting innovation diffusion in social influence networks. In particular, our framework relies on an extension of the Friedkin and Johnsen opinion dynamics model characterizing the effects of (i) short-memory incentives, which have an immediate yet transient impact, and (ii) long-term structural incentives, whose impact persists via an exponentially decaying memory. We propose to design these incentives via a model-predictive control (MPC) scheme over an augmented state that captures the memory in our opinion dynamics model, yielding a convex quadratic program with linear constraints. Our numerical simulations based on data on sustainable mobility habits show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which balances large-scale adoption and resource allocation

Title: Data-driven certificates of constraint enforcement and stability for unmodeled, discrete dynamical systems using tree data structures
Authors: Amy K. Strong, Ali Kashani, Claus Danielson, Leila J. Bridgeman
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of developing data-driven certificates for the stability and safety of unmodeled dynamical systems by leveraging a tree data structure and an upper bound of the system's Lipschitz constant. Previously, an invariant set was synthesized by iteratively expanding an initial invariant set. In contrast, this work iteratively prunes the constraint set to synthesize an invariant set -- eliminating the need for a known, initial invariant set. Furthermore, we provide stability assurances by characterizing the asymptotic stability of the system relative to an invariant approximation of the minimal positive invariant set through synthesis of a discontinuous piecewise affine Lyapunov function over the computed invariant set. The proposed method takes inspiration from subdivision techniques and requires no prior system knowledge beyond Lipschitz continuity.

Title: Innovative Modular Design and Kinematic Approach based on Screw Theory for Triple Scissors Links Deployable Space Antenna Mechanism
Authors: Mamoon Aamir, Mariyam Sattar, Naveed Ur Rehman Junejo, Aqsa Zafar Abbasi
Abstract: This paper presents the geometry design and analysis of a novel triple scissors links deployable antenna mechanism (TSDAM) to deal with the problems of large aperture and high precision space antennas for deep space communication and Earth observation. This mechanism has only one degree of freedom (DoF) and thus makes for efficient and reliable deployment without loss of structural integrity. It employed a systematic design approach starting from a triple scissors links modular unit to a 25m aperture assembly. Different configurations constituting variable numbers of modular units were analyzed in SolidWorks to identify the deployable mechanism with lowest deformation. While the 24 units configuration offered superior stowage compactness, it exhibited higher deformation (0.01437mm), confirming the 12 units configuration as the optimal balance between structural stability and deployment efficiency. Screw theory was employed to analyze the kinematic properties, and numerical simulations were performed in MATLAB and SolidWorks. The deployable space antenna showed transition from stowed to fully deployed state in just 53 seconds with high stability throughout the deployment process. The TSDAM attained a storage ratio of up to 15.3 for height and volume with 0.01048mm of deformation for a 12 units configuration. Mesh convergence analysis proved the consistency of the simulation results for 415314 tetrahedral shaped elements. The virtual experiments in SolidWorks verified the analytical Screw theory based model and ensured that the design was smooth and flexible for deployment in operational conditions. The research establishes a robust design framework for future deployable antennas, offering enhanced performance, simplified structure, and improved reliability

Title: Development of a Transit-Time Ultrasonic Flow Measurement System for Partially Filled Pipes: Incorporating Flow Profile Correction Factor and Real-Time Clogging Detection
Authors: Mohammadhadi Mesmarian, Mohammad Mahdi Kharidar, Hossein Nejat Pishkenari
Abstract: Flow measurement in partially filled pipes presents greater complexity compared to fully filled systems, primarily due to the complex velocity distribution within the cross-section, which is a key source of measurement inaccuracy. To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action.

Title: Secure Beamforming Design for IRS-ISAC Systems with a Hardware-Efficient Hybrid Beamforming Architecture
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Zhenglan Zhao, Jingran Lin, Zhiling Xiao, Qiang Li
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HB) architecture to achieve balanced performance in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. We consider a scenario where a multi-antenna, dual-function base station (BS) performs secure beamforming for a multi-antenna legitimate receiver while simultaneously detecting potential targets. Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-ISAC system with HB architecture in balancing performance and hardware costs.

Title: Secure Analog Beamforming for Multi-user MISO Systems with Movable Antennas
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Jingran Lin, Kai Zhong, Liu Yang, Hongli Liu, Qiang Li, Cunhua Pan
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) represent a novel approach that enables flexible adjustments to antenna positions, effectively altering the channel environment and thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs.

Title: Connectivity-Aware Task Offloading for Remote Northern Regions: a Hybrid LEO-MEO Architecture
Authors: Mohammed Almekhlafi, Antoine Lesage-Landry, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: Arctic regions, such as northern Canada, face significant challenges in achieving consistent connectivity and low-latency computing services due to the sparse coverage of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. To enhance service reliability in remote areas, this paper proposes a hybrid satellite architecture for task offloading that combines Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and LEO satellites. We develop an optimization framework to maximize task offloading admission rate while balancing the energy consumption and delay requirements. Accounting for satellite visibility and limited computing resources, our approach integrates dynamic path selection with frequency and computational resource allocation. Because the formulated problem is NP-hard, we reformulate it into a mixed-integer convex form using disjunctive constraints and convex relaxation techniques, enabling efficient use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Simulation results show that, compared to a standalone LEO network, the proposed hybrid LEO-MEO architecture improves the task admission rate by 15\% and reduces the average delay by 12\%. These findings highlight the architecture's potential to enhance connectivity and user experience in remote Arctic areas.

Title: A Hybrid Learning-to-Optimize Framework for Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming
Authors: Viet-Anh Le, Mu Xie, Rahul Mangharam
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a learning-to-optimize (L2O) framework to accelerate solving parametric mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problems, with a particular focus on mixed-integer model predictive control (MI-MPC) applications. The framework learns to predict integer solutions with enhanced optimality and feasibility by integrating supervised learning (for optimality), self-supervised learning (for feasibility), and a differentiable quadratic programming (QP) layer, resulting in a hybrid L2O framework. Specifically, a neural network (NN) is used to learn the mapping from problem parameters to optimal integer solutions, while a differentiable QP layer is integrated to compute the corresponding continuous variables given the predicted integers and problem parameters. Moreover, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which combines a supervised loss with respect to the global optimal solution, and a self-supervised loss derived from the problem's objective and constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two benchmark MI-MPC problems, with comparative results against purely supervised and self-supervised learning models.

Title: Data driven synthesis of provable invariant sets via stochastically sampled data
Authors: Amy K. Strong, Ali Kashani, Claus Danielson, Leila Bridgeman
Abstract: Positive invariant (PI) sets are essential for ensuring safety, i.e. constraint adherence, of dynamical systems. With the increasing availability of sampled data from complex (and often unmodeled) systems, it is advantageous to leverage these data sets for PI set synthesis. This paper uses data driven geometric conditions of invariance to synthesize PI sets from data. Where previous data driven, set-based approaches to PI set synthesis used deterministic sampling schemes, this work instead synthesizes PI sets from any pre-collected data sets. Beyond a data set and Lipschitz continuity, no additional information about the system is needed. A tree data structure is used to partition the space and select samples used to construct the PI set, while Lipschitz continuity is used to provide deterministic guarantees of invariance. Finally, probabilistic bounds are given on the number of samples needed for the algorithm to determine of a certain volume.

Title: Saving Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems
Authors: Yuxiang Wan, Ryan Devera, Wenjie Zhang, Ju Sun
Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

Title: AI- and Ontology-Based Enhancements to FMEA for Advanced Systems Engineering: Current Developments and Future Directions
Authors: Haytham Younus, Sohag Kabir, Felician Campean, Pascal Bonnaud, David Delaux
Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.

Title: REXO: Indoor Multi-View Radar Object Detection via 3D Bounding Box Diffusion
Authors: Ryoma Yataka, Pu Perry Wang, Petros Boufounos, Ryuhei Takahashi
Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

Title: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Resource Allocation in Uplink Carrier Aggregation in the Presence of Self Interference
Authors: Jaswanth Bodempudi, Batta Siva Sairam, Madepalli Haritha, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam
Abstract: Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.

Title: The Hydraulic Brain: Understanding as Constraint-Release Phase Transition in Whole-Body Resonance
Authors: Ahmed Gamal Eldin
Abstract: Current models treat physiological signals as noise corrupting neural computation. Previously, we showed that removing these "artifacts" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition. Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs. Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics. Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence. Keywords: embodied cognition, phase transitions, Granger causality, thermodynamics, neuromorphic computing, resonance dynamics, EEG artifacts

Title: Anti-Jamming based on Null-Steering Antennas and Intelligent UAV Swarm Behavior
Authors: Miguel Lourenço, António Grilo
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms represent a key advancement in autonomous systems, enabling coordinated missions through inter-UAV communication. However, their reliance on wireless links makes them vulnerable to jamming, which can disrupt coordination and mission success. This work investigates whether a UAV swarm can effectively overcome jamming while maintaining communication and mission efficiency. To address this, a unified optimization framework combining Genetic Algorithms (GA), Supervised Learning (SL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. The mission model, structured into epochs and timeslots, allows dynamic path planning, antenna orientation, and swarm formation while progressively enforcing collision rules. Null-steering antennas enhance resilience by directing antenna nulls toward interference sources. Results show that the GA achieved stable, collision-free trajectories but with high computational cost. SL models replicated GA-based configurations but struggled to generalize under dynamic or constrained settings. RL, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrated adaptability and real-time decision-making with consistent communication and lower computational demand. Additionally, the Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion to arbitrary directions through a rotation-based mechanism, validating the scalability of the proposed system. Overall, UAV swarms equipped with null-steering antennas and guided by intelligent optimization algorithms effectively mitigate jamming while maintaining communication stability, formation cohesion, and collision safety. The proposed framework establishes a unified, flexible, and reproducible basis for future research on resilient swarm communication systems.

Title: APULSE: A Scalable Hybrid Algorithm for the RCSPP on Large-Scale Dense Graphs
Authors: Nuno Soares, António Grilo
Abstract: The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.

Title: Weakly-supervised Latent Models for Task-specific Visual-Language Control
Authors: Xian Yeow Lee, Lasitha Vidyaratne, Gregory Sin, Ahmed Farahat, Chetan Gupta
Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.

Title: Explicit Bounds on the Hausdorff Distance for Truncated mRPI Sets via Norm-Dependent Contraction Rates
Authors: Jiaxun Sun
Abstract: This paper establishes the first explicit and closed-form upper bound on the Hausdorff distance between the truncated minimal robust positively invariant (mRPI) set and its infinite-horizon limit. While existing mRPI approximations guarantee asymptotic convergence through geometric or norm-based arguments, none provides a computable expression that quantifies the truncation error for a given horizon. We show that the error satisfies \( d_H(\mathcal{E}_N,\mathcal{E}_\infty) \le r_W\,\gamma^{N+1}/(1-\gamma), \) where $\gamma<1$ is the induced-norm contraction factor and $r_W$ depends only on the disturbance set. The bound is fully analytic, requires no iterative set computations, and directly characterizes the decay rate of the truncated Minkowski series. We further demonstrate that the choice of vector norm serves as a design parameter that accelerates convergence, enabling substantially tighter horizon selection for robust invariant-set computations and tube-based MPC. Numerical experiments validate the sharpness, scalability, and practical relevance of the proposed bound.

Title: On Linear Convergence of Distributed Stochastic Bilevel Optimization over Undirected Networks via Gradient Aggregation
Authors: Ajay Tak, Mayank Baranwal
Abstract: Many large-scale constrained optimization problems can be formulated as bilevel distributed optimization tasks over undirected networks, where agents collaborate to minimize a global cost function while adhering to constraints, relying only on local communication and computation. In this work, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient aggregation scheme and establish its linear convergence under the weak assumption of global strong convexity, which relaxes the common requirement of local function convexity on the objective and constraint functions. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate when the global objective function (and not each local objective function) satisfies strong-convexity. Our results significantly extend existing theoretical guarantees for distributed bilevel optimization. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on distributed sensor network problems and distributed linear regression with rank-deficient data.

Title: Aspiration-based Perturbed Learning Automata in Games with Noisy Utility Measurements. Part B: Stochastic Stability in Weakly Acyclic Games
Authors: Georgios C. Chasparis
Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning dynamics may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.

Title: Expanding the Workspace of Electromagnetic Navigation Systems Using Dynamic Feedback for Single- and Multi-agent Control
Authors: Jasan Zughaibi, Denis von Arx, Maurus Derungs, Florian Heemeyer, Luca A. Antonelli, Quentin Boehler, Michael Muehlebach, Bradley J. Nelson
Abstract: Electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) enable a number of magnetically guided surgical procedures. A challenge in magnetically manipulating surgical tools is that the effective workspace of an eMNS is often severely constrained by power and thermal limits. We show that system-level control design significantly expands this workspace by reducing the currents needed to achieve a desired motion. We identified five key system approaches that enable this expansion: (i) motion-centric torque/force objectives, (ii) energy-optimal current allocation, (iii) real-time pose estimation, (iv) dynamic feedback, and (v) high-bandwidth eMNS components. As a result, we stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum on an eight-coil OctoMag eMNS with significantly lower currents (0.1-0.2 A vs. 8-14 A), by replacing a field-centric field-alignment strategy with a motion-centric torque/force-based approach. We generalize to multi-agent control by simultaneously stabilizing two inverted pendulums within a shared workspace, exploiting magnetic-field nonlinearity and coil redundancy for independent actuation. A structured analysis compares the electromagnetic workspaces of both paradigms and examines current-allocation strategies that map motion objectives to coil currents. Cross-platform evaluation of the clinically oriented Navion eMNS further demonstrates substantial workspace expansion by maintaining stable balancing at distances up to 50 cm from the coils. The results demonstrate that feedback is a practical path to scalable, efficient, and clinically relevant magnetic manipulation.

Title: Online Smoothed Demand Management
Authors: Adam Lechowicz, Nicolas Christianson, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Adam Wierman, Prashant Shenoy
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $\Delta_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \& aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.

Title: Physically Informed Bayesian Retrieval of SWE and Snow Depth in Forested Areas from Airborne X And Ku-Band SAR Measurements
Authors: Siddharth Singh, Carrie Vuyovich, Ana P. Barros
Abstract: This study presents a coupled physical statistical framework for retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) in forested areas using dual frequency X and Ku band SAR observations. The method combines a multilayer snow hydrology model (MSHM) with microwave propagation and backscatter models, and includes a canopy parameterization based on a modified Water Cloud Model that accounts for canopy closure. The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively. Retrievals at 30 m resolution for one flight further reduce spatial errors and increase the fraction of low error pixels by about 78% at a 10% absolute error threshold, demonstrating the feasibility of dual frequency Bayesian SWE retrievals in forested landscapes by combining physical modeling with SAR observations.

Title: Generative Myopia: Why Diffusion Models Fail at Structure
Authors: Milad Siami
Abstract: Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).

Title: Performance Evaluation of Dual RIS-Assisted Received Space Shift Keying Modulation
Authors: Ferhat Bayar, Haci Ilhan, Erdogan Aydin
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are gaining traction for their ability to reshape wireless environments with low energy consumption. However, prior studies primarily explore single-RIS deployments with static or semi-static reflection control. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-RIS-assisted architecture for smart indoor wireless signal routing, wherein the second RIS (RIS$_2$) is dynamically configured based on source data bits to steer signals toward specific receivers or indoor zones. The first RIS (RIS$_1$), positioned near a fed antenna or access point, passively reflects the incident signal. RIS$_2$, equipped with a lightweight controller, performs bit-driven spatial modulation to enable data-dependent direction selection at the physical layer. We develop a complete end-to-end system model, including multi-hop channel representation, RIS phase configuration mapping, and signal detection based on space shift keying (SSK). Performance analysis is evaluated in terms of achievable capacity and outage probability under varying inter-RIS distances and carrier frequencies.

Title: Data Augmentation Strategies for Robust Lane Marking Detection
Authors: Flora Lian, Dinh Quang Huynh, Hector Penades, J. Stephany Berrio Perez, Mao Shan, Stewart Worrall
Abstract: Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model. By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario.

Title: Evaluation of Real-Time Mitigation Techniques for Cyber Security in IEC 61850 / IEC 62351 Substations
Authors: Akila Herath, Chen-Ching Liu, Junho Hong, Kuchan Park
Abstract: The digitalization of substations enlarges the cyber-attack surface, necessitating effective detection and mitigation of cyber attacks in digital substations. While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication. The study also identifies limitations that none of the techniques can fully address, highlighting areas for future work.

Title: PrismAudio: Decomposed Chain-of-Thoughts and Multi-dimensional Rewards for Video-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Huadai Liu, Kaicheng Luo, Wen Wang, Qian Chen, Peiwen Sun, Rongjie Huang, Xiangang Li, Jieping Ye, Wei Xue
Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

Title: Multidimensional Music Aesthetic Evaluation via Semantically Consistent C-Mixup Augmentation
Authors: Shuyang Liu, Yuan Jin, Rui Lin, Shizhe Chen, Junyu Dai, Tao Jiang
Abstract: Evaluating the aesthetic quality of generated songs is challenging due to the multi-dimensional nature of musical perception. We propose a robust music aesthetic evaluation framework that combines (1) multi-source multi-scale feature extraction to obtain complementary segment- and track-level representations, (2) a hierarchical audio augmentation strategy to enrich training data, and (3) a hybrid training objective that integrates regression and ranking losses for accurate scoring and reliable top-song identification. Experiments on the ICASSP 2026 SongEval benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across correlation and top-tier metrics.

Title: On the Tail Transition of First Arrival Position Channels: From Cauchy to Exponential Decay
Authors: Yen-Chi Lee
Abstract: While the zero-drift First Arrival Position (FAP) channel is rigorously known to be Cauchy-distributed, practical molecular communication systems typically operate with non-zero drift. This letter characterizes the transition from heavy-tailed Cauchy behavior to light-tailed exponential decay. Through asymptotic analysis, we identify a critical spatial scale $n_c=\sigma^2/v$ separating diffusion- and drift-dominated regimes, revealing that the channel effectively behaves as a ``Truncated Cauchy'' model. Numerical results show that Gaussian approximations severely underestimate capacity at low drift, while the zero-drift case provides the appropriate performance lower bound for systems where drift assists particle transport.

Title: Directional Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Runxin Zhang, Yulin Shao, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: We propose a directional pinching-antenna system (DiPASS), a comprehensive framework that transitions PASS modeling from idealized abstraction to physical consistency. DiPASS introduces the first channel model that accurately captures the directional, pencil-like radiation of pinching antennas, incorporates a practical waveguide attenuation of 1.3 dB/m, and accounts for stochastic line-of-sight blockage. A key enabler of DiPASS is our new "equal quota division" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks.

Title: Decarbonization pathways for liquid fuels: A multi-sector energy system perspective
Authors: Jun Wen Law, Bryan K. Mignone, Dharik S. Mallapragada
Abstract: Low-carbon liquid fuels play a key role in energy system decarbonization scenarios. This study uses a multi-sector capacity expansion model of the contiguous United States to examine fuels production in deeply decarbonized energy systems. Our analysis evaluates how the shares of biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquid fuels change under varying assumptions about resource constraints (biomass and CO2 sequestration availability), fuel demand distributions, and supply flexibility to produce different fuel products. Across all scenarios examined, biofuels provide a substantial share of liquid fuel supply, while synthetic fuels deploy only when biomass or CO2 sequestration is assumed to be more limited. Fossil liquid fuels remain in all scenarios examined, primarily driven by the extent to which their emissions can be offset with removals. Limiting biomass increases biogenic CO2 capture within biofuel pathways, while limiting sequestration availability increases the share of captured atmospheric (including biogenic) carbon directed toward utilization for synthetic fuel production. While varying assumptions about liquid fuel demand distributions and fuel product supply flexibility alter competition among individual fuel production technologies, broader energy system outcomes are robust to these assumptions. Biomass and CO2 sequestration availability are key drivers of energy system outcomes in deeply decarbonized energy systems.

Title: Reference-Free Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control
Authors: Fabian Schramm, Pierre Fabre, Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert, Justin Carpentier
Abstract: We present a sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) framework that enables emergent locomotion without relying on handcrafted gait patterns or predefined contact sequences. Our method discovers diverse motion patterns, ranging from trotting to galloping, robust standing policies, jumping, and handstand balancing, purely through the optimization of high-level objectives. Building on model predictive path integral (MPPI), we propose a dual-space spline parameterization that operates on position and velocity control points. Our approach enables contact-making and contact-breaking strategies that adapt automatically to task requirements, requiring only a limited number of sampled trajectories. This sample efficiency allows us to achieve real-time control on standard CPU hardware, eliminating the need for GPU acceleration typically required by other state-of-the-art MPPI methods. We validate our approach on the Go2 quadrupedal robot, demonstrating various emergent gaits and basic jumping capabilities. In simulation, we further showcase more complex behaviors, such as backflips, dynamic handstand balancing and locomotion on a Humanoid, all without requiring reference tracking or offline pre-training.

Title: Dynamic Multi-Species Bird Soundscape Generation with Acoustic Patterning and 3D Spatialization
Authors: Ellie L. Zhang, Duoduo Liao, Callie C. Liao
Abstract: Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.

Title: Dynamic Leader-Follower Consensus with Adversaries: A Multi-Hop Relay Approach
Authors: Liwei Yuan, Hideaki Ishii
Abstract: This paper examines resilient dynamic leader-follower consensus within multi-agent systems, where agents share first-order or second-order dynamics. The aim is to develop distributed protocols enabling nonfaulty/normal followers to accurately track a dynamic/time-varying reference value of the leader while they may receive misinformation from adversarial neighbors. Our methodologies employ the mean subsequence reduced algorithm with agents engaging with neighbors using multi-hop communication. We accordingly derive a necessary and sufficient graph condition for our algorithms to succeed; also, our tracking error bounds are smaller than that of the existing method. Furthermore, it is emphasized that even when agents do not use relays, our condition is tighter than the sufficient conditions in the literature. With multi-hop relays, we can further obtain more relaxed graph requirements. Finally, we present numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.

Title: Nonlinear MPC for Feedback-Interconnected Systems: a Suboptimal and Reduced-Order Model Approach
Authors: Stefano Di Gregorio, Guido Carnevale, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a suboptimal and reduced-order Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture for discrete-time feedback-interconnected systems. The numerical MPC solver: (i) acts suboptimally, performing only a finite number of optimization iterations at each sampling instant, and (ii) relies only on a reduced-order model that neglects part of the system dynamics, either due to unmodeled effects or the presence of a low-level compensator. We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled. The theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on a mechatronic system consisting of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor.

Title: Learning to Admit Optimally in an $M/M/k/k+N$ Queueing System with Unknown Service Rate
Authors: Saghar Adler, Mehrdad Moharrami, Vijay Subramanian
Abstract: Motivated by applications of the Erlang-B blocking model and the extended $M/M/k/k+N$ model that allows for some queueing, beyond communication networks to sizing and pricing in production, messaging, and app-based parking systems, we study admission control for such systems with unknown service rate. In our model, a dispatcher either admits every arrival into the system (when there is room) or blocks it. Every served job yields a fixed reward but incurs a per unit time holding cost which includes the waiting time in the queue to get service if there is any. We aim to design a dispatching policy that maximizes the long-term average reward by observing arrival times and system state at arrivals, a realistic decision-event driven sampling of such systems. The dispatcher observes neither service times nor departure epochs, which excludes the use of reward-based reinforcement learning approaches. We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learning problem a'la self-tuning adaptive control. In our problem, certainty equivalent control switches between always admit if room (explore infinitely often), and never admit (terminate learning), so at judiciously chosen times we avoid the never admit recommendation. We prove that our proposed policy asymptotically converges to the optimal policy and present finite-time regret guarantees. The extreme contrast in the control policies shows up in our regret bounds for different parameter regimes: constant in one versus logarithmic in another.

Title: Automatic nodule identification and differentiation in ultrasound videos to facilitate per-nodule examination
Authors: Siyuan Jiang, Yan Ding, Yuling Wang, Lei Xu, Wenli Dai, Wanru Chang, Jianfeng Zhang, Jie Yu, Jianqiao Zhou, Chunquan Zhang, Ping Liang, Dexing Kong
Abstract: Ultrasound is a vital diagnostic technique in health screening, with the advantages of non-invasive, cost-effective, and radiation free, and therefore is widely applied in the diagnosis of nodules. However, it relies heavily on the expertise and clinical experience of the sonographer. In ultrasound images, a single nodule might present heterogeneous appearances in different cross-sectional views which makes it hard to perform per-nodule examination. Sonographers usually discriminate different nodules by examining the nodule features and the surrounding structures like gland and duct, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. To address this problem, we collected hundreds of breast ultrasound videos and built a nodule reidentification system that consists of two parts: an extractor based on the deep learning model that can extract feature vectors from the input video clips and a real-time clustering algorithm that automatically groups feature vectors by nodules. The system obtains satisfactory results and exhibits the capability to differentiate ultrasound videos. As far as we know, it's the first attempt to apply re-identification technique in the ultrasonic field.

Title: MHE under parametric uncertainty -- Robust state estimation without informative data
Authors: Simon Muntwiler, Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: In this paper, we study joint state and parameter estimation for general nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters and persistent process and measurement noise. In particular, we are interested in stability properties of the resulting state estimate in the absence of persistency of excitation (PE). With a simple academic example, we show that existing moving horizon estimation (MHE) approaches for joint state and parameter estimation as well as classical adaptive observers can result in diverging state estimates in the absence of PE, even if the noise is small. We propose an MHE formulation involving a regularization based on a constant prior estimate of the unknown system parameters. Only assuming the existence of a stable state estimator, we prove that the proposed MHE approach results in practically robustly stable state estimates irrespective of PE. We discuss the relation of the proposed MHE formulation to state-of-the-art results from MHE and adaptive estimation. The properties of the proposed MHE approach are illustrated with a numerical example of a car with unknown tire friction parameters.

Title: How improving performance may imply losing consistency in event-triggered consensus
Authors: David Meister, Duarte J. Antunes, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Event-triggered control is often argued to lower the average triggering rate compared to time-triggered control while still achieving a desired control goal, e.g., the same performance level. However, this property, often called consistency, cannot be taken for granted and can be hard to analyze in many settings. In particular, the performance properties of decentralized event-triggered control schemes with respect to time-triggered control remain mostly unexplored. Therefore, in this paper, we examine these performance properties for a consensus problem considering single-integrator agent dynamics, a level-triggering rule, and a complete communication graph. We consider the long-term average quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. For this setting, we show that enriching the information the local controllers use improves the performance of the consensus algorithm but renders a previously consistent event-triggered control scheme inconsistent. In addition, we do so while deploying optimal control inputs which we derive for both information cases and triggering schemes. With this insight, we can furthermore explain the relationship between two seemingly contrasting consistency results from the literature.

Title: Self-Refined Generative Foundation Models for Wireless Traffic Prediction
Authors: Chengming Hu, Hao Zhou, Di Wu, Xi Chen, Jun Yan, Xue Liu
Abstract: With a broad range of emerging applications in 6G networks, wireless traffic prediction has become a critical component of network management. However, the dynamically shifting distribution of wireless traffic in non-stationary 6G networks presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and stable predictions. Motivated by recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI)-enabled 6G networks, this paper proposes a novel self-refined Large Language Model (LLM) for wireless traffic prediction, namely TrafficLLM, through in-context learning without parameter fine-tuning or model training. The proposed TrafficLLM harnesses the powerful few-shot learning abilities of LLMs to enhance the scalability of traffic prediction in dynamically changing wireless environments. Specifically, our proposed TrafficLLM embraces an LLM to iteratively refine its predictions through a three-step process: traffic prediction, feedback generation, and prediction refinement. Initially, the proposed TrafficLLM conducts traffic predictions using task-specific demonstration prompts. Recognizing that LLMs may generate incorrect predictions on the first attempt, this paper designs feedback demonstration prompts to provide multifaceted and valuable feedback related to these initial predictions. The validation scheme is further incorporated to systematically enhance the accuracy of mathematical calculations during the feedback generation process. Following this comprehensive feedback, our proposed TrafficLLM introduces refinement demonstration prompts, enabling the same LLM to further refine its predictions and thereby enhance prediction performance. Evaluations on two realistic datasets demonstrate that the proposed TrafficLLM outperforms LLM-based in-context learning methods, achieving performance improvements of 23.17% and 17.09%, respectively.

Title: FCDM: A Physics-Guided Bidirectional Frequency Aware Convolution and Diffusion-Based Model for Sinogram Inpainting
Authors: Jiaze E, Srutarshi Banerjee, Tekin Bicer, Guannan Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Bin Ren
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in scientific imaging systems such as synchrotron and laboratory-based nano-CT, but acquiring full-view sinograms requires high radiation dose and long scan times. Sparse-view CT alleviates this burden but yields incomplete sinograms with structured signal loss, hampering accurate reconstruction. Unlike RGB images, sinograms encode overlapping features along projection paths and exhibit distinct directional spectral patterns, which make conventional RGB-oriented inpainting approaches--including diffusion models--ineffective for sinogram restoration, as they disregard the angular dependencies and physical constraints inherent to tomographic data. To overcome these limitations, we propose FCDM, a diffusion-based framework tailored for sinograms, which restores global structure through bidirectional frequency reasoning and angular-aware masking, while enforcing physical plausibility via physics-guided constraints and frequency-adaptive noise control. Experiments on real-world datasets show that FCDM consistently outperforms baselines, achieving SSIM over 0.93 and PSNR above 31 dB across diverse sparse-view scenarios.

Title: RN-SDEs: Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction with Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations
Authors: Jiaqi Guo, Santiago Lopez-Tapia, Wing Shun Li, Yunan Wu, Marcelo Carignano, Martin Kröger, Vinayak P. Dravid, Igal Szleifer, Vadim Backman, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Abstract: Computed tomography is a widely used imaging modality with applications ranging from medical imaging to material analysis. One major challenge arises from the lack of scanning information at certain angles, resulting in distortion or artifacts in the reconstructed images. This is referred to as the Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) reconstruction problem. To address this problem, we propose the use of Residual Null-Space Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equations (RN-SDEs), which are a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion process with mean-reverting (MR) stochastic differential equations. To demonstrate the generalizability of RN-SDEs, we conducted experiments with two different LACT datasets, ChromSTEM and C4KC-KiTS. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that by leveraging learned MR-SDEs as a prior and emphasizing data consistency using Range-Null Space Decomposition (RNSD) based rectification, we can recover high-quality images from severely degraded ones and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most LACT tasks. Additionally, we present a quantitative comparison of RN-SDE with other networks, in terms of computational complexity and runtime efficiency, highlighting the superior effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Abstract: We present SALAD, a zero-shot TTS autoregressive model operating over continuous speech representations. SALAD utilizes a per-token diffusion process to refine and predict continuous representations for the next time step. We compare our approach against a discrete variant of SALAD as well as publicly available zero-shot TTS systems, and conduct a comprehensive analysis of discrete versus continuous modeling techniques. Our results show that SALAD achieves superior intelligibility while matching the speech quality and speaker similarity of ground-truth audio.

Title: Confined Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Sparse Random Combinatorial Matrices
Authors: Xinwei Zhao, Jinming Wen, Hongqi Yang, Xiao Ma
Abstract: Orthogonal matching pursuit~(OMP) is a commonly used greedy algorithm for recovering sparse signals from compressed measurements. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the OMP algorithm to reduce the complexity of reconstructing a class of $K$-sparse signals $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ from measurements $\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}$. In particular, $\boldsymbol{A} \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ is a sparse random combinatorial matrix with independent columns, where each column is chosen uniformly among the vectors with exactly $d~(d \leq m/2)$ ones. The proposed algorithm, referred to as the confined OMP algorithm, leverages the properties of the sparse signal $\boldsymbol{x}$ and the measurement matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ to reduce redundancy in $\boldsymbol{A}$, thereby requiring fewer column indices to be identified. To this end, we first define a confined set $\Gamma$ with $|\Gamma| \leq n$ and then prove that the support of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ with probability 1 if the distributions of nonzero components of $\boldsymbol{x}$ satisfy a certain condition. During the process of the confined OMP algorithm, the possibly chosen column indices are strictly confined to the confined set $\Gamma$. We further develop the lower bound on the probability of exact recovery of $\boldsymbol{x}$ using the confined OMP algorithm. Furthermore, the obtained theoretical results can be used to optimize the column degree $d$ of $\boldsymbol{A}$. Finally, experimental results show that the confined OMP algorithm is more efficient in reconstructing a class of sparse signals compared to the OMP algorithm.

Title: Full-scale Representation Guided Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation
Authors: Sunyong Seo, Sangwook Yoo, Huisu Yoon
Abstract: The U-Net architecture and its variants have remained state-of-the-art (SOTA) for retinal vessel segmentation over the past decade. In this study, we introduce a Full-Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where a novel feature representation module using modernized convolution blocks effectively captures full-scale structural information, while a guided convolution block subsequently refines this information. Specifically, we introduce an attention-guided filter within the guided convolution block, leveraging its similarity to unsharp masking to enhance fine vascular structures. Passing full-scale information to the attention block facilitates the generation of more contextually relevant attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, providing further refinement to the segmentation performance. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, ensuring flexibility and scalability across various segmentation tasks. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its compact architecture, FSG-Net delivers performance competitive with SOTA methods across multiple public datasets. Ablation studies further demonstrate that each proposed component meaningfully contributes to this competitive performance. Our code is available on this https URL.

Authors: Mu Jia, Junting Chen, Ying-Chang Liang, Pooi-Yuen Kam
Abstract: Constant-envelope signals are widely used in mobile edge applications and wireless communication systems for their hardware-friendly design, energy efficiency, and reliability. However, reliable detection with simple, power-efficient receivers remains challenging. Coherent methods offer superior performance but require complex synchronization, increasing complexity and power use. Noncoherent detection is simpler, avoiding synchronization, but traditional approaches rely on in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) demodulators for signal magnitudes and assume energy detectors without theoretical justification. This paper proposes a framework for optimal detection using a bandpass-filter envelope-detector (BFED) with Bayes criterion and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) under unknown amplitudes. Using modified Bessel function approximations, we show the optimal detector shifts based on SNR: in the low-SNR regime, we rigorously prove for the first time that the well-known energy detector (ED) is the Bayesian-optimal solution, thus providing a firm theoretical foundation for its widespread use; in high-SNR regimes, a novel amplitude detector (AD) compares estimated amplitude to noise deviation, leading to a simple yet optimal detection strategy. For unknown SNR, a reliability-based intelligent decision (RID) rule adaptively selects detectors, leveraging their strengths across SNR ranges. Simulations confirm energy and amplitude detectors minimize errors in their domains, with RID providing robust gains. The proposed framework provides a rigorous theoretical foundation and enables low-complexity implementations for resource-constrained, interference-limited mobile edge applications, including wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

Title: Neural Identification of Feedback-Stabilized Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Mahrokh G. Boroujeni, Laura Meroi, Leonardo Massai, Clara L. Galimberti, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate
Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems. However, identifying these systems from closed-loop experimental data remains a challenge due to the correlations induced by the feedback loop. Traditional nonlinear closed-loop system identification methods struggle with reliance on precise noise models, robustness to data variations, or computational feasibility. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the identified model is stabilized by the same controller used during data collection, ensuring alignment with the true system's closed-loop behavior. The dual Youla parameterization provides a promising solution for linear systems, offering statistical guarantees and closed-loop stability. However, extending this approach to nonlinear systems presents additional complexities. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable framework for identifying complex, potentially unstable systems while ensuring closed-loop stability using a complete parameterization of systems stabilized by a given controller. We establish asymptotic consistency in the linear case and validate our method through numerical comparisons, demonstrating superior accuracy over direct identification baselines and compatibility with the true system in stability properties.

Title: Markov Potential Game Construction and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Autonomous Driving
Authors: Huiwen Yan, Mushuang Liu
Abstract: Markov games (MGs) provide a mathematical foundation for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling self-interested agents to learn their optimal policies while interacting with others in a shared environment. However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to construct MPGs has remained open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.

Title: Smooth optimization using global and local low-rank regularizers
Authors: Rodrigo A. Lobos, Javier Salazar Cavazos, Raj Rao Nadakuditi, Jeffrey A. Fessler
Abstract: Many inverse problems and signal processing problems involve low-rank regularizers based on the nuclear norm. Commonly, proximal gradient methods (PGM) are adopted to solve this type of non-smooth problems as they can offer fast and guaranteed convergence. However, PGM methods cannot be simply applied in settings where low-rank models are imposed locally on overlapping patches; therefore, heuristic approaches have been proposed that lack convergence guarantees. In this work we propose to replace the nuclear norm with a smooth approximation in which a Huber-type function is applied to each singular value. By providing a theoretical framework based on singular value function theory, we show that important properties can be established for the proposed regularizer, such as: convexity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Moreover, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularizer gradient, enabling the use of standard iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradient) that can easily address the case of overlapping patches and have well-known convergence guarantees. In addition, we provide a novel step-size selection strategy based on a quadratic majorizer of the line-search function that leverages the Huber characteristics of the proposed regularizer. Finally, we assess the proposed optimization framework by providing empirical results in dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction in the context of local low-rank models with overlapping patches.

Title: Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites
Authors: Tong Ding, Luca Venturino, Emanuele Grossi
Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration, henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.

Title: Exploring the Near and Far-Field Coexistence for RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems: An Adaptive Bandwidth Splitting Approach
Authors: Seonghoon Yoo, Jaemin Jung, Seongah Jeong, Jinkyu Kang, Markku Juntti, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables the joint use of spectrum and hardware resources for radar sensing and data transmission, serving as a key enabler of next-generation wireless networks. However, most existing ISAC studies have been limited to operation within a single frequency band and have not been designed to adapt to diverse wireless propagation environments or user configurations. To address these limitations, this paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system employing an adaptive bandwidth-splitting strategy under near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) coexistence. The system comprises a full-duplex access point (AP), an RIS and multiple users, where an ISAC user (IU) is both a sensing target and a communication user in the NF region, while communication-only users (CUs) rely on the RIS and experience either NF or FF propagation depending on their placement. The proposed system jointly exploits traditional sensing-only (SO) and ISAC bands and adopts uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for simultaneous transmission. We formulate a joint optimization problem for the receive beamforming vector, bandwidth-splitting ratio, and RIS phase shifts to minimize the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) under rate and resource constraints. An efficient algorithm is developed based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework combined with semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional schemes that operate solely in either the ISAC or SO band, achieving superior performance across various RIS and user configurations under hybrid NF and FF coexistence scenarios.

Title: Warm Chat: Diffuse Emotion-aware Interactive Talking Head Avatar with Tree-Structured Guidance
Authors: Haijie Yang, Zhenyu Zhang, Hao Tang, Jianjun Qian, Jian Yang
Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose Warm Chat, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.

Title: Certifying the Nonexistence of Feasible Path Between Power System Operating Points
Authors: Mohammad Rasoul Narimani, Katherine R. Davis, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: By providing the optimal operating point that satisfies both the power flow equations and engineering limits, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is central to power systems operations. While extensive research has focused on computing high-quality OPF solutions, assessing the feasibility of transitioning between operating points remains challenging since the feasible spaces of OPF problems may consist of multiple disconnected components. It is not possible to transition between operating points in different disconnected components without violating OPF constraints. To identify such situations, this paper introduces an algorithm for certifying the infeasibility of transitioning between two operating points within an OPF feasible space. As an indication of potential disconnectedness, the algorithm first seeks an infeasible point on the line connecting a pair of feasible points. The algorithm then certifies disconnectedness by using convex relaxation and bound tightening techniques to show that all points on the plane that is normal to this line are infeasible. Using this algorithm, we provide the first certifications of disconnected feasible spaces for a variety of OPF test cases.

Title: Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey

Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However, unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing, computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management, providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.

Title: The First Open-Source Framework for Learning Stability Certificates from Data
Authors: Zhe Shen
Abstract: Before 2025, no open-source system existed that could learn Lyapunov stability certificates directly from noisy, real-world flight data. This work addresses that gap by proposing a data-driven approach that learns Lyapunov functions from trajectory data under realistic, noise-corrupted conditions. Unlike statistical anomaly detectors that only flag deviations, the proposed method assesses whether the system can still be certified as stable. Applied to public data from the 2024 SAS severe turbulence incident, this framework revealed that, within 60 seconds of the aircraft's descent becoming abnormal, no Lyapunov function could be constructed to certify system stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first application of a data-driven Lyapunov-based stability verification method to real civil aviation data, achieved without any access to proprietary controller logic. The proposed framework is open-sourced and available at: this https URL

Title: Revealing Chaotic Dependence and Degree-Structure Mechanisms in Optimal Pinning Control of Complex Networks
Authors: Qingyang Liu (1), Tianlong Fan (1), Liming Pan (1), Linyuan Lü (1) ((1) University of Science and Technology of China)
Abstract: Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here, leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines. Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex systems.

Title: Covert Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication System in Clutter Environment
Authors: Xuyang Zhao, Jiangtao Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Yongchao Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects. To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.

Title: Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics
Authors: Ilija Tanasković, Ljiljana B. Lazarević, Goran Knežević, Nikola Milosavljević, Olga Dubljević, Bojana Bjegojević, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. Proposed complementary analyses indicate that the individuality is primarily encoded in the QRS features across all four domains. BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude and slope, providing supportive, but less stable, discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation can be traced to stable inter-individual differences in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry. The potential in the clinical environment, particularly for systems in which patient identification depends on robust physiology-based markers.

Title: Soft Switching Expert Policies for Controlling Systems with Uncertain Parameters
Authors: Junya Ikemoto
Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While simulators are useful to safely synthesize control policies for physical systems using reinforcement learning, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Title: Fair Rate Maximization for Multi-User Multi-Cell MISO Communication Systems via Novel Transmissive RIS Transceiver
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Zhendong Li, Kunlun Wang, Hongying Tang, Jun Li
Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver configuration. Within this system framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming of the TRIS transceiver, subject to the power constraints of each TRIS transceiver unit. Since the objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear superiority of the deployment of the TRIS transceiver over the benchmark schemes.

Title: Millimeter-Scale Absolute Carrier Phase-Based Localization in Multi-Band Systems
Authors: Andrea Bedin, Joerg Widmer, Melanny Davila, Marco Canil, Rafael Ruiz
Abstract: Localization is a key feature of future Sixth Generation (6G) net-works with foreseen accuracy requirements down to the millimeter level, to enable novel applications in the fields of telesurgery, high-precision manufacturing, and others. Currently, such accuracy requirements are only achievable with specialized or highly resource-demanding systems, rendering them impractical for more wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we present the first system that enables low-complexity and low-bandwidth absolute 3D localization with millimeter-level accuracy in generic wireless networks. It performs a carrier phase-based wireless localization refinement of an initial location estimate based on successive location-likelihood optimization across multiple bands. Unlike previous phase unwrapping methods, our solution is one-shot. We evaluate its performance collecting ~350, 000 measurements, showing an improvement of more than one order of magnitude over classical localization techniques. Finally, we will open-source the low-cost, modular FR3 front-end that we developed for the experimental campaign.

Title: SPASHT: An image-enhancement method for sparse-view MPI SPECT
Authors: Zezhang Yang, Zitong Yu, Nuri Choi, Janice Tania, Wenxuan Xue, Barry A. Siegel, Abhinav K. Jha
Abstract: Single-photon emission computed tomography for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI SPECT) is a widely used diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease. However, the procedure requires considerable scanning time, leading to patient discomfort and the potential for motion-induced artifacts. Reducing the number of projection views while keeping the time per view unchanged provides a mechanism to shorten the scanning time. However, this approach leads to increased sampling artifacts, higher noise, and hence limited image quality. To address these issues, we propose sparseview SPECT image enhancement (SPASHT), inherently training the algorithm to improve performance on defect-detection tasks. We objectively evaluated SPASHT on the clinical task of detecting perfusion defects in a retrospective clinical study using data from patients who underwent MPI SPECT, where the defects were clinically realistic and synthetically inserted. The study was conducted for different numbers of fewer projection views, including 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 of the typical projection views for MPI SPECT. Performance on the detection task was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Images obtained with SPASHT yielded significantly improved AUC compared to those obtained with the sparse-view protocol for all the considered numbers of fewer projection views. To further assess performance, a human observer study on the task of detecting perfusion defects was conducted. Results from the human observer study showed improved detection performance with images reconstructed using SPASHT compared to those from the sparse-view protocol. The results provide evidence of the efficacy of SPASHT in improving the quality of sparse-view MPI SPECT images and motivate further clinical validation.

Title: Beamforming for Transmissive RIS Transceiver Enabled Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems
Authors: Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Yanze Zhu, Zhendong Li, Qiong Wu, Kunlun Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with multiple information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) users. Under the considered system model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the sum-rate of all ID users via the design of the TRIS transceiver's active beamforming. The design is constrained by per-antenna power limits at the TRIS transceiver and by the minimum harvested energy demand of all EH users. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and the energy harvesting constraint, the sum-rate problem is difficult to tackle. To solve this challenging optimization problem, by leveraging the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework and the majorization-minimization (MM) method, we propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based algorithm. Per-element power constraints introduce a large number of constraints, making the problem considerably more difficult. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method, we successfully develop an analytical, computationally efficient, and highly parallelizable algorithm to address this challenge. Numerical results are provided to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the low-complexity algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity without performance degradation.

Title: Smooth Total variation Regularization for Interference Detection and Elimination (STRIDE) for MRI
Authors: Alexander Mertens, Diego Martinez, Amgad Louka, Ying Yang, Chad Harris, Ian Connell
Abstract: MRI is increasingly desired to function near electronic devices that emit potentially dynamic electromagnetic interference (EMI). To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.

Title: Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech
Authors: Moran Yanuka, Paul Dixon, Eyal Finkelshtein, Daniel Rotman, Raja Giryes
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.

Authors: Chin-Yun Yu, György Fazekas
Abstract: We introduce a general formulation for automatic differentiation through direct form filters, yielding a closed-form backpropagation that includes initial condition gradients. The result is a single expression that can represent both the filter and its gradients computation while supporting parallelism. C++/CUDA implementations in PyTorch achieve at least 1000x speedup over naive Python implementations and consistently run fastest on the GPU. For the low-order filters commonly used in practice, exact time-domain filtering with analytical gradients outperforms the frequency-domain method in terms of speed.

Title: Secure Analog Beamforming Design for Wireless Communication Systems With Movable Antennas
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Kai Zhong, Zhiling Xiao, Jingran Lin, Qiang Li
Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) are a novel technology that allows for the flexible adjustment of antenna positions within a specified region, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the use of MA to improve physical layer security in an analog beamforming (AB) communication system. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit AB and MA position, subject to constant modulus (CM) constraints on the AB and position constraints for the MA. The resulting problem is non-convex, and we propose a penalty product manifold (PPM) method to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we convert the inequality constraints related to MA position into a penalty function using smoothing techniques, thereby reformulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization on the product manifold space (PMS). We then derive a parallel conjugate gradient descent (PCGD) algorithm to update both the AB and MA position on the PMS. This method is efficient, providing an analytical solution at each step and ensuring convergence to a KKT point. Simulation results show that the MA system achieves a higher secrecy rate than systems with fixed-position antennas.

Title: Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Eliya Badr, Hussein Sibai
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.

Title: A Review of Machine Learning for Cavitation Intensity Recognition in Complex Industrial Systems
Authors: Yu Sha, Ningtao Liu, Haofeng Liu, Junqi Tao, Zhenxing Niu, Guojun Huang, Yao Yao, Jiaqi Liang, Moxian Qian, Horst Stoecker, Domagoj Vnucec, Andreas Widl, Kai Zhou
Abstract: Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for detecting and evaluating cavitation phenomena in hydraulic machinery, with significant implications for operational safety, performance optimization, and maintenance cost reduction in complex industrial systems. Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis in complex industrial systems.

Title: OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation
Authors: Qi Jiang, Xiaolong Qian, Yao Gao, Lei Sun, Kailun Yang, Zhonghua Yi, Wenyong Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Luc Van Gool, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Abstract: Smart cities will be characterized by a variety of intelligent and networked services, each with specific requirements for the underlying network infrastructure. While smart city architectures and services have been studied extensively, little attention has been paid to the network technology. The KIGLIS research project, consisting of a consortium of companies, universities and research institutions, focuses on artificial intelligence for optimizing fiber-optic networks of a smart city, with a special focus on future mobility applications, such as automated driving. In this paper, we present early results on our process of collecting smart city requirements for communication networks, which will lead towards reference infrastructure and architecture solutions. Finally, we suggest directions in which artificial intelligence will improve smart city networks.

Title: Compressing Sensor Data for Remote Assistance of Autonomous Vehicles using Deep Generative Models
Authors: Daniel Bogdoll, Johannes Jestram, Jonas Rauch, Christin Scheib, Moritz Wittig, J. Marius Zöllner
Abstract: In the foreseeable future, autonomous vehicles will require human assistance in situations they can not resolve on their own. In such scenarios, remote assistance from a human can provide the required input for the vehicle to continue its operation. Typical sensors used in autonomous vehicles include camera and lidar sensors. Due to the massive volume of sensor data that must be sent in real-time, highly efficient data compression is elementary to prevent an overload of network infrastructure. Sensor data compression using deep generative neural networks has been shown to outperform traditional compression approaches for both image and lidar data, regarding compression rate as well as reconstruction quality. However, there is a lack of research about the performance of generative-neural-network-based compression algorithms for remote assistance. In order to gain insights into the feasibility of deep generative models for usage in remote assistance, we evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms regarding their applicability and identify potential weaknesses. Further, we implement an online pipeline for processing sensor data and demonstrate its performance for remote assistance using the CARLA simulator.

Title: Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model for Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting
Authors: Van-Duc Le, Tien-Cuong Bui, Sang-Kyun Cha
Abstract: Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting tries to precisely predict the air quality multiple hours ahead for the entire city. This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.

Title: PhiBE: A PDE-based Bellman Equation for Continuous Time Policy Evaluation
Authors: Yuhua Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we study policy evaluation in continuous-time reinforcement learning, where the state follows an unknown stochastic differential equation (SDE) but only discrete-time data are available. We first highlight that the discrete-time Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function because it ignores the underlying continuous-time structure. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth SDE structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification. In contrast to existing RL analyses that diverges as the sampling interval shrinks, the approximation error of PhiBE remains remains well-conditioned and independent of the discretization step by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.

Title: Barycentric rational approximation for learning the index of a dynamical system from limited data
Authors: Davide Pradovera, Ion Victor Gosea, Jan Heiland
Abstract: We consider the task of data-driven identification of dynamical systems, specifically for systems whose behavior at large frequencies is non-standard, as encoded by a non-trivial relative degree of the transfer function or, alternatively, a non-trivial index of a corresponding realization as a descriptor system. We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.

Title: Improvement of Spiking Neural Network with Bit Planes and Color Models
Authors: Nhan T. Luu, Duong T. Luu, Nam N. Pham, Thang C. Truong
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.

Title: Generative AI-Powered Plugin for Robust Federated Learning in Heterogeneous IoT Networks
Authors: Youngjoon Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization methods that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. The key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.

Title: Splats in Splats: Robust and Effective 3D Steganography towards Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Yijia Guo, Wenkai Huang, Yang Li, Gaolei Li, Hang Zhang, Liwen Hu, Jianhua Li, Tiejun Huang, Lei Ma
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive 3D reconstruction performance with explicit scene representations. Given the widespread application of 3DGS in 3D reconstruction and generation tasks, there is an urgent need to protect the copyright of 3DGS assets. However, existing copyright protection techniques for 3DGS overlook the usability of 3D assets, posing challenges for practical deployment. Here we describe splats in splats, the first 3DGS steganography framework that embeds 3D content in 3DGS itself without modifying any attributes. To achieve this, we take a deep insight into spherical harmonics (SH) and devise an importance-graded SH coefficient encryption strategy to embed the hidden SH coefficients. Furthermore, we employ a convolutional autoencoder to establish a mapping between the original Gaussian primitives' opacity and the hidden Gaussian primitives' opacity. Extensive experiments indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing 3D steganography techniques, with 5.31% higher scene fidelity and 3x faster rendering speed, while ensuring security, robustness, and user experience.

Title: Continuous Gaussian Process Pre-Optimization for Asynchronous Event-Inertial Odometry
Authors: Zhixiang Wang, Xudong Li, Yizhai Zhang, Fan Zhang, Panfeng Huang
Abstract: Event cameras, as bio-inspired sensors, are asynchronously triggered with high-temporal resolution compared to intensity cameras. Recent work has focused on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process (TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.

Title: Unrolled Creative Adversarial Network For Generating Novel Musical Pieces
Authors: Pratik Nag
Abstract: Music generation has emerged as a significant topic in artificial intelligence and machine learning. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely employed for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks (GANs) remain relatively underexplored in this domain. This paper presents two systems based on adversarial networks for music generation. The first system learns a set of music pieces without differentiating between styles, while the second system focuses on learning and deviating from specific composers' styles to create innovative music. By extending the Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) framework to the music domain, this work introduces unrolled CAN to address mode collapse, evaluating both GAN and CAN in terms of creativity and variation.

Title: RGBSQGrasp: Inferring Local Superquadric Primitives from Single RGB Image for Graspability-Aware Bin Picking
Authors: Yifeng Xu, Fan Zhu, Ye Li, Sebastian Ren, Xiaonan Huang, Yuhao Chen
Abstract: Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.

Title: Distributionally Robust Free Energy Principle for Decision-Making
Authors: Allahkaram Shafiei, Hozefa Jesawada, Karl Friston, Giovanni Russo
Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.

Title: Differentiable Simulator for Electrically Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures
Authors: Johannes Müller, Dennis Philipp, Matthias Günther
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel CUDA-enabled PyTorch-based framework designed for the gradient-based optimization of such reconfigurable electromagnetic structures with electrically tunable parameters. Traditional optimization techniques for these structures often rely on non-gradient-based methods, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Our framework leverages automatic differentiation, facilitating the application of gradient-based optimization methods. This approach is particularly advantageous for embedding within deep learning frameworks, enabling sophisticated optimization strategies. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations involving resonant structures with tunable parameters. Key contributions include the efficient solution of the inverse problem. The framework's performance is validated using three different resonant structures: a single-loop copper wire (Unit-Cell) as well as an 8x1 and an 8x8 array of resonant unit cells with multiple inductively coupled unit cells (1d and 2d Metasurfaces). Results show precise in-silico control over the magnetic field's component normal to the surface of each resonant structure, achieving desired field strengths with minimal error. The proposed framework is compatible with existing simulation software. This PyTorch-based framework sets the stage for advanced electromagnetic control strategies for resonant structures with application in e.g. MRI, providing a robust platform for further exploration and innovation in the design and optimization of resonant electromagnetic structures.

Title: Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication
Authors: Weixuan Chen, Qianqian Yang, Shuo Shao, Zhiguo Shi, Jiming Chen, Xuemin (Sherman)Shen
Abstract: As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain reliability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge, which may be part of the training set of the SemCom system, between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into a digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding based on the shared index of Y2, while the eavesdropper's decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves security comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.

Title: Learning to Drive Anywhere with Model-Based Reannotation
Authors: Noriaki Hirose, Lydia Ignatova, Kyle Stachowicz, Catherine Glossop, Sergey Levine, Dhruv Shah
Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents, validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.

Title: On the Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient-Tracking with Finite-Time Consensus
Authors: Aaron Fainman, Stefan Vlaski
Abstract: Algorithms for decentralized optimization and learning rely on local optimization steps coupled with combination steps over a graph. Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieves finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm. Our results hold for any periodic sequence of combination matrices. We clarify the interplay between approximation error of the finite-time consensus sequence and the length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.

Title: B2LoRa: Boosting LoRa Transmission for Satellite-IoT Systems with Blind Coherent Combining
Authors: Yimin Zhao, Weibo Wang, Xiong Wang, Linghe Kong, Jiadi Yu, Yifei Zhu, Shiyuan Li, Chong He, Guihai Chen
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, satellite-IoT systems using the LoRa technique have been increasingly deployed to provide widespread Internet services to low-power and low-cost ground devices. However, the long transmission distance and adverse environments from IoT satellites to ground devices pose a huge challenge to link reliability, as evidenced by the measurement results based on our real-world setup. In this paper, we propose a blind coherent combining design named B2LoRa to boost LoRa transmission performance. The intuition behind B2LoRa is to leverage the repeated broadcasting mechanism inherent in satellite-IoT systems to achieve coherent combining under the low-power and low-cost constraints, where each re-transmission at different times is regarded as the same packet transmitted from different antenna elements within an antenna array. Then, the problem is translated into aligning these packets at a fine granularity despite the time, frequency, and phase offsets between packets in the case of frequent packet loss. To overcome this challenge, we present three designs - joint packet sniffing, frequency shift alignment, and phase drift mitigation to deal with ultra-low SNRs and Doppler shifts featured in satellite-IoT systems, respectively. Finally, experiment results based on our real-world deployments demonstrate the high efficiency of B2LoRa.

Title: Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing
Authors: Satvik Dixit, Sungjoon Park, Chris Donahue, Laurie M. Heller
Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs.

Title: BemaGANv2: A Tutorial and Comparative Survey of GAN-based Vocoders for Long-Term Audio Generation
Authors: Taesoo Park, Mungwi Jeong, Mingyu Park, Narae Kim, Junyoung Kim, Mujung Kim, Jisang Yoo, Hoyun Lee, Sanghoon Kim, Soonchul Kwon
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GANbased vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Long-term audio generation is critical for applications in Text-to-Music (TTM) and Text-to-Audio (TTA) systems, where maintaining temporal coherence, prosodic consistency, and harmonic structure over extended durations remains a significant challenge. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including Multi-Scale Discriminator (MSD) + MED, MSD + MRD, and Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD)) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are available at: this https URL.

Title: Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models
Authors: Brennen A. Hill, Mant Koh En Wei, Thangavel Jishnuanandh
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Title: Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cramér Distance
Authors: Uwe D. Hanebeck
Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cramér distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

Title: Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable Sensor Data
Authors: Jaya Narain, Zakaria Aldeneh, Shirley Ren
Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.

Title: Intraoperative 2D/3D Registration via Spherical Similarity Learning and Differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization
Authors: Minheng Chen, Youyong Kong
Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.

Title: CommonVoice-SpeechRE and RPG-MoGe: Advancing Speech Relation Extraction with a New Dataset and Multi-Order Generative Framework
Authors: Jinzhong Ning, Paerhati Tulajiang, Yingying Le, Yijia Zhang, Yuanyuan Sun, Hongfei Lin, Haifeng Liu
Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech. Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research. Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an effective solution for real-world SpeechRE.

Title: Forecasting-based Biomedical Time-series Data Synthesis for Open Data and Robust AI
Authors: Youngjoon Lee, Seongmin Cho, Yehhyun Jo, Jinu Gong, Hyunjoo Jenny Lee, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. While GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models capture global data distributions, forecasting models offer inductive biases tailored for sequential dynamics. We propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based on recent forecasting models that accurately replicates complex electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These synthetic datasets can be freely shared for open AI development and consistently improve downstream model performance. Numerical results on sleep-stage classification show up to a 3.71\% performance gain with augmentation and a 91.00\% synthetic-only accuracy that surpasses the real-data-only baseline.

Title: Metaplectic time-frequency representations
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.

Title: Audio Palette: A Diffusion Transformer with Multi-Signal Conditioning for Controllable Foley Synthesis
Authors: Junnuo Wang
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled high-quality text-to-audio synthesis, but fine-grained acoustic control remains a significant challenge in open-source research. We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more artist-centric workflow.

Title: FoleyBench: A Benchmark For Video-to-Audio Models
Authors: Satvik Dixit, Koichi Saito, Zhi Zhong, Yuki Mitsufuji, Chris Donahue
Abstract: Video-to-audio generation (V2A) is of increasing importance in domains such as film post-production, AR/VR, and sound design, particularly for the creation of Foley sound effects synchronized with on-screen actions. Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes. We benchmark several state-of-the-art V2A models, evaluating them on audio quality, audio-video alignment, temporal synchronization, and audio-text consistency.
