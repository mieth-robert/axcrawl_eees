Title: Illuminating the Path: Attention-Assisted Beamforming and Predictive Insights in 5G NR Systems
Authors: Dino Pjanić, Guoda Tian, Andres Reial, Xuesong Cai, Bo Bernhardsson, Fredrik Tufvesson
Abstract: Artificial intelligence advances have recently influenced wireless communications, including beam management in fifth-generation (5G) new radio systems. AI-driven models and algorithms are being applied to enhance tasks such as beam selection, prediction, and refinement by leveraging real-time and historical data. These approaches address challenges such as mobility under complex channel conditions, showing promising results compared to traditional methods. Beam management in 5G refers to processes that ensure optimal alignment between the base station and user equipment for effective signal transmission and reception based on real-time channel state information and user positioning. This study leverages accurate beam prediction to identify a smaller subset of beams, resulting in a more efficient, streamlined, and link-adaptive communication system. The innovative approach presented introduces a precise, attention-based prediction model that derives the entire downlink transmission chain in a commercial grade 5G system. The predicted downlink beams are specifically tailored to handle the complexities of none line-of-sight environments known for high-dimensional channel dynamics and scatterer-induced signal variations. This novel method introduces a paradigm shift in utilizing environmental and channel dynamics in contrast to conventional procedures of beam management, which entails complex methods involving exhaustive techniques to predict the best beams. The presented beam prediction results demonstrate robustness in addressing the challenges posed by signal-dispersive environments, showcasing great potential in mobility scenarios.

Title: Accelerating Battery Material Optimization through iterative Machine Learning
Authors: Seon-Hwa Lee, Insoo Ye, Changhwan Lee, Jieun Kim, Geunho Choi, Sang-Cheol Nam, Inchul Park
Abstract: The performance of battery materials is determined by their composition and the processing conditions employed during commercial-scale fabrication, where raw materials undergo complex processing steps with various additives to yield final products. As the complexity of these parameters expands with the development of industry, conventional one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiment becomes old fashioned. While domain expertise aids in parameter optimization, this traditional approach becomes increasingly vulnerable to cognitive limitations and anthropogenic biases as the complexity of factors grows. Herein, we introduce an iterative machine learning (ML) framework that integrates active learning to guide targeted experimentation and facilitate incremental model refinement. This method systematically leverages comprehensive experimental observations, including both successful and unsuccessful results, effectively mitigating human-induced biases and alleviating data scarcity. Consequently, it significantly accelerates exploration within the high-dimensional design space. Our results demonstrate that active-learning-driven experimentation markedly reduces the total number of experimental cycles necessary, underscoring the transformative potential of ML-based strategies in expediting battery material optimization.

Title: Ray Antenna Array: A Novel Cost-Effective Multi-Antenna Architecture for Enhanced Wireless Communication
Authors: Zhenjun Dong, Zhiwen Zhou, Yong Zeng
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-antenna architecture, termed ray antenna array (RAA), which aims to enhance wireless communication performance in a cost-effective manner. RAA is composed of massive cheap antenna elements and a few radio frequency (RF) chains. The massive antenna elements are arranged in a novel ray-like structure, with each ray corresponding to a simple uniform linear array (sULA) with a carefully designed orientation. The antenna elements of each sULA are directly connected to an RF combiner, so that the sULA in each ray is able to form a beam towards a direction matching the ray orientation without relying on any analog or digital beamforming. By further designing a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to connect to the RF chains for further baseband processing. Compared to conventional multi-antenna architectures like hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed RAA has two major advantages. First, it can significantly reduce hardware costs since no phase shifters, which are usually expensive especially in high-frequency systems, are required. Besides, RAA can greatly improve system performance by configuring antenna elements with higher directionality, as each sULA only needs to be responsible for a portion of the total coverage angle. To demonstrate such advantages, in this paper, we first present the input-output model for RAA-based wireless communications, based on which the ray orientations of the RAA are designed. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for joint ray selection and beamforming are proposed for single-user and multi-user RAA-based wireless communications. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of RAA compared to HBF while significantly reducing hardware cost.

Title: A Comprehensive PPG-based Dataset for HR/HRV Studies
Authors: Jingye Xu, Yuntong Zhang, Wei Wang, Mimi Xie, Dakai Zhu
Abstract: Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are important vital signs for human physical and mental health. Recent research has demonstrated that photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors can infer HR and HRV. However, it is difficult to find a comprehensive PPG-based dataset for HR/HRV studies, especially for various study needs: multiple scenes, long-term monitoring, and multimodality (multiple PPG channels and extra acceleration data). In this study, we collected a comprehensive multimodal long-term dataset to address the gap of missing an all-in-one HR/HRV dataset (denoted as UTSA-PPG). We began by reviewing state-of-the-art datasets, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. Following this, we developed a custom data acquisition system and then collected the UTSA-PPG dataset and compared its key features with those of existing datasets. Additionally, five case studies were conducted, including comparisons with state-of-the-art datasets. The outcomes highlight the value of our dataset, demonstrating its utility for HR/HRV estimation exploration and its potential to aid researchers in creating generalized models for targeted research challenges.

Title: Dim and Small Target Detection for Drone Broadcast Frames Based on Time-Frequency Analysis
Authors: Jie Li, Jing Li, Zhanyu Ju, Fengkui Gong, Lu Lv
Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol. Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under low signal-to noise ratio (SNR) situations. Besides, a segmented energy refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the average intersection over union, precision, and recall by 3\%, 1.4\%, and 2.4\%, respectively, compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual environment.

Title: Load Forecasting in the Era of Smart Grids: Opportunities and Advanced Machine Learning Models
Authors: Aurausp Maneshni
Abstract: Electric energy is difficult to store, requiring stricter control over its generation, transmission, and distribution. A persistent challenge in power systems is maintaining real-time equilibrium between electricity demand and supply. Oversupply contributes to resource wastage, while undersupply can strain the grid, increase operational costs, and potentially impact service reliability. To maintain grid stability, load forecasting is needed. Accurate load forecasting balances generation and demand by striving to predict future electricity consumption. This thesis examines and evaluates four machine learning frameworks for short term load forecasting, including gradient boosting decision tree methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). A hybrid framework is also developed. In addition, two recurrent neural network architectures, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are designed and implemented. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to assess the relationships between electricity demand and exogenous variables. The experimental results show that, for the specific dataset and forecasting task in this study, machine learning-based models achieved improved forecasting performance compared to a classical ARIMA baseline.

Title: IoT-Enabled Hemodynamic Surveillance System: AD8232 Bioelectric Signal Processing with ESP32
Authors: Hemalatha R J, Shubham Malhotra, Shivapanchakshari T G, Lokesh K, Dev Anand D, Samson Jebakumar S
Abstract: This dissertation proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracking device that diagnoses cardiopulmonary problems using the Internet of Things (IoT) desired results. The initiative is built on the internet observing an electrocardiogram with the AD8232 heart rhythm sensor and the ESP32 expansion kit, using an on-premise connected device platform to transform sensing input into meaningful data. That subsequently supervises an ECG signal and delivers it to an intelligent phone via Wi-Fi for data analysis. That is the pace of the circulating. Assessing body temperature, pulse rate, and coronary arteries are vital measures to defend your health. The heartbeat rate may be measured in two ways: there are by palpating the pulse at the wrist or neck directly or other alternative by utilizing a cardiac sensor. Monitoring alcohol levels in cardiac patients is critical for measuring the influence of liquor on their health and the efficacy of therapy. It assists in recognizing the association between alcohol consumption and cardiac issues, rather than rhythm recorded in beats per minute (bpm). An IR transmitter/receiver pair (OLED) needs to stay compatible up near the sensor's knuckle current or voltage pulse. The detector's electrical output is evaluated by suitable electronic circuits to produce a visual clue (digital display). We must design a cost-effective, user-friendly, and efficient ECG monitoring system with contemporary technology for both persons imprisoned by disease or aging, as well as healthcare professionals. Microcontroller combined with software. A smartphone application is created to monitor the cardiovascular health of distant patients in real-time

Title: NMCSE: Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation Method via Optimal Transport for Cardiovascular Disease Detection
Authors: Zhixin li, Peihong Zhang, Rui Sang, Yuxuan Liu, Shengchen Li
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are linked by a latent coupling signal representing the electrical-to-mechanical cardiac transformation. While valuable for cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, this coupling signal is traditionally estimated using deconvolution methods that amplify noise, limiting clinical utility. In this paper, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates the problem as distribution matching via optimal transport theory. By jointly optimizing amplitude and temporal alignment, NMCSE mitigates noise amplification without additional preprocessing. Integrated with our Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction network, NMCSE enables robust multi-modal CVD detection. Experiments on the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with realistic hospital noise demonstrate that NMCSE reduces estimation errors by approximately 30% in Mean Squared Error while maintaining higher Pearson Correlation Coefficients across all tested signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach achieves 97.38% accuracy and 0.98 AUC in CVD detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robust performance for real-world clinical applications.

Title: Evaluation in EEG Emotion Recognition: State-of-the-Art Review and Unified Framework
Authors: Natia Kukhilava, Tatia Tsmindashvili, Rapael Kalandadze, Anchit Gupta, Sofio Katamadze, François Brémond, Laura M. Ferrari, Philipp Müller, Benedikt Emanuel Wirth
Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between 2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol, which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types (e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, EEGain (this https URL), which enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare - and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER, MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall progress of the field.

Title: Machine Learning-Based Analysis of ECG and PCG Signals for Rheumatic Heart Disease Detection: A Scoping Review (2015-2025)
Authors: Damilare Emmanuel Olatunji, Julius Dona Zannu, Carine Pierrette Mukamakuza, Godbright Nixon Uiso, Mona Mamoun Mubarak Aman, John Bosco Thuo, Chol Buol, Nchofon Tagha Ghogomu, Evelyne Umubyeyi
Abstract: Objective: To conduct a systematic assessment of machine learning applications that utilize electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart sound data in the development of cost-effective detection tools for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) from the year 2015 to 2025, thereby supporting the World Heart Federation's "25 by 25" mortality reduction objective through the creation of alternatives to echocardiography in underserved regions. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Embase for peer-reviewed literature focusing on ML-based ECG/PCG analysis for RHD detection. Two independent reviewers screened studies, and data extraction focused on methodology, validation approaches, and performance metrics. Results: Analysis of 37 relevant studies revealed that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the predominant technology in post-2020 implementations, achieving a median accuracy of 93.7%. However, 73% of studies relied on single-center datasets, only 10.8% incorporated external validation, and none addressed cost-effectiveness. Performance varied markedly across different valvular lesions, and despite 44% of studies originating from endemic regions, significant gaps persisted in implementation science and demographic diversity. Conclusion: While ML-based ECG/PCG analysis shows promise for RHD detection, substantial methodological limitations hinder clinical translation. Future research must prioritize standardized benchmarking frameworks, multimodal architectures, cost-effectiveness assessments, and prospective trials in endemic settings. Significance: This review provides a critical roadmap for developing accessible ML-based RHD screening tools to help bridge the diagnostic gap in resourceconstrained settings where conventional auscultation misses up to 90% of cases and echocardiography remains inaccessible.

Title: FRAME-C: A knowledge-augmented deep learning pipeline for classifying multi-electrode array electrophysiological signals
Authors: Nisal Ranasinghe, Dzung Do-Ha, Simon Maksour, Tamasha Malepathirana, Sachith Seneviratne, Lezanne Ooi, Saman Halgamuge
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration, with alterations in neural excitability serving as key indicators. Recent advancements in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology have enabled the generation of human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, which, when combined with multi-electrode array (MEA) electrophysiology, provide rich spatial and temporal electrophysiological data. Traditionally, MEA data is analyzed using handcrafted features based on potentially imperfect domain knowledge, which while useful may not fully capture all useful characteristics inherent in the data. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has the potential to automatically learn relevant characteristics from raw data without solely relying on handcrafted feature extraction. However, handcrafted features remain critical for encoding domain knowledge and improving interpretability, especially with limited or noisy data. This study introduces FRAME-C, a knowledge-augmented machine learning pipeline that combines domain knowledge, raw spike waveform data, and deep learning techniques to classify MEA signals and identify ALS-specific phenotypes. FRAME-C leverages deep learning to learn important features from spike waveforms while incorporating handcrafted features such as spike amplitude, inter-spike interval, and spike duration, preserving key spatial and temporal information. We validate FRAME-C on both simulated and real MEA data from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, demonstrating superior performance over existing classification methods. FRAME-C shows over 11% improvement on real data and up to 25% on simulated data. We also show FRAME-C can evaluate handcrafted feature importance, providing insights into ALS phenotypes.

Title: AI- Enhanced Stethoscope in Remote Diagnostics for Cardiopulmonary Diseases
Authors: Hania Ghouse, Juveria Tanveen, Abdul Muqtadir Ahmed, Uma N. Dulhare
Abstract: The increase in cardiac and pulmonary diseases presents an alarming and pervasive health challenge on a global scale responsible for unexpected and premature mortalities. In spite of how serious these conditions are, existing methods of detection and treatment encounter challenges, particularly in achieving timely diagnosis for effective medical intervention. Manual screening processes commonly used for primary detection of cardiac and respiratory problems face inherent limitations, increased by a scarcity of skilled medical practitioners in remote or under-resourced areas. To address this, our study introduces an innovative yet efficient model which integrates AI for diagnosing lung and heart conditions concurrently using the auscultation sounds. Unlike the already high-priced digital stethoscope, our proposed model has been particularly designed to deploy on low-cost embedded devices and thus ensure applicability in under-developed regions that actually face an issue of accessing medical care. Our proposed model incorporates MFCC feature extraction and engineering techniques to ensure that the signal is well analyzed for accurate diagnostics through the hybrid model combining Gated Recurrent Unit with CNN in processing audio signals recorded from the low-cost stethoscope. Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, the model generates digital audio records that facilitate in classifying six pulmonary and five cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the integration of a cost effective stethoscope with an efficient AI empowered model deployed on a web app providing real-time analysis, represents a transformative step towards standardized healthcare

Title: BrainOmni: A Brain Foundation Model for Unified EEG and MEG Signals
Authors: Qinfan Xiao, Ziyun Cui, Chi Zhang, Siqi Chen, Wen Wu, Andrew Thwaites, Alexandra Woolgar, Bowen Zhou, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Improving Generative Inverse Design of Rectangular Patch Antennas with Test Time Optimization
Authors: Beck LaBash, Shahriar Khushrushahi, Fabian Ruehle
Abstract: We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for the inverse design of rectangular patch antennas. Our approach leverages generative modeling to learn a latent representation of antenna frequency response curves and conditions a subsequent generative model on these responses to produce feasible antenna geometries. We further demonstrate that leveraging search and optimization techniques at test-time improves the accuracy of the generated designs and enables consideration of auxiliary objectives such as manufacturability. Our approach generalizes naturally to different design criteria, and can be easily adapted to more complex geometric design spaces.

Title: Generating Realistic Multi-Beat ECG Signals
Authors: Paul Pöhl, Viktor Schlegel, Hao Li, Anil Bharath
Abstract: Generating synthetic ECG data has numerous applications in healthcare, from educational purposes to simulating scenarios and forecasting trends. While recent diffusion models excel at generating short ECG segments, they struggle with longer sequences needed for many clinical applications. This paper proposes a novel three-layer synthesis framework for generating realistic long-form ECG signals. We first generate high-fidelity single beats using a diffusion model, then synthesize inter-beat features preserving critical temporal dependencies, and finally assemble beats into coherent long sequences using feature-guided matching. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the resulting synthetic ECGs maintain both beat-level morphological fidelity and clinically relevant inter-beat relationships. In arrhythmia classification tasks, our long-form synthetic ECGs significantly outperform end-to-end long-form ECG generation using the diffusion model, highlighting their potential for increasing utility for downstream applications. The approach enables generation of unprecedented multi-minute ECG sequences while preserving essential diagnostic characteristics.

Title: PhySense: Sensor Placement Optimization for Accurate Physics Sensing
Authors: Yuezhou Ma, Haixu Wu, Hang Zhou, Huikun Weng, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long
Abstract: Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. \correct{Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, }the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. \correct{We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees.} Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

Title: SzCORE as a benchmark: report from the seizure detection challenge at the 2025 AI in Epilepsy and Neurological Disorders Conference
Authors: Jonathan Dan, Amirhossein Shahbazinia, Christodoulos Kechris, David Atienza
Abstract: Reliable automatic seizure detection from long-term EEG remains a challenge, as current machine learning models often fail to generalize across patients or clinical settings. Manual EEG review remains the clinical standard, underscoring the need for robust models and standardized evaluation. To rigorously assess algorithm performance, we organized a challenge using a private dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 65 subjects (4,360 hours). Expert neurophysiologists annotated the data, providing ground truth for seizure events. Participants were required to detect seizure onset and duration, with evaluation based on event-based metrics, including sensitivity, precision, F1-score, and false positives per day. The SzCORE framework ensured standardized evaluation. The primary ranking criterion was the event-based F1-score, reflecting clinical relevance by balancing sensitivity and false positives. The challenge received 30 submissions from 19 teams, with 28 algorithms evaluated. Results revealed wide variability in performance, with a top F1-score of 43% (sensitivity 37%, precision 45%), highlighting the ongoing difficulty of seizure detection. The challenge also revealed a gap between reported performance and real-world evaluation, emphasizing the importance of rigorous benchmarking. Compared to previous challenges and commercial systems, the best-performing algorithm in this contest showed improved performance. Importantly, the challenge platform now supports continuous benchmarking, enabling reproducible research, integration of new datasets, and clinical evaluation of seizure detection algorithms using a standardized framework.

Title: Large Language Model-Driven Distributed Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Semantic Communications
Authors: Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Bingxin Zhang, Kun Yang
Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework. Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion. Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM) with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves a good performance.

Title: Acoustic and Machine Learning Methods for Speech-Based Suicide Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review
Authors: Ambre Marie, Marine Garnier, Thomas Bertin, Laura Machart, Guillaume Dardenne, Gwenolé Quellec, Sofian Berrouiguet
Abstract: Suicide remains a public health challenge, necessitating improved detection methods to facilitate timely intervention and treatment. This systematic review evaluates the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in assessing suicide risk through acoustic analysis of speech. Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 33 articles selected from PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. These studies primarily explored acoustic differences between individuals at risk of suicide (RS) and those not at risk (NRS), and evaluated ML classifier performance. Findings consistently showed significant acoustic feature variations between RS and NRS populations, particularly involving jitter, fundamental frequency (F0), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and power spectral density (PSD). Classifier effectiveness varied based on algorithms, modalities, and speech elicitation methods, with multimodal approaches integrating acoustic, linguistic, and metadata features demonstrating superior performance. However, limitations such as methodological variability, small sample sizes, lack of longitudinal data, and limited linguistic and demographic diversity restrict generalizability. Future research should focus on standardizing methods, expanding multimodal analyses, and utilizing larger, diverse datasets to support AI integration in clinical suicide risk assessment.

Title: CrossRF: A Domain-Invariant Deep Learning Approach for RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Fahrettin Emin Tiras, Hayriye Serra Altinoluk
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to 99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only 26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels 1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.

Title: Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms for Energy Management Systems in Microgrids: A Control Strategy Based on a PHIL System
Authors: Saiful Islam, Sanaz Mostaghim, Michael Hartmann
Abstract: In this research a real time power hardware in loop configuration has been implemented for an microgrid with the combination of distribution energy resources such as photovoltaic, grid tied inverter, battery, utility grid, and a diesel generator. This paper introduces an unique adaptive multi-objective optimization approach that employs weighted optimization techniques for real-time microgrid systems. The aim is to effectively balance various factors including fuel consumption, load mismatch, power quality, battery degradation, and the utilization of renewable energy sources. A real time experimental data from power hardware in loop system has been used for dynamically updating system states. The adaptive preference-based selection method are adjusted based on state of battery charging thresholds. The technique has been integrated with six technical objectives and complex constraints. This approach helps to practical microgrid decision making and optimization of dynamic energy systems. The energy management process were also able to maximize photovoltaic production where minimizing power mismatch, stabilizing battery state of charge under different condition. The research results were also compared with the baseline system without optimization techniques, and a reliable outcome was found.

Title: ATMM-SAGA: Alternating Training for Multi-Module with Score-Aware Gated Attention SASV system
Authors: Amro Asali, Yehuda Ben-Shimol, Itshak Lapidot
Abstract: The objective of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems is to determine whether a given test speech utterance corresponds to a claimed enrolled speaker. These systems have a wide range of applications, and ensuring their reliability is crucial. In this paper, we propose a spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification (SASV) system employing a score-aware gated attention (SAGA) fusion scheme, integrating scores from a pre-trained countermeasure (CM) with speaker embeddings from a pre-trained ASV. Specifically, we employ the AASIST and ECAPA-TDNN models. SAGA acts as an adaptive gating mechanism, where the CM score determines how strongly ASV embeddings influence the final SASV decision. Experiments on the ASVspoof2019 logical access dataset demonstrate that the proposed SASV system achieves an SASV equal error rate (SASV-EER) and agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF) of 2.31%, 0.0603 for the development set and 2.18%, 0.0480 for the evaluation set.

Title: Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC
Authors: Yiting Chen, Francesco Bullo, Emiliano Dall'Anese
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T>0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem. We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T < T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.

Title: Single Snapshot Distillation for Phase Coded Mask Design in Phase Retrieval
Authors: Karen Fonseca, Leon Suarez-Rodriguez, Andres Jerez, Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan, Henry Arguello
Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) reconstructs phase information from magnitude measurements, known as coded diffraction patterns (CDPs), whose quality depends on the number of snapshots captured using coded phase masks. High-quality phase estimation requires multiple snapshots, which is not desired for efficient PR systems. End-to-end frameworks enable joint optimization of the optical system and the recovery neural network. However, their application is constrained by physical implementation limitations. Additionally, the framework is prone to gradient vanishing issues related to its global optimization process. This paper introduces a Knowledge Distillation (KD) optimization approach to address these limitations. KD transfers knowledge from a larger, lower-constrained network (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient, and implementable network (student). In this method, the teacher, a PR system trained with multiple snapshots, distills its knowledge into a single-snapshot PR system, the student. The loss functions compare the CPMs and the feature space of the recovery network. Simulations demonstrate that this approach improves reconstruction performance compared to a PR system trained without the teacher's guidance.

Title: Current-Steering DAC Architecture Design for Amplitude Mismatch Error Minimization
Authors: Ramin Babaee, Shahab Oveis Gharan, Martin Bouchard
Abstract: We propose a novel digital-to-analog converter (DAC) weighting architecture that statistically minimizes the distortion caused by random current mismatches. Unlike binary, thermometer-coded, and segmented DACs, the current weights of the proposed architecture are not an integer power of 2 or any other integer number. We present a heuristic algorithm for a static mapping of DAC input codewords into corresponding DAC switches. High-level Matlab simulations are performed to illustrate the static performance improvement over the segmented structure.

Title: Brightness-Invariant Tracking Estimation in Tagged MRI
Authors: Zhangxing Bian, Shuwen Wei, Xiao Liang, Yuan-Chiao Lu, Samuel W. Remedios, Fangxu Xing, Jonghye Woo, Dzung L. Pham, Aaron Carass, Philip V. Bayly, Jiachen Zhuo, Ahmed Alshareef, Jerry L. Prince
Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation (BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.

Title: Frequency and Bandwidth Design of FR3-Band Acoustic Filters
Authors: Taran Anusorn, Omar Barrera, Jack Kramer, Ian Anderson, Ziqian Yao, Vakhtang Chulukhadze, Ruochen Lu
Abstract: This article presents an approach to control the operating frequency and fractional bandwidth (FBW) of miniature acoustic filters in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). More specifically, we used the first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode in lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators (XBARs) to achieve efficient operation at 20.5 GHz. Our technique leverages the thickness-dependent resonance frequency of A1 XBARs, combined with the in-plane anisotropic properties of 128$^\circ$ Y-cut TFLN, to customize filter characteristics. The implemented three-element ladder filter prototype achieves an insertion loss (IL) of only 1.79 dB and a controlled 3-dB FBW of 8.58% at 20.5 GHz, with an out-of-band (OoB) rejection greater than 14.9 dB across the entire FR3 band, while featuring a compact footprint of 0.90 $\times$ 0.74 mm$^2$. Moreover, an eight-element filter prototype shows an IL of 3.80 dB, an FBW of 6.12% at 22.0 GHz, and a high OoB rejection of 22.97 dB, demonstrating the potential for expanding to higher-order filters. As frequency allocation requirements become more stringent in future FR3 bands, our technique showcases promising capability in enabling compact and monolithic filter banks toward next-generation acoustic filters for 6G and beyond.

Title: How We Won the ISLES'24 Challenge by Preprocessing
Authors: Tianyi Ren, Juampablo E. Heras Rivera, Hitender Oswal, Yutong Pan, William Henry, Jacob Ruzevick, Mehmet Kurt
Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

Title: CHSER: A Dataset and Case Study on Generative Speech Error Correction for Child ASR
Authors: Natarajan Balaji Shankar, Zilai Wang, Kaiyuan Zhang, Mohan Shi, Abeer Alwan
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with child speech due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic variability and limited availability of child speech datasets, leading to high transcription error rates. While ASR error correction (AEC) methods have improved adult speech transcription, their effectiveness on child speech remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce CHSER, a Generative Speech Error Correction (GenSEC) dataset for child speech, comprising 200K hypothesis-transcription pairs spanning diverse age groups and speaking styles. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning on the CHSER dataset achieves up to a 28.5% relative WER reduction in a zero-shot setting and a 13.3% reduction when applied to fine-tuned ASR systems. Additionally, our error analysis reveals that while GenSEC improves substitution and deletion errors, it struggles with insertions and child-specific disfluencies. These findings highlight the potential of GenSEC for improving child ASR.

Title: Distinctive Feature Codec: Adaptive Segmentation for Efficient Speech Representation
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Fuming Fang, Peng Gao, Bin Qin, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps
Abstract: The tokenization of speech with neural speech codec models is a crucial aspect of AI systems designed for speech understanding and generation. While text-based systems naturally benefit from token boundaries between discrete symbols, tokenizing continuous speech signals is more complex due to the unpredictable timing of important acoustic variations. Most current neural speech codecs typically address this by using uniform processing at fixed time intervals, which overlooks the varying information density inherent in speech. In this paper, we introduce a distinctive feature-based approach that dynamically allocates tokens based on the perceptual significance of speech content. By learning to identify and prioritize distinctive regions in speech signals, our approach achieves a significantly more efficient speech representation compared with conventional frame-based methods. This work marks the first successful extension of traditional signal processing-based distinctive features into deep learning frameworks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide theoretical insights into how aligning segment boundaries with natural acoustic transitions improves codebook utilization. Additionally, we enhance tokenization stability by developing a Group-wise Scalar Quantization approach for variable-length segments. Our distinctive feature-based approach offers a promising alternative to conventional frame-based processing and advances interpretable representation learning in the modern deep learning speech processing framework.

Title: TS-URGENet: A Three-stage Universal Robust and Generalizable Speech Enhancement Network
Authors: Xiaobin Rong, Dahan Wang, Qinwen Hu, Yushi Wang, Yuxiang Hu, Jing Lu
Abstract: Universal speech enhancement aims to handle input speech with different distortions and input formats. To tackle this challenge, we present TS-URGENet, a Three-Stage Universal, Robust, and Generalizable speech Enhancement Network. To address various distortions, the proposed system employs a novel three-stage architecture consisting of a filling stage, a separation stage, and a restoration stage. The filling stage mitigates packet loss by preliminarily filling lost regions under noise interference, ensuring signal continuity. The separation stage suppresses noise, reverberation, and clipping distortion to improve speech clarity. Finally, the restoration stage compensates for bandwidth limitation, codec artifacts, and residual packet loss distortion, refining the overall speech quality. Our proposed TS-URGENet achieved outstanding performance in the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge, ranking 2nd in Track 1.

Title: A DSP-Free Carrier Phase Recovery System using 16-Offset-QAM Laser Forwarded Links for 400Gb/s and Beyond
Authors: Marziyeh Rezaei, Dan Sturm, Pengyu Zeng, Sajjad Moazeni
Abstract: Optical interconnects are becoming a major bottleneck in scaling up future GPU racks and network switches within data centers. Although 200 Gb/s optical transceivers using PAM-4 modulation have been demonstrated, achieving higher data rates and energy efficiencies requires high-order coherent modulations like 16-QAM. Current coherent links rely on energy-intensive digital signal processing (DSP) for channel impairment compensation and carrier phase recovery (CPR), which consumes approximately 50pJ/b - 10x higher than future intra-data center requirements. For shorter links, simpler or DSP-free CPR methods can significantly reduce power and complexity. While Costas loops enable CPR for QPSK, they face challenges in scaling to higher-order modulations (e.g., 16/64-QAM) due to varying symbol amplitudes. In this work, we propose an optical coherent link architecture using laser forwarding and a novel DSP-free CPR system using offset-QAM modulation. The proposed analog CPR feedback loop is highly scalable, capable of supporting arbitrary offset-QAM modulations without requiring architectural modifications. This scalability is achieved through its phase error detection mechanism, which operates independently of the data rate and modulation type. We validated this method using GlobalFoundry's monolithic 45nm silicon photonics PDK models, with circuit- and system-level implementation at 100GBaud in the O-band. We will investigate the feedback loop dynamics, circuit-level implementations, and phase-noise performance of the proposed CPR loop. Our method can be adopted to realize low-power QAM optical interconnects for future coherent-lite pluggable transceivers as well as co-packaged optics (CPO) applications.

Title: Mind Your Vision: Multimodal Estimation of Refractive Disorders Using Electrooculography and Eye Tracking
Authors: Xin Wei, Huakun Liu, Yutaro Hirao, Monica Perusquia-Hernandez, Katsutoshi Masai, Hideaki Uchiyama, Kiyoshi Kiyokawa
Abstract: Refractive errors are among the most common visual impairments globally, yet their diagnosis often relies on active user participation and clinical oversight. This study explores a passive method for estimating refractive power using two eye movement recording techniques: electrooculography (EOG) and video-based eye tracking. Using a publicly available dataset recorded under varying diopter conditions, we trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify refractive power from unimodal (EOG or eye tracking) and multimodal configuration. We assess performance in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings to evaluate model personalization and generalizability across individuals. Results show that the multimodal model consistently outperforms unimodal models, achieving the highest average accuracy in both settings: 96.207\% in the subject-dependent scenario and 8.882\% in the subject-independent scenario. However, generalization remains limited, with classification accuracy only marginally above chance in the subject-independent evaluations. Statistical comparisons in the subject-dependent setting confirmed that the multimodal model significantly outperformed the EOG and eye-tracking models. However, no statistically significant differences were found in the subject-independent setting. Our findings demonstrate both the potential and current limitations of eye movement data-based refractive error estimation, contributing to the development of continuous, non-invasive screening methods using EOG signals and eye-tracking data.

Title: ReflectGAN: Modeling Vegetation Effects for Soil Carbon Estimation from Satellite Imagery
Authors: Dristi Datta, Manoranjan Paul, Manzur Murshed, Shyh Wei Teng, Leigh M. Schmidtke
Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator of soil health, but its accurate estimation from satellite imagery is hindered in vegetated regions due to spectral contamination from plant cover, which obscures soil reflectance and reduces model reliability. This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation Generative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework designed to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil satellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between vegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC estimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and corresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on both original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained on ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation correction methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an $R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the ReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\% reduction in RMSE, and a 43\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing method (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better compared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e., Sentinel-2 imagery. These findings demonstrate the potential of ReflectGAN to improve SOC estimation accuracy in vegetated landscapes, supporting more reliable soil monitoring.

Title: FDMA-Based Passive Multiple Users SWIPT Utilizing Resonant Beams
Authors: Yixuan Guo, Mingliang Xiong, Wen Fang, Qingwei Jiang, Qingwen Liu, Gang Yan
Abstract: The rapid development of IoT technology has led to a shortage of spectrum resources and energy, giving rise to simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology. However, traditional multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-based SWIPT faces challenges in target detection. We have designed a passive multi-user resonant beam system (MU-RBS) that can achieve efficient power transfer and communication through adaptive beam alignment. The frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is employed in the downlink (DL) channel, while frequency conversion is utilized in the uplink (UL) channel to avoid echo interference and co-channel interference, and the system architecture design and corresponding mathematical model are presented. The simulation results show that MU-RBS can achieve adaptive beam-forming without the target transmitting pilot signals, has high directivity, and as the number of iterations increases, the power transmission efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio and spectral efficiency of the UL and DL are continuously optimized until the system reaches the optimal state.

Title: Enhancing Generalization of Speech Large Language Models with Multi-Task Behavior Imitation and Speech-Text Interleaving
Authors: Jingran Xie, Xiang Li, Hui Wang, Yue Yu, Yang Xiang, Xixin Wu, Zhiyong Wu
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM. Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech data.

Title: Memory-Efficient Super-Resolution of 3D Micro-CT Images Using Octree-Based GANs: Enhancing Resolution and Segmentation Accuracy
Authors: Evgeny Ugolkov, Xupeng He, Hyung Kwak, Hussein Hoteit
Abstract: We present a memory-efficient algorithm for significantly enhancing the quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks using a generative model. The proposed model achieves a 16x increase in resolution and corrects inaccuracies in segmentation caused by the overlapping X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurements across different minerals. The generative model employed is a 3D Octree-based convolutional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. To address the challenge of high memory consumption inherent in standard 3D convolutional layers, we implemented an Octree structure within the 3D progressive growing generator model. This enabled the use of memory-efficient 3D Octree-based convolutional layers. The approach is pivotal in overcoming the long-standing memory bottleneck in volumetric deep learning, making it possible to reach 16x super-resolution in 3D, a scale that is challenging to attain due to cubic memory scaling. For training, we utilized segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT images along with unpaired segmented complementary 2D high-resolution laser scanning microscope images. Post-training, resolution improved from 7 to 0.44 micro-m/voxel with accurate segmentation of constituent minerals. Validated on Berea sandstone, this framework demonstrates substantial improvements in pore characterization and mineral differentiation, offering a robust solution to one of the primary computational limitations in modern geoscientific imaging.

Title: EOTNet: Deep Memory Aided Bayesian Filter for Extended Object Tracking
Authors: Zhixing Wang, Le Zheng, Shi Yan, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, Nir Shlezinger, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: Extended object tracking methods based on random matrices, founded on Bayesian filters, have been able to achieve efficient recursive processes while jointly estimating the kinematic states and extension of the targets. Existing random matrix approaches typically assume that the evolution of state and extension follows a first-order Markov process, where the current estimate of the target depends solely on the previous moment. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption fails because the evolution of states and extension is usually non-Markovian. In this paper, we introduce a novel extended object tracking method: a Bayesian recursive neural network assisted by deep memory. Initially, we propose an equivalent model under a non-Markovian assumption and derive the implementation of its Bayesian filtering framework. Thereafter, Gaussian approximation and moment matching are employed to derive the analytical solution for the proposed Bayesian filtering framework. Finally, based on the closed-form solution, we design an end-to-end trainable Bayesian recursive neural network for extended object tracking. Experiment results on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods outperforms traditional extended object tracking methods and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

Title: Evaluating the Usefulness of Non-Diagnostic Speech Data for Developing Parkinson's Disease Classifiers
Authors: Terry Yi Zhong, Esther Janse, Cristian Tejedor-Garcia, Louis ten Bosch, Martha Larson
Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker performance.

Title: Waveform Coexistence-Driven RSMA: A Pioneering Strategy for Future 6G Networks
Authors: Kenza Abela, Shaima Abidrabbu, Ayoub Ammar Boudjelal, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: Two critical approaches have emerged in the literature for the successful realization of 6G wireless networks: the coexistence of multiple waveforms and the adoption of non-orthogonal multiple access. These strategies hold transformative potential for addressing the limitations of current systems and enabling the robust and scalable design of next-generation wireless networks. This paper presents a novel rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) framework that leverages the coexistence of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). By transmitting common data via AFDM at higher power in the affine domain and private data via OFDM at lower power in the frequency domain, the proposed framework eliminates the reliance on successive interference cancellation (SIC), significantly simplifying receiver design. Furthermore, two data mapping approaches are proposed: a clean pilot method, where pilots are allocated without any data overlapping, ensuring clear separation, and an embedded pilot method, where pilots overlap with data for more efficient resource utilization. Channel estimation is then performed for different channel types. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach, achieving superior performance in efficiency, reliability, and adaptability under diverse channel conditions. This framework transforms non-orthogonal multi-access design, paving the way for scalable and efficient solutions in 6G networks.

Title: Season-Independent PV Disaggregation Using Multi-Scale Net Load Temporal Feature Extraction and Weather Factor Fusion
Authors: Xiaolu Chen, Chenghao Huang, Yanru Zhang, Hao Wang
Abstract: With the advancement of energy Internet and energy system integration, the increasing adoption of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems presents new challenges on smart monitoring and measurement for utility companies, particularly in separating PV generation from net electricity load. Existing methods struggle with feature extraction from net load and capturing the relevance between weather factors. This paper proposes a PV disaggregation method that integrates Hierarchical Interpolation (HI) and multi-head self-attention mechanisms. By using HI to extract net load features and multi-head self-attention to capture the complex dependencies between weather factors, the method achieves precise PV generation predictions. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world data, supporting improved monitoring and management of distributed energy systems.

Title: Agent-Based Decentralized Energy Management of EV Charging Station with Solar Photovoltaics via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jiarong Fan, Chenghao Huang, Hao Wang
Abstract: In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario, where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.

Title: A physics-guided smoothing method for material modeling with digital image correlation (DIC) measurements
Authors: Jihong Wang, Chung-Hao Lee, William Richardson, Yue Yu
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to process the DIC measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols. In particular, we develop a optimization-based approach, which calculates the smoothed nodal displacements using a moving least-squares algorithm subject to positive strain constraints. As such, physically consistent displacement and strain fields are obtained. Then, we further deploy a data-driven workflow to heterogeneous material modeling from these physically consistent DIC measurements, by estimating a nonlocal constitutive law together with the material microstructure. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it in learning a material model and fiber orientation field from DIC measurements of a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DIC data processing approach can significantly improve the accuracy of modeling biological materials.

Title: Distributed Expectation Propagation for Multi-Object Tracking over Sensor Networks
Authors: Qing Li, Runze Gan, James R. Hopgood, Michael E. Davies, Simon J. Godsill
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel distributed expectation propagation algorithm for multiple sensors, multiple objects tracking in cluttered environments. The proposed framework enables each sensor to operate locally while collaboratively exchanging moment estimates with other sensors, thus eliminating the need to transmit all data to a central processing node. Specifically, we introduce a fast and parallelisable Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling scheme to approximate the tilted distributions, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of expectation propagation updates. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves both communication and inference efficiency for multi-object tracking tasks with dynamic sensor connectivity and varying clutter levels.

Title: Three-Dimensional Nonlinear Guidance with Impact Time and Field-of-view Constraints
Authors: Ashok R Samrat, Swati Singh, Shashi Ranjan Kumar
Abstract: This paper addresses the time-constrained interception of targets at a predetermined time with bounded field-of-view capability of the seeker-equipped interceptors. We propose guidance laws using the effective lead angle and velocity lead angles of the interceptor to achieve a successful interception of the target. The former scheme extends the existing two-dimensional guidance strategy to a three-dimensional setting. We have shown that such an extension may result in high-frequency switching in the input demand, which may degrade the interceptor's performance. To overcome the potential limitations of such a guidance strategy, we propose an elegant solution using the velocity lead angles and the range error with a backstepping technique. Using the velocity lead angles as virtual inputs, the effective lead angle profile is subsequently regulated to satisfy the seeker's field-of-view bound. Unlike the existing strategies, the proposed guidance strategy does not rely on the time-to-go estimate, which is an appealing feature of the design, as the time-to-go estimate may not always be available with high precision. We provide a theoretical analysis of the error variable and subsequently analytically derive the bounds on achievable impact times. Numerical simulations are performed to support the theoretical findings. The performance of the proposed guidance strategy is compared with that of an existing one, and it has been shown to yield better performance. Finally, a study on different choices of virtual inputs is also provided.

Title: Context-Driven Dynamic Pruning for Large Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Masao Someki, Shikhar Bharadwaj, Atharva Anand Joshi, Chyi-Jiunn Lin, Jinchuan Tian, Jee-weon Jung, Markus Müller, Nathan Susanj, Jing Liu, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Speech foundation models achieve strong generalization across languages and acoustic conditions, but require significant computational resources for inference. In the context of speech foundation models, pruning techniques have been studied that dynamically optimize model structures based on the target audio leveraging external context. In this work, we extend this line of research and propose context-driven dynamic pruning, a technique that optimizes the model computation depending on the context between different input frames and additional context during inference. We employ the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) and incorporate speaker embeddings, acoustic event embeddings, and language information as additional context. By incorporating the speaker embedding, our method achieves a reduction of 56.7 GFLOPs while improving BLEU scores by a relative 25.7% compared to the fully fine-tuned OWSM model.

Title: SW-ViT: A Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer Network with Post Denoiser for Sequential Multi-Push Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography
Authors: Ahsan Habib Akash, MD Jahin Alam, Md. Kamrul Hasan
Abstract: Objective: Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) demonstrates great potential in assessing soft-tissue pathology by mapping tissue stiffness, which is linked to malignancy. Traditional SWE methods have shown promise in estimating tissue elasticity, yet their susceptibility to noise interference, reliance on limited training data, and inability to generate segmentation masks concurrently present notable challenges to accuracy and reliability. Approach: In this paper, we propose SW-ViT, a novel two-stage deep learning framework for SWE that integrates a CNN-Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer-based reconstruction network with an efficient Transformer-based post-denoising network. The first stage uses a 3D ResNet encoder with multi-resolution spatio-temporal Transformer blocks that capture spatial and temporal features, followed by a squeeze-and-excitation attention decoder that reconstructs 2D stiffness maps. To address data limitations, a patch-based training strategy is adopted for localized learning and reconstruction. In the second stage, a denoising network with a shared encoder and dual decoders processes inclusion and background regions to produce a refined stiffness map and segmentation mask. A hybrid loss combining regional, smoothness, fusion, and Intersection over Union (IoU) components ensures improvements in both reconstruction and segmentation. Results: On simulated data, our method achieves PSNR of 32.68 dB, CNR of 46.78 dB, and SSIM of 0.995. On phantom data, results include PSNR of 21.11 dB, CNR of 42.14 dB, and SSIM of 0.936. Segmentation IoU values reach 0.949 (simulation) and 0.738 (phantom) with ASSD values being 0.184 and 1.011, respectively. Significance: SW-ViT delivers robust, high-quality elasticity map estimates from noisy SWE data and holds clear promise for clinical application.

Title: Robust Stability Analysis of Positive Lure System with Neural Network Feedback
Authors: Hamidreza Montazeri Hedesh, Moh. Kamalul Wafi, Bahram Shafai, Milad Siami
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and the robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose a refinement method for sector bounds of feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are supported by illustrative examples.

Title: Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Nonlinear Friction Model of Bow-string Interaction
Authors: Xinmeng Luan, Gary Scavone
Abstract: This study investigates the use of an unsupervised, physics-informed deep learning framework to model a one-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system subjected to a nonlinear friction bow force and governed by a set of ordinary differential equations. Specifically, it examines the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Physics-Informed Deep Operator Networks (PI-DeepONets). Our findings demonstrate that PINNs successfully address the problem across different bow force scenarios, while PI-DeepONets perform well under low bow forces but encounter difficulties at higher forces. Additionally, we analyze the Hessian eigenvalue density and visualize the loss landscape. Overall, the presence of large Hessian eigenvalues and sharp minima indicates highly ill-conditioned optimization. These results underscore the promise of physics-informed deep learning for nonlinear modelling in musical acoustics, while also revealing the limitations of relying solely on physics-based approaches to capture complex nonlinearities. We demonstrate that PI-DeepONets, with their ability to generalize across varying parameters, are well-suited for sound synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the limitations of PI-DeepONets under higher forces can be mitigated by integrating observation data within a hybrid supervised-unsupervised framework. This suggests that a hybrid supervised-unsupervised DeepONets framework could be a promising direction for future practical applications.

Title: Revival with Voice: Multi-modal Controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Minsu Kim, Pingchuan Ma, Honglie Chen, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic
Abstract: This paper explores multi-modal controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) where the voice can be generated from face image, and the characteristics of output speech (e.g., pace, noise level, distance, tone, place) can be controllable with natural text description. Specifically, we aim to mitigate the following three challenges in face-driven TTS systems. 1) To overcome the limited audio quality of audio-visual speech corpora, we propose a training method that additionally utilizes high-quality audio-only speech corpora. 2) To generate voices not only from real human faces but also from artistic portraits, we propose augmenting the input face image with stylization. 3) To consider one-to-many possibilities in face-to-voice mapping and ensure consistent voice generation at the same time, we propose to first employ sampling-based decoding and then use prompting with generated speech samples. Experimental results validate the proposed model's effectiveness in face-driven voice synthesis.

Title: A Derivative-Free Position Optimization Approach for Movable Antenna Multi-User Communication Systems
Authors: Xianlong Zeng, Jun Fang, Peilan Wang, Weidong Mei, Ying-Chang Liang
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as a disruptive technology in wireless communications for enhancing spatial degrees of freedom through continuous antenna repositioning within predefined regions, thereby creating favorable channel propagation conditions. In this paper, we study the problem of position optimization for MA-enabled multi-user MISO systems, where a base station (BS), equipped with multiple MAs, communicates with multiple users each equipped with a single fixed-position antenna (FPA). To circumvent the difficulty of acquiring the channel state information (CSI) from the transmitter to the receiver over the entire movable region, we propose a derivative-free approach for MA position optimization. The basic idea is to treat position optimization as a closed-box optimization problem and calculate the gradient of the unknown objective function using zeroth-order (ZO) gradient approximation techniques. Specifically, the proposed method does not need to explicitly estimate the global CSI. Instead, it adaptively refines its next movement based on previous measurements such that it eventually converges to an optimum or stationary solution. Simulation results show that the proposed derivative-free approach is able to achieve higher sample and computational efficiencies than the CSI estimation-based position optimization approach, particularly for challenging scenarios where the number of multi-path components (MPCs) is large or the number of pilot signals is limited.

Title: Speech-IFEval: Evaluating Instruction-Following and Quantifying Catastrophic Forgetting in Speech-Aware Language Models
Authors: Ke-Han Lu, Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: We introduce Speech-IFeval, an evaluation framework designed to assess instruction-following capabilities and quantify catastrophic forgetting in speech-aware language models (SLMs). Recent SLMs integrate speech perception with large language models (LLMs), often degrading textual capabilities due to speech-centric training. Existing benchmarks conflate speech perception with instruction-following, hindering evaluation of these distinct skills. To address this gap, we provide a benchmark for diagnosing the instruction-following abilities of SLMs. Our findings show that most SLMs struggle with even basic instructions, performing far worse than text-based LLMs. Additionally, these models are highly sensitive to prompt variations, often yielding inconsistent and unreliable outputs. We highlight core challenges and provide insights to guide future research, emphasizing the need for evaluation beyond task-level metrics.

Title: Movable-Element STARS-Assisted Near-Field Wideband Communications
Authors: Guangyu Zhu, Xidong Mu, Li Guo, Ao Huang, Shibiao Xu
Abstract: A novel movable-element simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (ME-STARS)-assisted near-field wideband communication framework is proposed. In particular, the position of each STARS element can be adjusted to combat the significant wideband beam squint issue in the near field instead of using costly true-time delay components. Four practical ME-STARS element movement modes are proposed, namely region-based (RB), horizontal-based (HB), vertical-based (VB), and diagonal-based (DB) modes. Based on this, a near-field wideband multi-user downlink communication scenario is considered, where a sum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the base station (BS) precoding, ME-STARS beamforming, and element positions. To solve this intractable problem, a two-layer algorithm is developed. For the inner layer, the block coordinate descent optimization framework is utilized to solve the BS precoding and ME-STARS beamforming in an iterative manner. For the outer layer, the particle swarm optimization-based heuristic search method is employed to determine the desired element positions. Numerical results show that:1) the ME-STARSs can effectively address the beam squint for near-field wideband communications compared to conventional STARSs with fixed element positions; 2) the RB mode achieves the most efficient beam squint effect mitigation, while the DB mode achieves the best trade-off between performance gain and hardware overhead; and 3) an increase in the number of ME-STARS elements or BS subcarriers substantially improves the system performance.

Title: An Autocovariance Least-Squares-Based Data-Driven Kalman Filter for Unknown Systems
Authors: Suyang Hu, Xiaoxu Lyu, Peihu Duan, Dawei Shi, Ling Shi
Abstract: This article investigates the problem of data-driven state estimation for linear systems with both unknown system dynamics and noise covariances. We propose an Autocovariance Least-squares-based Data-driven Kalman Filter (ADKF), which provides a unified framework for simultaneous system identification and state estimation by utilizing pre-collected input-output trajectories and estimated initial states. Specifically, we design a SDP-based algorithm for estimating the noise covariances. We quantify the impact of model inaccuracy on noise covariances estimation using this identification algorithm, and introduce a feedback control mechanism for data collection to enhance the accuracy and stability of noise covariance estimation. The estimated noise covariances account for model inaccuracy, which are shown to be more suitable for state estimation. We also quantify the performance gap between the ADKF and the traditional Kalman filter with known system dynamics and noise covariances, showing that this gap decreases as the number and length of pre-collected trajectories increase. Finally, numerical simulations validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed ADKF.

Title: FedORA: Resource Allocation for Federated Learning in ORAN using Radio Intelligent Controllers
Authors: Abdelaziz Salama, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Syed Danial Ali Shah, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Zaidi
Abstract: This work proposes an integrated approach for optimising Federated Learning (FL) communication in dynamic and heterogeneous network environments. Leveraging the modular flexibility of the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) architecture and multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs), we aim to enhance data transmission efficiency and mitigate client-server communication constraints within the FL framework. Our system employs a two-stage optimisation strategy using ORAN's rApps and xApps. In the first stage, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based rApp is used to dynamically select each user's optimal Radio Access Technology (RAT), balancing energy efficiency with network performance. In the second stage, a model-based xApp facilitates near-real-time resource allocation optimisation through predefined policies to achieve optimal network performance. The dynamic RAT selection and resource allocation capabilities enabled by ORAN and multi-RAT contribute to robust communication resilience in dynamic network environments. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance with low power consumption compared to other state-of-the-art models, showcasing its potential for real-time applications demanding both accuracy and efficiency. This robust and comprehensive framework, enabling clients to utilise available resources effectively, highlights the potential for scalable, collaborative learning applications prioritising energy efficiency and network performance.

Title: MedITok: A Unified Tokenizer for Medical Image Synthesis and Interpretation
Authors: Chenglong Ma, Yuanfeng Ji, Jin Ye, Zilong Li, Chenhui Wang, Junzhi Ning, Wei Li, Lihao Liu, Qiushan Guo, Tianbin Li, Junjun He, Hongming Shan
Abstract: Advanced autoregressive models have reshaped multimodal AI. However, their transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image synthesis, as well as rich semantics for accurate diagnosis and image interpretation. To this end, we present MedITok, the first unified tokenizer tailored for medical images, encoding both low-level structural details and high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 30 datasets across 9 imaging modalities and 4 different tasks. By providing a unified token space for autoregressive modeling, MedITok supports a wide range of tasks in clinical diagnostics and generative healthcare applications. Model and code will be made publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: SoloSpeech: Enhancing Intelligibility and Quality in Target Speech Extraction through a Cascaded Generative Pipeline
Authors: Helin Wang, Jiarui Hai, Dongchao Yang, Chen Chen, Kai Li, Junyi Peng, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro Velazquez, Jesus Villalba, Najim Dehak
Abstract: Target Speech Extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a target speaker's voice from a mixture of multiple speakers by leveraging speaker-specific cues, typically provided as auxiliary audio (a.k.a. cue audio). Although recent advancements in TSE have primarily employed discriminative models that offer high perceptual quality, these models often introduce unwanted artifacts, reduce naturalness, and are sensitive to discrepancies between training and testing environments. On the other hand, generative models for TSE lag in perceptual quality and intelligibility. To address these challenges, we present SoloSpeech, a novel cascaded generative pipeline that integrates compression, extraction, reconstruction, and correction processes. SoloSpeech features a speaker-embedding-free target extractor that utilizes conditional information from the cue audio's latent space, aligning it with the mixture audio's latent space to prevent mismatches. Evaluated on the widely-used Libri2Mix dataset, SoloSpeech achieves the new state-of-the-art intelligibility and quality in target speech extraction and speech separation tasks while demonstrating exceptional generalization on out-of-domain data and real-world scenarios.

Title: Foundation Model for Wireless Technology Recognition Using IQ Timeseries
Authors: Mohammad Cheraghinia, Eli De Poorter, Jaron Fontaine, Merouane Debbah, Adnan Shahid
Abstract: Wireless Technology Recognition (WTR) is essential in modern communication systems, enabling efficient spectrum management and the seamless coexistence of diverse technologies. In real-world conditions, WTR solutions should be able to handle signals from various resources with different sampling rates, capturing devices, and frequency bands. However, traditional WTR methods, which rely on energy detection, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, or Deep Learning (DL), lack the robustness and adaptability required to generalize across unseen environments, different sampling devices, and previously unencountered signal classes. In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based foundation model for WTR, trained in an unsupervised manner on large-scale, unlabeled wireless signal datasets. Foundation models are designed to learn general-purpose representations that transfer effectively across tasks and domains, allowing generalization towards new technologies and WTR sampling devices. Our approach leverages input patching for computational efficiency and incorporates a two-stage training pipeline: unsupervised pre-training followed by lightweight fine-tuning. This enables the model to generalize to new wireless technologies and environments using only a small number of labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior accuracy across varying sampling rates and frequency bands while maintaining low computational complexity, supporting the vision of a reusable wireless foundation model adaptable to new technologies with minimal retraining.

Title: Stack Less, Repeat More: A Block Reusing Approach for Progressive Speech Enhancement
Authors: Jangyeon Kim, Ui-Hyeop Shin, Jaehyun Ko, Hyung-Min Park
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient speech enhancement (SE) approach that reuses a processing block repeatedly instead of conventional stacking. Rather than increasing the number of blocks for learning deep latent representations, repeating a single block leads to progressive refinement while reducing parameter redundancy. We also minimize domain transformation by keeping an encoder and decoder shallow and reusing a single sequence modeling block. Experimental results show that the number of processing stages is more critical to performance than the number of blocks with different weights. Also, we observed that the proposed method gradually refines a noisy input within a single block. Furthermore, with the block reuse method, we demonstrate that deepening the encoder and decoder can be redundant for learning deep complex representation. Therefore, the experimental results confirm that the proposed block reusing enables progressive learning and provides an efficient alternative for SE.

Title: Leveraging Cascaded Binary Classification and Multimodal Fusion for Dementia Detection through Spontaneous Speech
Authors: Yin-Long Liu, Yuanchao Li, Rui Feng, Liu He, Jia-Xin Chen, Yi-Ming Wang, Yu-Ang Chen, Yan-Han Peng, Jia-Hong Yuan, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the PROCESS Challenge 2025, focusing on spontaneous speech analysis for early dementia detection. For the three-class classification task (Healthy Control, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia), we propose a cascaded binary classification framework that fine-tunes pre-trained language models and incorporates pause encoding to better capture disfluencies. This design streamlines multi-class classification and addresses class imbalance by restructuring the decision process. For the Mini-Mental State Examination score regression task, we develop an enhanced multimodal fusion system that combines diverse acoustic and linguistic features. Separate regression models are trained on individual feature sets, with ensemble learning applied through score averaging. Experimental results on the test set outperform the baselines provided by the organizers in both tasks, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

Title: A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images
Authors: Hengtong Shen, Haiyan Gu, Haitao Li, Yi Yang, Agen qiu
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.

Title: Beyond Manual Transcripts: The Potential of Automated Speech Recognition Errors in Improving Alzheimer's Disease Detection
Authors: Yin-Long Liu, Rui Feng, Jia-Xin Chen, Yi-Ming Wang, Jia-Hong Yuan, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have enabled fully automated Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using ASR transcripts. Nonetheless, the impact of ASR errors on AD detection remains poorly understood. This paper fills the gap. We conduct a comprehensive study on AD detection using transcripts from various ASR models and their synthesized speech on the ADReSS dataset. Experimental results reveal that certain ASR transcripts (ASR-synthesized speech) outperform manual transcripts (manual-synthesized speech) in detection accuracy, suggesting that ASR errors may provide valuable cues for improving AD detection. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based interpretability model that not only identifies these cues but also achieves superior or comparable performance to the baseline. Furthermore, we utilize this model to unveil AD-related patterns within pre-trained embeddings. Our study offers novel insights into the potential of ASR models for AD detection.

Title: VoiceStar: Robust Zero-Shot Autoregressive TTS with Duration Control and Extrapolation
Authors: Puyuan Peng, Shang-Wen Li, Abdelrahman Mohamed, David Harwath
Abstract: We present VoiceStar, the first zero-shot TTS model that achieves both output duration control and extrapolation. VoiceStar is an autoregressive encoder-decoder neural codec language model, that leverages a novel Progress-Monitoring Rotary Position Embedding (PM-RoPE) and is trained with Continuation-Prompt Mixed (CPM) training. PM-RoPE enables the model to better align text and speech tokens, indicates the target duration for the generated speech, and also allows the model to generate speech waveforms much longer in duration than those seen during. CPM training also helps to mitigate the training/inference mismatch, and significantly improves the quality of the generated speech in terms of speaker similarity and intelligibility. VoiceStar outperforms or is on par with current state-of-the-art models on short-form benchmarks such as Librispeech and Seed-TTS, and significantly outperforms these models on long-form/extrapolation benchmarks (20-50s) in terms of intelligibility and naturalness.

Title: FlowSE: Efficient and High-Quality Speech Enhancement via Flow Matching
Authors: Ziqian Wang, Zikai Liu, Xinfa Zhu, Yike Zhu, Mingshuai Liu, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Lei Xie
Abstract: Generative models have excelled in audio tasks using approaches such as language models, diffusion, and flow matching. However, existing generative approaches for speech enhancement (SE) face notable challenges: language model-based methods suffer from quantization loss, leading to compromised speaker similarity and intelligibility, while diffusion models require complex training and high inference latency. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSE, a flow-matching-based model for SE. Flow matching learns a continuous transformation between noisy and clean speech distributions in a single pass, significantly reducing inference latency while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Specifically, FlowSE trains on noisy mel spectrograms and optional character sequences, optimizing a conditional flow matching loss with ground-truth mel spectrograms as supervision. It implicitly learns speech's temporal-spectral structure and text-speech alignment. During inference, FlowSE can operate with or without textual information, achieving impressive results in both scenarios, with further improvements when transcripts are available. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowSE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative methods, establishing a new paradigm for generative-based SE and demonstrating the potential of flow matching to advance the field. Our code, pre-trained checkpoints, and audio samples are available.

Title: Empirical 3D Channel Modeling for Cellular-Connected UAVs: A Triple-Layer Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Haider A.H. Alobaidy, Mehran Behjati, Rosdiadee Nordin, Muhammad Aidiel Zulkifley, Nor Fadzilah Abdullah, Nur Fahimah Mat Salleh
Abstract: This work proposes an empirical air to ground (A2G) propagation model specifically designed for cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). An in depth aerial drive test was carried out within an operating Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, gathering thorough measurements of key network parameters. Rigid preprocessing and statistical analysis of these data produced a strong foundation for training a new triple layer machine learning (ML) model. The proposed ML framework employs a systematic hierarchical approach. Accordingly, the first two layers, Stepwise Linear Regression (STW) and Ensemble of Bagged Trees (EBT) generate predictions independently, meanwhile, the third layer, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), explicitly acts as an aggregation layer, refining these predictions to accurately estimate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ), Received Signal Strength (RSSI), and Path Loss (PL). Compared to traditional single layer ML or computationally intensive ray tracing approaches, the proposed triple layer ML framework significantly improves predictive accuracy and robustness, achieving around 99 percent accuracy in training and above 90 percent in testing while utilizing a minimal but effective feature set log transformed 3D and 2D propagation distances, azimuth, and elevation angles. This streamlined feature selection substantially reduces computing complexity, thus enhancing scalability across various operating environments. The proposed frameworks practicality and efficacy for real world deployment in UAV integrated cellular networks are further demonstrated by comparative analyses, which underscore its substantial improvement.

Title: VLMLight: Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning
Authors: Maonan Wang, Yirong Chen, Aoyu Pang, Yuxin Cai, Chung Shue Chen, Yuheng Kan, Man-On Pun
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.

Title: Synchronous Models and Fundamental Systems in Observer Design
Authors: Pieter van Goor, Robert Mahony
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a synchronous model as an extension of the internal model concept used in observer design for dynamical systems. A system is said to contain a synchronous model of another if there is a suitable error function between the two systems that remains stationary for all of the trajectories of the two systems. A system is said to admit a synchronous lift if a second system containing a synchronous model exists. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions that a system admits a synchronous lift and provide a method to construct a (there may be many) lifted system should one exist. We characterise the class of all systems that admit a synchronous lift by showing that they consist of fundamental vector fields induced by a Lie group action, a class of system we term fundamental systems. For fundamental systems we propose a simple synchronous observer design methodology, for which we show how correction terms can be discretised and combined easily, facilitating global characterisation of convergence and performance. Finally, we provide three examples to demonstrate the key concepts of synchrony, symmetry construction, and observer design for a fundamental system.

Title: Near-Field Secure Beamfocusing With Receiver-Centered Protected Zone
Authors: Cen Liu, Xiangyun Zhou, Nan Yang, Salman Durrani, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: This work studies near-field secure communications through transmit beamfocusing. We examine the benefit of having a protected eavesdropper-free zone around the legitimate receiver, and we determine the worst-case secrecy performance against a potential eavesdropper located anywhere outside the protected zone. A max-min optimization problem is formulated for the beamfocusing design with and without artificial noise transmission. Despite the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop a synchronous gradient descent-ascent framework that approximates the global maximin solution. A low-complexity solution is also derived that delivers excellent performance over a wide range of operating conditions. We further extend this study to a scenario where it is not possible to physically enforce a protected zone. To this end, we consider secure communications through the creation of a virtual protected zone using a full-duplex legitimate receiver. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting either the physical or virtual receiver-centered protected zone with appropriately designed beamfocusing is an effective strategy for achieving secure near-field communications.

Title: Water Level Sensing via Communication Signals in a Bi-Static System
Authors: Zhongqin Wang, J. Andrew Zhang, Kai Wu, Y. Jay Guo
Abstract: Accurate water level sensing is essential for flood monitoring, agricultural irrigation, and water resource optimization. Traditional methods require dedicated sensor deployments, leading to high installation costs, vulnerability to interference, and limited resolution. This work proposes PMNs-WaterSense, a novel scheme leveraging Channel State Information (CSI) from existing mobile networks for water level sensing. Our scheme begins with a CSI-power method to eliminate phase offsets caused by clock asynchrony in bi-static systems. We then apply multi-domain filtering across the time (Doppler), frequency (delay), and spatial (Angle-of-Arrival, AoA) domains to extract phase features that finely capture variations in path length over water. To resolve the $2\pi$ phase ambiguity, we introduce a Kalman filter-based unwrapping technique. Additionally, we exploit transceiver geometry to convert path length variations into water level height changes, even with limited antenna configurations. We validate our framework through controlled experiments with 28 GHz mmWave and 3.1 GHz LTE signals in real time, achieving average height estimation errors of 0.025 cm and 0.198 cm, respectively. Moreover, real-world river monitoring with 2.6 GHz LTE signals achieves an average error of 4.8 cm for a 1-meter water level change, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical deployments.

Title: Customising Electricity Contracts at Scale with Large Language Models
Authors: Jochen L. Cremer
Abstract: The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLM) in chats at scale. The LLM-based chat has direct access to a model of the grid and studies the grid's technical constraints just as an expert engineer. The advantage of this system is that end-users can directly interact with grid models through natural language; no intermediate is needed to service, analyse, study, assess, advise, consult and engineer. This initial study paves the way toward developing this tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.

Title: Mel-McNet: A Mel-Scale Framework for Online Multichannel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Yujie Yang, Bing Yang, Xiaofei Li
Abstract: Online multichannel speech enhancement has been intensively studied recently. Though Mel-scale frequency is more matched with human auditory perception and computationally efficient than linear frequency, few works are implemented in a Mel-frequency domain. To this end, this work proposes a Mel-scale framework (namely Mel-McNet). It processes spectral and spatial information with two key components: an effective STFT-to-Mel module compressing multi-channel STFT features into Mel-frequency representations, and a modified McNet backbone directly operating in the Mel domain to generate enhanced LogMel spectra. The spectra can be directly fed to vocoders for waveform reconstruction or ASR systems for transcription. Experiments on CHiME-3 show that Mel-McNet can reduce computational complexity by 60% while maintaining comparable enhancement and ASR performance to the original McNet. Mel-McNet also outperforms other SOTA methods, verifying the potential of Mel-scale speech enhancement.

Title: MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous Decoding
Authors: Yu Xi, Haoyu Li, Xiaoyu Gu, Yidi Jiang, Kai Yu
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.

Title: Accelerating Diffusion-based Text-to-Speech Model Training with Dual Modality Alignment
Authors: Jeongsoo Choi, Zhikang Niu, Ji-Hoon Kim, Chunhui Wang, Joon Son Chung, Chen Xie
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to optimize the training process of diffusion-based text-to-speech models. While recent studies have achieved remarkable advancements, their training demands substantial time and computational costs, largely due to the implicit guidance of diffusion models in learning complex intermediate representations. To address this, we propose A-DMA, an effective strategy for Accelerating training with Dual Modality Alignment. Our method introduces a novel alignment pipeline leveraging both text and speech modalities: text-guided alignment, which incorporates contextual representations, and speech-guided alignment, which refines semantic representations. By aligning hidden states with discriminative features, our training scheme reduces the reliance on diffusion models for learning complex representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A-DMA doubles the convergence speed while achieving superior performance over baselines. Code and demo samples are available at: this https URL

Title: A Lightweight Hybrid Dual Channel Speech Enhancement System under Low-SNR Conditions
Authors: Zheng Wang, Xiaobin Rong, Yu Sun, Tianchi Sun, Zhibin Lin, Jing Lu
Abstract: Although deep learning based multi-channel speech enhancement has achieved significant advancements, its practical deployment is often limited by constrained computational resources, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight hybrid dual-channel speech enhancement system that combines independent vector analysis (IVA) with a modified version of the dual-channel grouped temporal convolutional recurrent network (GTCRN). IVA functions as a coarse estimator, providing auxiliary information for both speech and noise, while the modified GTCRN further refines the speech quality. We investigate several modifications to ensure the comprehensive utilization of both original and auxiliary information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, achieving enhanced speech with minimal parameters and low computational complexity.

Title: Range Space or Null Space: Least-Squares Methods for the Realization Problem
Authors: Jiabao He, Yueyue Xu, Yue Ju, Cristian R. Rojas, Håkan Hjalmarsson
Abstract: This contribution revisits the classical approximate realization problem, which involves determining matrices of a state-space model based on estimates of a truncated series of Markov parameters. A Hankel matrix built up by these Markov parameters plays a fundamental role in this problem, leveraging the fact that both its range space and left null space encode critical information about the state-space model. We examine two prototype realization algorithms based on the Hankel matrix: the classical range-space-based (SVD-based) method and the more recent null-space-based method. It is demonstrated that the range-space-based method corresponds to a total least-squares solution, whereas the null-space-based method corresponds to an ordinary least-squares solution. By analyzing the differences in sensitivity of the two algorithms, we determine the conditions when one or the other realization algorithm is to be preferred, and identify factors that contribute to an ill-conditioned realization problem. Furthermore, recognizing that both methods are suboptimal, we argue that the optimal realization is obtained through a weighted least-squares approach. A statistical analysis of these methods, including their consistency and asymptotic normality is also provided.

Title: Accurate Radar-Based Detection of Sleep Apnea Using Overlapping Time-Interval Averaging
Authors: Kodai Hasegawa, Shigeaki Okumura, Hirofumi Taki, Hironobu Sunadome, Satoshi Hamada, Susumu Sato, Kazuo Chin, Takuya Sakamoto
Abstract: Radar-based respiratory measurement is a promising tool for the noncontact detection of sleep apnea. Our team has reported that apnea events can be accurately detected using the statistical characteristics of the amplitude of respiratory displacement. However, apnea and hypopnea events are often followed by irregular breathing, reducing the detection accuracy. This study proposes a new method to overcome this performance degradation by repeatedly applying the detection method to radar data sets corresponding to multiple overlapping time intervals. Averaging the detected classes over multiple time intervals gives an analog value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability that there is an apnea event. We show that the proposed method can mitigate the effect of irregular breathing that occurs after apnea / hypopnea events, and its performance is confirmed by experimental data taken from seven patients.

Title: Scalable quantile predictions of peak loads for non-residential customer segments
Authors: Shaohong Shi, Jacco Heres, Simon H. Tindemans
Abstract: Electrical grid congestion has emerged as an immense challenge in Europe, making the forecasting of load and its associated metrics increasingly crucial. Among these metrics, peak load is fundamental. Non-time-resolved models of peak load have their advantages of being simple and compact, and among them Velander's formula (VF) is widely used in distribution network planning. However, several aspects of VF remain inadequately addressed, including year-ahead prediction, scaling of customers, aggregation, and, most importantly, the lack of probabilistic elements. The present paper proposes a quantile interpretation of VF that enables VF to learn truncated cumulative distribution functions of peak loads with multiple quantile regression under non-crossing constraints. The evaluations on non-residential customer data confirmed its ability to predict peak load year ahead, to fit customers with a wide range of electricity consumptions, and to model aggregations of customers. A noteworthy finding is that for a given electricity consumption, aggregations of customers have statistically larger peak loads than a single customer.

Title: Navigating PESQ: Up-to-Date Versions and Open Implementations
Authors: Matteo Torcoli, Mhd Modar Halimeh, Emanuël A. P. Habets
Abstract: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) is an objective quality measure that remains widely used despite its withdrawal by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). PESQ has evolved over two decades, with multiple versions and publicly available implementations emerging during this time. The numerous versions and their updates can be overwhelming, especially for new PESQ users. This work provides practical guidance on the different versions and implementations of PESQ. We show that differences can be significant, especially between PESQ versions. We stress the importance of specifying the exact version and implementation that is used to compute PESQ, and possibly to detail how multi-channel signals are handled. These practices would facilitate the interpretation of results and allow comparisons of PESQ scores between different studies. We also provide a repository that implements the latest corrections to PESQ, i.e., Corrigendum 2, which is not implemented by any other openly available distribution: this https URL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech encoders have drawn attention due to their integration with Large Language Models for various speech tasks. While most research has focused on either causal or full-context speech encoders, there's limited exploration to effectively handle both streaming and non-streaming applications, while achieving state-of-the-art performance. We introduce DuRep, a Dual-mode Speech Representation learning setup, which enables a single speech encoder to function efficiently in both offline and online modes without additional parameters or mode-specific adjustments, across downstream tasks. DuRep-200M, our 200M parameter dual-mode encoder, achieves 12% and 11.6% improvements in streaming and non-streaming modes, over baseline encoders on Multilingual ASR. Scaling this approach to 2B parameters, DuRep-2B sets new performance benchmarks across ASR and non-ASR tasks. Our analysis reveals interesting trade-offs between acoustic and semantic information across encoder layers.

Authors: Mobina Mansoori, Sajjad Shahabodini, Farnoush Bayatmakou, Jamshid Abouei, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Arash Mohammadi
Abstract: Using massive datasets, foundation models are large-scale, pre-trained models that perform a wide range of tasks. These models have shown consistently improved results with the introduction of new methods. It is crucial to analyze how these trends impact the medical field and determine whether these advancements can drive meaningful change. This study investigates the application of recent state-of-the-art foundation models, DINOv2, MAE, VMamba, CoCa, SAM2, and AIMv2, for medical image classification. We explore their effectiveness on datasets including CBIS-DDSM for mammography, ISIC2019 for skin lesions, APTOS2019 for diabetic retinopathy, and CHEXPERT for chest radiographs. By fine-tuning these models and evaluating their configurations, we aim to understand the potential of these advancements in medical image classification. The results indicate that these advanced models significantly enhance classification outcomes, demonstrating robust performance despite limited labeled data. Based on our results, AIMv2, DINOv2, and SAM2 models outperformed others, demonstrating that progress in natural domain training has positively impacted the medical domain and improved classification outcomes.

Title: Deep learning based spatial aliasing reduction in beamforming for audio capture
Authors: Mateusz Guzik, Giulio Cengarle, Daniel Arteaga
Abstract: Spatial aliasing affects spaced microphone arrays, causing directional ambiguity above certain frequencies, degrading spatial and spectral accuracy of beamformers. Given the limitations of conventional signal processing and the scarcity of deep learning approaches to spatial aliasing mitigation, we propose a novel approach using a U-Net architecture to predict a signal-dependent de-aliasing filter, which reduces aliasing in conventional beamforming for spatial capture. Two types of multichannel filters are considered, one which treats the channels independently and a second one that models cross-channel dependencies. The proposed approach is evaluated in two common spatial capture scenarios: stereo and first-order Ambisonics. The results indicate a very significant improvement, both objective and perceptual, with respect to conventional beamforming. This work shows the potential of deep learning to reduce aliasing in beamforming, leading to improvements in multi-microphone setups.

Title: Chance-constrained Solar PV Hosting Capacity Assessment for Distribution Grids Using Gaussian Process and Logit Learning
Authors: Sel Ly, Anshuman Singh, Petr Vorobev, Yeng Chai Soh, Hung Dinh Nguyen
Abstract: Growing penetration of distributed generation such as solar PV can increase the risk of over-voltage in distribution grids, affecting network security. Therefore, assessment of the so-called, PV hosting capacity (HC) - the maximum amount of PV that a given grid can accommodate becomes an important practical problem. In this paper, we propose a novel chance-constrained HC estimation framework using Gaussian Process and Logit learning that can account for uncertainty and risk management. Also, we consider the assessment of HC under different voltage control strategies. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed models can achieve high accuracy levels of up to 93% in predicting nodal over-voltage events on IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test-cases. Thus, these models can be effectively employed to estimate the chance-constrained HC with various risk levels. Moreover, our proposed methods have simple forms and low computational costs of only a few seconds.

Title: Bit Error Rate and Performance Analysis of Multi-User OTFS under Nakagami-m Fading for 6G and Beyond Networks
Authors: Emir Aslandogan, Haci Ilhan
Abstract: Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space modulation stands out as a promising waveform for 6G and beyond wireless communication systems, offering superior performance over conventional methods, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and dispersive channel conditions. Error performance analysis remains crucial for accurately characterizing the reliability of wireless communication systems under practical constraints. In this paper, we systematically investigate the bit error rate performance of OTFS modulation over Nakagami-m fading channels in both single-user and multi-user scenarios. In analytical approaches, mathematical frameworks are employed for distinct receiver configurations: the Single-input Single-output scenario leverages Erlang probability density function of squared-Nakagami variables to derive closed-form BER expressions, while the Single-input Multiple-output case applies moment matching techniques with Gamma approximation to model multiple user interference, subsequently yielding Signal-to-interference-plus-noise Ratio characterizations through Meijer-G functions. This study examines single-path and multi-path channel conditions, evaluating the relationship between path multiplicity and error performance metrics while considering various fading intensities through Nakagami-m fading parameters. The derived closed-form BER expressions are validated through maximum likelihood detection based Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating strong correlation between analytical and numerical results across various SNR regions. Furthermore, comparative benchmark evaluations against conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with MLD reveal that OTFS consistently achieves superior error performance in high-mobility scenarios. In multipath fading environments, OTFS achieves superior diversity gain compared to conventional OFDM, which refers to enhanced error performance.

Title: Power allocation for cell-free MIMO integrated sensing and communication
Authors: Guoqing Xia, Pei Xiao, Qu Luo, Bing Ji, Yue Zhang, Huiyu Zhou
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in a cell-free (CF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network with single-antenna access points (APs), where each AP functions either as a transmitter for both sensing and communication or as a receiver for target-reflected signals. We derive closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for location and velocity estimation under arbitrary power allocation ratios, assuming the radar cross-section (RCS) is deterministic and unknown over the observation interval. A power allocation optimization problem is formulated to maximize the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), subject to CRLB-based sensing constraints and per-transmitter power limits. To solve the resulting nonlinear and non-convex problem, we propose a penalty function and projection-based modified conjugate gradient algorithm with inexact line search (PP-MCG-ILS), and an alternative method based on a modified steepest descent approach (PP-MSD-ILS). Additionally, for power minimization in pure sensing scenarios, we introduce a penalty function-based normalized conjugate gradient algorithm (P-NCG-ILS). We analyze the convergence behavior and qualitatively compare the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived CRLBs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation strategies in enhancing both sensing and overall ISAC performance.

Title: A fully automated urban PV parameterization framework for improved estimation of energy production profiles
Authors: Bowen Tian, Roel C.G.M. Loonen, Roland Valckenborg, Jan L.M. Hensen
Abstract: Accurate parameterization of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations is critical for effective grid management and strategic large-scale solar deployment. The lack of high-fidelity datasets for PV configuration parameters often compels practitioners to rely on coarse assumptions, undermining both the temporal and numerical accuracy of large-scale PV performance modeling. This study introduces a fully automated framework that innovatively integrates remote sensing data, semantic segmentation, polygon-vector refinement, tilt-azimuth estimation, and module layout inference to produce a richly attributed GIS dataset of distributed PV. Applied to Eindhoven (the Netherlands), the method achieves a correlation ($R^2$) of 0.92 with Distribution System Operator (DSO) records, while capacity estimates for 73$\%$ of neighborhoods demonstrate agreement within a $\pm$25$\%$ margin of recorded data. Additionally, by accurately capturing actual system configuration parameters (e.g., tilt, azimuth, module layout) and seamlessly linking them to advanced performance models, the method yields more reliable PV energy generation forecasts within the distribution networks. Centering our experiments toward a high PV-penetration community, configuration-aware simulations help to reduce Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of energy generation modeling by up to 160$\%$ compared to the conventional assumption-based approaches. Furthermore, owing to its modular design and reliance on readily available geospatial resources, the workflow can be extended across diverse regions, offering a scalable solution for robust urban solar integration.

Title: Optimizing Offshore Wind Integration through Multi-Terminal DC Grids: A Market-Based OPF Framework for the North Sea Interconnectors
Authors: Bernardo Castro Valerio, Vinícius Albernaz Lacerda, Marc Cheah-Mañe, Pieter Gebraad, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt
Abstract: Interconnecting price zones and remote renewable energy sources has emerged as a key solution to achieving climate goals. The objective of this work is to present a formulation that extends the base optimal power flow model with price zones constraints to forecast the operations of upcoming offshore wind developments integrated into a multi-terminal DC grid. A case study based on the 2030 development of the North Sea is used to exemplify the utilization of the formulation. Here, three cases are presented, one with the price as a parameter and the other two with the price as a variable dependent on power flows between price zones. The paper demonstrates that, for large power flows, it is necessary to include additional constraints beyond line limitations to accurately capture the effects of price zone exchanges.

Title: OFDMA for Pinching Antenna Systems
Authors: Thrassos K. Oikonomou, Sotiris A. Tegos, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Yuanwei Liu, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: Pinching-antenna (PA) systems route millimeter wave (mmWave) signals through a leaky waveguide and radiate them at "pinch" apertures, offering low-cost line-of-sight (LoS) coverage. However, when multiple PAs serve multiple users simultaneously, the downlink channel becomes strongly frequency-selective, creating inter-symbol interference (ISI) that existing single-carrier designs overlook. This paper models the overall channel as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, characterizes its frequency selectivity, and explicitly accounts for the resulting ISI. To overcome ISI, we introduce an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based framework and formulate a max-min resource-allocation problem to achieve user fairness. A lightweight two-stage heuristic-greedy subcarrier assignment, followed by per-user water-filling, achieves near-optimal fairness with polynomial complexity. Simulation results for an indoor layout demonstrate that the proposed scheme notably increases the minimum user rate compared to time-division single-carrier baselines and remains robust under moderate LoS blockage.

Title: Persistently Exciting Online Feedback Optimization Controller with Minimal Perturbations
Authors: Tore Gude, Marta Anna Zagorowska, Lars Struen Imsland
Abstract: This paper develops a persistently exciting input generating Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller that estimates the sensitivity of a process ensuring minimal deviations from the descent direction while converging. This eliminates the need for random perturbations in feedback loop. The proposed controller is formulated as a bilevel optimization program, where a nonconvex full rank constraint is relaxed using linear constraints and penalization. The validation of the method is performed in a simulated scenario where multiple systems share a limited, costly resource for production optimization, simulating an oil and gas resource allocation problem. The method allows for less input perturbations while accurately estimating gradients, allowing faster convergence when the gradients are unknown. In the case study, the proposed method achieved the same profit compared to an OFO controller with random input perturbations, and $1.4\%$ higher profit compared to an OFO controller without input perturbations.

Title: Accelerating Flow-Matching-Based Text-to-Speech via Empirically Pruned Step Sampling
Authors: Qixi Zheng, Yushen Chen, Zhikang Niu, Ziyang Ma, Xiaofei Wang, Kai Yu, Xie Chen
Abstract: Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models, such as Voicebox, E2 TTS, and F5-TTS, have attracted significant attention in recent years. These models require multiple sampling steps to reconstruct speech from noise, making inference speed a key challenge. Reducing the number of sampling steps can greatly improve inference efficiency. To this end, we introduce Fast F5-TTS, a training-free approach to accelerate the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. By inspecting the sampling trajectory of F5-TTS, we identify redundant steps and propose Empirically Pruned Step Sampling (EPSS), a non-uniform time-step sampling strategy that effectively reduces the number of sampling steps. Our approach achieves a 7-step generation with an inference RTF of 0.030 on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, making it 4 times faster than the original F5-TTS while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, EPSS performs well on E2 TTS models, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

Title: Interpretable Augmented Physics-Based Model for Estimation and Tracking
Authors: Ondřej Straka, Jindřich Duník, Pau Closas, Tales Imbiriba
Abstract: State-space estimation and tracking rely on accurate dynamical models to perform well. However, obtaining an vaccurate dynamical model for complex scenarios or adapting to changes in the system poses challenges to the estimation process. Recently, augmented physics-based models (APBMs) appear as an appealing strategy to cope with these challenges where the composition of a small and adaptive neural network with known physics-based models (PBM) is learned on the fly following an augmented state-space estimation approach. A major issue when introducing data-driven components in such a scenario is the danger of compromising the meaning (or interpretability) of estimated states. In this work, we propose a novel constrained estimation strategy that constrains the APBM dynamics close to the PBM. The novel state-space constrained approach leads to more flexible ways to impose constraints than the traditional APBM approach. Our experiments with a radar-tracking scenario demonstrate different aspects of the proposed approach and the trade-offs inherent in the imposed constraints.

Title: Efficient Gaussian Mixture Filters based on Transition Density Approximation
Authors: Ondŕej Straka, Uwe D. Hanebeck
Abstract: Gaussian mixture filters for nonlinear systems usually rely on severe approximations when calculating mixtures in the prediction and filtering step. Thus, offline approximations of noise densities by Gaussian mixture densities to reduce the approximation error have been proposed. This results in exponential growth in the number of components, requiring ongoing component reduction, which is computationally complex. In this paper, the key idea is to approximate the true transition density by an axis-aligned Gaussian mixture, where two different approaches are derived. These approximations automatically ensure a constant number of components in the posterior densities without the need for explicit reduction. In addition, they allow a trade-off between estimation quality and computational complexity.

Title: Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Through Cross Modal Attention Alignment and Balanced Stacking Model
Authors: Lucas Ueda, João Lima, Leonardo Marques, Paula Costa
Abstract: Emotion plays a fundamental role in human interaction, and therefore systems capable of identifying emotions in speech are crucial in the context of human-computer interaction. Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging problem, particularly in natural speech and when the available data is imbalanced across emotions. This paper presents our proposed system in the context of the 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge. Our proposed architecture leverages cross-modality, utilizing cross-modal attention to fuse representations from different modalities. To address class imbalance, we employed two training designs: (i) weighted crossentropy loss (WCE); and (ii) WCE with an additional neutralexpressive soft margin loss and balancing. We trained a total of 12 multimodal models, which were ensembled using a balanced stacking model. Our proposed system achieves a MacroF1 score of 0.4094 and an accuracy of 0.4128 on 8-class speech emotion recognition.

Title: MVP: Multi-source Voice Pathology detection
Authors: Alkis Koudounas, Moreno La Quatra, Gabriele Ciravegna, Marco Fantini, Erika Crosetti, Giovanni Succo, Tania Cerquitelli, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Elena Baralis
Abstract: Voice disorders significantly impact patient quality of life, yet non-invasive automated diagnosis remains under-explored due to both the scarcity of pathological voice data, and the variability in recording sources. This work introduces MVP (Multi-source Voice Pathology detection), a novel approach that leverages transformers operating directly on raw voice signals. We explore three fusion strategies to combine sentence reading and sustained vowel recordings: waveform concatenation, intermediate feature fusion, and decision-level combination. Empirical validation across the German, Portuguese, and Italian languages shows that intermediate feature fusion using transformers best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types. Our approach achieves up to +13% AUC improvement over single-source methods.

Title: LPCM: Learning-based Predictive Coding for LiDAR Point Cloud Compression
Authors: Chang Sun, Hui Yuan, Shiqi Jiang, Da Ai, Wei Zhang, Raouf Hamzaoui
Abstract: Since the data volume of LiDAR point clouds is very huge, efficient compression is necessary to reduce their storage and transmission costs. However, existing learning-based compression methods do not exploit the inherent angular resolution of LiDAR and ignore the significant differences in the correlation of geometry information at different bitrates. The predictive geometry coding method in the geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC) standard uses the inherent angular resolution to predict the azimuth angles. However, it only models a simple linear relationship between the azimuth angles of neighboring points. Moreover, it does not optimize the quantization parameters for residuals on each coordinate axis in the spherical coordinate system. We propose a learning-based predictive coding method (LPCM) with both high-bitrate and low-bitrate coding modes. LPCM converts point clouds into predictive trees using the spherical coordinate system. In high-bitrate coding mode, we use a lightweight Long-Short-Term Memory-based predictive (LSTM-P) module that captures long-term geometry correlations between different coordinates to efficiently predict and compress the elevation angles. In low-bitrate coding mode, where geometry correlation degrades, we introduce a variational radius compression (VRC) module to directly compress the point radii. Then, we analyze why the quantization of spherical coordinates differs from that of Cartesian coordinates and propose a differential evolution (DE)-based quantization parameter selection method, which improves rate-distortion performance without increasing coding time. Experimental results on the LiDAR benchmark \textit{SemanticKITTI} and the MPEG-specified \textit{Ford} datasets show that LPCM outperforms G-PCC and other learning-based methods.

Title: On the Robustness of RSMA to Adversarial BD-RIS-Induced Interference
Authors: Arthur S. de Sena, Jacek Kibilda, Nurul H. Mahmood, Andre Gomes, Luiz A. DaSilva, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to interference attacks against channel acquisition induced by beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs). Two primary attack strategies, random and aligned interference, are proposed for fully connected and group-connected BD-RIS architectures. Valid random reflection coefficients are generated exploiting the Takagi factorization, while potent aligned interference attacks are achieved through optimization strategies based on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) reformulation followed by projections onto the unitary manifold. Our numerical findings reveal that, when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, RSMA behaves similarly to space-division multiple access (SDMA) and thus is highly susceptible to the attack, with BD-RIS inducing severe performance loss and significantly outperforming diagonal RIS. However, under imperfect CSI, RSMA consistently demonstrates significantly greater robustness than SDMA, particularly as the system's transmit power increases.

Title: Improvement Strategies for Few-Shot Learning in OCT Image Classification of Rare Retinal Diseases
Authors: Cheng-Yu Tai, Ching-Wen Chen, Chi-Chin Wu, Bo-Chen Chiu, Cheng-Hung (Dixson)Lin, Cheng-Kai Lu, Jia-Kang Wang, Tzu-Lun Huang
Abstract: This paper focuses on using few-shot learning to improve the accuracy of classifying OCT diagnosis images with major and rare classes. We used the GAN-based augmentation strategy as a baseline and introduced several novel methods to further enhance our model. The proposed strategy contains U-GAT-IT for improving the generative part and uses the data balance technique to narrow down the skew of accuracy between all categories. The best model obtained was built with CBAM attention mechanism and fine-tuned InceptionV3, and achieved an overall accuracy of 97.85%, representing a significant improvement over the original baseline.

Title: From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data
Authors: Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding, reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the development of ALLMs.

Title: Identification of Power System Dynamic Model Parameters using the Fisher Information Matrix
Authors: Dawn Virginillo, Asja Derviškadić, Mario Paolone
Abstract: The expected decrease in system inertia and frequency stability motivates the development and maintenance of dynamic system models by Transmission System Operators. However, some dynamic model parameters can be unavailable due to market unbundling, or inaccurate due to aging infrastructure, non-documented tuning of controllers, or other factors. In this paper, we propose the use of a numerical approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (nFIM) for efficient inference of dynamic model parameters. Thanks to the proposed numerical implementation, the method is scalable to Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) models, which can quickly become computationally complex even for small study systems. Case studies show that the nFIM is coherent with parameter variances of single- and multi-parameter least-squares estimators when applied to an IEEE 9-bus dynamic model with artificial measurements.

Title: Continuous Learning for Children's ASR: Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting with Elastic Weight Consolidation and Synaptic Intelligence
Authors: Edem Ahadzi, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Tomi Kinnunen, Ville Hautamaki
Abstract: In this work, we present the first study addressing automatic speech recognition (ASR) for children in an online learning setting. This is particularly important for both child-centric applications and the privacy protection of minors, where training models with sequentially arriving data is critical. The conventional approach of model fine-tuning often suffers from catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this issue, we explore two established techniques: elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and synaptic intelligence (SI). Using a custom protocol on the MyST corpus, tailored to the online learning setting, we achieve relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 5.21% with EWC and 4.36% with SI, compared to the fine-tuning baseline.

Title: FT-Boosted SV: Towards Noise Robust Speaker Verification for English Speaking Classroom Environments
Authors: Saba Tabatabaee, Jing Liu, Carol Espy-Wilson
Abstract: Creating Speaker Verification (SV) systems for classroom settings that are robust to classroom noises such as babble noise is crucial for the development of AI tools that assist educational environments. In this work, we study the efficacy of finetuning with augmented children datasets to adapt the x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN to classroom environments. We demonstrate that finetuning with augmented children's datasets is powerful in that regard and reduces the Equal Error Rate (EER) of x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models for both classroom datasets and children speech datasets. Notably, this method reduces EER of the ECAPA-TDNN model on average by half (a 5 % improvement) for classrooms in the MPT dataset compared to the ECAPA-TDNN baseline model. The x-vector model shows an 8 % average improvement for classrooms in the NCTE dataset compared to its baseline.

Title: Interpretable Multi-Task PINN for Emotion Recognition and EDA Prediction
Authors: Nischal Mandal
Abstract: Understanding and predicting human emotional and physiological states using wearable sensors has important applications in stress monitoring, mental health assessment, and affective computing. This study presents a novel Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that performs Electrodermal Activity (EDA) prediction and emotion classification simultaneously, using the publicly available WESAD dataset. The model integrates psychological self-report features (PANAS and SAM) with a physics-inspired differential equation representing EDA dynamics, enforcing biophysically grounded constraints through a custom loss function. This loss combines EDA regression, emotion classification, and a physics residual term for improved interpretability. The architecture supports dual outputs for both tasks and is trained under a unified multi-task framework. Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieves an average EDA RMSE of 0.0362, Pearson correlation of 0.9919, and F1-score of 94.08 percent. These results outperform classical models such as SVR and XGBoost, as well as ablated variants like emotion-only and EDA-only models. In addition, the learned physical parameters including decay rate (alpha_0), emotional sensitivity (beta), and time scaling (gamma) are interpretable and stable across folds, aligning with known principles of human physiology. This work is the first to introduce a multi-task PINN framework for wearable emotion recognition, offering improved performance, generalizability, and model transparency. The proposed system provides a foundation for future interpretable and multimodal applications in healthcare and human-computer interaction.

Title: Discovering Interpretable Concepts in Large Generative Music Models
Authors: Nikhil Singh, Manuel Cherep, Pattie Maes
Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned implicit theories of the structure of such content through statistical learning alone. This could offer a novel lens on theories of human-generated media. Where these representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord progressions in music), they demonstrate how these can be inferred from statistical regularities. Where they diverge, they highlight potential limits in our theoretical frameworks -- patterns that we may have overlooked but that nonetheless hold significant explanatory power. In this paper, we focus on the specific case of music generators. We introduce a method to discover musical concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features from the residual stream activations of a transformer model. We evaluate this approach by extracting a large set of features and producing an automatic labeling and evaluation pipeline for them. Our results reveal both familiar musical concepts and counterintuitive patterns that lack clear counterparts in existing theories or natural language altogether. Beyond improving model transparency, our work provides a new empirical tool that might help discover organizing principles in ways that have eluded traditional methods of analysis and synthesis.

Title: Riemannian Flow Matching for Brain Connectivity Matrices via Pullback Geometry
Authors: Antoine Collas, Ce Ju, Nicolas Salvy, Bertrand Thirion
Abstract: Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity matrices lie in constrained spaces--such as the set of symmetric positive definite or correlation matrices--that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds. However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations (geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning, and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from 2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving manifold constraints.

Title: ABHINAYA -- A System for Speech Emotion Recognition In Naturalistic Conditions Challenge
Authors: Soumya Dutta, Smruthi Balaji, Varada R, Viveka Salinamakki, Sriram Ganapathy
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic settings remains a challenge due to the intrinsic variability, diverse recording conditions, and class imbalance. As participants in the Interspeech Naturalistic SER Challenge which focused on these complexities, we present Abhinaya, a system integrating speech-based, text-based, and speech-text models. Our approach fine-tunes self-supervised and speech large language models (SLLM) for speech representations, leverages large language models (LLM) for textual context, and employs speech-text modeling with an SLLM to capture nuanced emotional cues. To combat class imbalance, we apply tailored loss functions and generate categorical decisions through majority voting. Despite one model not being fully trained, the Abhinaya system ranked 4th among 166 submissions. Upon completion of training, it achieved state-of-the-art performance among published results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SER in real-world conditions.

Title: MorphEUS: Morphable Omnidirectional Unmanned System
Authors: Ivan Bao, José C. Díaz Peón González Pacheco, Atharva Navsalkar, Andrew Scheffer, Sashreek Shankar, Andrew Zhao, Hongyu Zhou, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have opened up a wide range of possibilities for inspection, navigation, and manipulation applications using drones. In this paper, we introduce MorphEUS, a morphable co-axial quadrotor that can control position and orientation independently with high efficiency. It uses a paired servo motor mechanism for each rotor arm, capable of pointing the vectored-thrust in any arbitrary direction. As compared to the \textit{state-of-the-art} OMAVs, we achieve higher and more uniform force/torque reachability with a smaller footprint and minimum thrust cancellations. The overactuated nature of the system also results in resiliency to rotor or servo-motor failures. The capabilities of this quadrotor are particularly well-suited for contact-based infrastructure inspection and close-proximity imaging of complex geometries. In the accompanying control pipeline, we present theoretical results for full controllability, almost-everywhere exponential stability, and thrust-energy optimality. We evaluate our design and controller on high-fidelity simulations showcasing the trajectory-tracking capabilities of the vehicle during various tasks. Supplementary details and experimental videos are available on the project webpage.

Title: MPE-TTS: Customized Emotion Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech Using Multi-Modal Prompt
Authors: Zhichao Wu, Yueteng Kang, Songjun Cao, Long Ma, Qiulin Li, Qun Yang
Abstract: Most existing Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech(ZS-TTS) systems generate the unseen speech based on single prompt, such as reference speech or text descriptions, which limits their flexibility. We propose a customized emotion ZS-TTS system based on multi-modal prompt. The system disentangles speech into the content, timbre, emotion and prosody, allowing emotion prompts to be provided as text, image or speech. To extract emotion information from different prompts, we propose a multi-modal prompt emotion encoder. Additionally, we introduce an prosody predictor to fit the distribution of prosody and propose an emotion consistency loss to preserve emotion information in the predicted prosody. A diffusion-based acoustic model is employed to generate the target mel-spectrogram. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our system outperforms existing systems in terms of naturalness and similarity. The samples are available at this https URL.

Abstract: Emotional intelligence in conversational AI is crucial across domains like human-computer interaction. While numerous models have been developed, they often overlook the complexity and ambiguity inherent in human emotions. In the era of large speech foundation models (SFMs), understanding their capability in recognizing ambiguous emotions is essential for the development of next-generation emotion-aware models. This study examines the effectiveness of SFMs in ambiguous emotion recognition. We designed prompts for ambiguous emotion prediction and introduced two novel approaches to infer ambiguous emotion distributions: one analysing generated text responses and the other examining the internal processing of SFMs through token-level logits. Our findings suggest that while SFMs may not consistently generate accurate text responses for ambiguous emotions, they can interpret such emotions at the token level based on prior knowledge, demonstrating robustness across different prompts.

Title: Learning Emotion-Invariant Speaker Representations for Speaker Verification
Authors: Jingguang Tian, Xinhui Hu, Xinkang Xu
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid progress in speaker verification (SV) technology has been driven by the extraction of speaker representations based on deep learning. However, such representations are still vulnerable to emotion variability. To address this issue, we propose multiple improvements to train speaker encoders to increase emotion robustness. Firstly, we utilize CopyPaste-based data augmentation to gather additional parallel data, which includes different emotional expressions from the same speaker. Secondly, we apply cosine similarity loss to restrict parallel sample pairs and minimize intra-class variation of speaker representations to reduce their correlation with emotional information. Finally, we use emotion-aware masking (EM) based on the speech signal energy on the input parallel samples to further strengthen the speaker representation and make it emotion-invariant. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of these various components. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a relative 19.29\% drop in EER compared to the baseline system.

Title: LiSTEN: Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs
Authors: Pooneh Mousavi, Shubham Gupta, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli
Abstract: Foundation models based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in handling various tasks and modalities. However, adapting these models for general-purpose audio-language tasks is challenging due to differences in acoustic environments and task variations. In this work, we introduce LiSTEN Learning Soft Token Embeddings for Neural Audio LLMs), a framework for adapting LLMs to speech and audio tasks. LiSTEN uses a dynamic prompt selection strategy with learnable key-value pairs, allowing the model to balance general and task-specific knowledge while avoiding overfitting in a multitask setting. Our approach reduces dependence on large-scale ASR or captioning datasets, achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters, and simplifies training by using a single-stage process. Additionally, LiSTEN enhances interpretability by analyzing the diversity and overlap of selected prompts across different tasks.

Title: Mechanical in-sensor computing: a programmable meta-sensor for structural damage classification without external electronic power
Authors: Tingpeng Zhang, Xuzhang Peng, Mingyuan Zhou, Guobiao Hu, Zhilu Lai
Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) involves sensor deployment, data acquisition, and data interpretation, commonly implemented via a tedious wired system. The information processing in current practice majorly depends on electronic computers, albeit with universal applications, delivering challenges such as high energy consumption and low throughput due to the nature of digital units. In recent years, there has been a renaissance interest in shifting computations from electronic computing units to the use of real physical systems, a concept known as physical computation. This approach provides the possibility of thinking out of the box for SHM, seamlessly integrating sensing and computing into a pure-physical entity, without relying on external electronic power supplies, thereby properly coping with resource-restricted scenarios. The latest advances of metamaterials (MM) hold great promise for this proactive idea. In this paper, we introduce a programmable metamaterial-based sensor (termed as MM-sensor) for physically processing structural vibration information to perform specific SHM tasks, such as structural damage warning (binary classification) in this initiation, without the need for further information processing or resource-consuming, that is, the data collection and analysis are completed in-situ at the sensor level. We adopt the configuration of a locally resonant metamaterial plate (LRMP) to achieve the first fabrication of the MM-sensor. We take advantage of the bandgap properties of LRMP to physically differentiate the dynamic behavior of structures before and after damage. By inversely designing the geometric parameters, our current approach allows for adjustments to the bandgap features. This is effective for engineering systems with a first natural frequency ranging from 9.54 Hz to 81.86 Hz.

Title: Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles on Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method
Authors: Zehao Wang, Han Zhang, Jingchuan Wang, Weidong Chen
Abstract: In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.

Title: MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation
Authors: Woohyun Cho, Youngmin Kim, Sunghyun Lee, Youngjae Yu
Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.

Title: Simultaneous Optimization of Efficiency and Degradation in Tunable HTL-Free Perovskite Solar Cells with MWCNT-Integrated Back Contact Using a Machine Learning-Derived Polynomial Regressor
Authors: Ihtesham Ibn Malek, Hafiz Imtiaz, Samia Subrina
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without a hole transport layer (HTL) offer a cost-effective and stable alternative to conventional architectures, utilizing only an absorber layer and an electron transport layer (ETL). This study presents a machine learning (ML)-driven framework to optimize the efficiency and stability of HTL-free PSCs by integrating experimental validation with numerical simulations. Excellent agreement is achieved between a fabricated device and its simulated counterpart at a molar fraction \( x = 68.7\% \) in \(\mathrm{MAPb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sb}_{2x/3}\mathrm{I}_3\), where MA is methylammonium. A dataset of 1650 samples is generated by varying molar fraction, absorber defect density, thickness, and ETL doping, with corresponding efficiency and 50-hour degradation as targets. A fourth-degree polynomial regressor (PR-4) shows the best performance, achieving RMSEs of 0.0179 and 0.0117, and \( R^2 \) scores of 1 and 0.999 for efficiency and degradation, respectively. The derived model generalizes beyond the training range and is used in an L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm with a weighted objective function to maximize efficiency and minimize degradation. This improves device efficiency from 13.7\% to 16.84\% and reduces degradation from 6.61\% to 2.39\% over 1000 hours. Finally, the dataset is labeled into superior and inferior classes, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier achieves 100\% accuracy, successfully identifying optimal configurations.

Title: Audio Geolocation: A Natural Sounds Benchmark
Authors: Mustafa Chasmai, Wuao Liu, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn
Abstract: Can we determine someone's geographic location purely from the sounds they hear? Are acoustic signals enough to localize within a country, state, or even city? We tackle the challenge of global-scale audio geolocation, formalize the problem, and conduct an in-depth analysis with wildlife audio from the iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques. We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content. Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and sets the stage for future research in audio geolocation.

Title: Smart Energy Guardian: A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Detecting Fraudulent PV Generation
Authors: Xiaolu Chen, Chenghao Huang, Yanru Zhang, Hao Wang
Abstract: With the proliferation of smart grids, smart cities face growing challenges due to cyber-attacks and sophisticated electricity theft behaviors, particularly in residential photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. Traditional Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an efficient ETD method that accurately identifies fraudulent behaviors in residential PV generation, thus ensuring the supply-demand balance in smart cities. Our hybrid deep learning model, combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy systems in smart cities.

Title: Discrete gradient methods for port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations
Authors: Philipp L. Kinon, Riccardo Morandin, Philipp Schulze
Abstract: Discrete gradient methods are a powerful tool for the time discretization of dynamical systems, since they are structure-preserving regardless of the form of the total energy. In this work, we discuss the application of discrete gradient methods to the system class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations - as they emerge from the port- and energy-based modeling of physical systems in various domains. We introduce a novel numerical scheme tailored for semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations and further address more general settings using the concepts of discrete gradient pairs and Dirac-dissipative structures. Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation. Finally, we present the application to multibody system dynamics and discuss numerical results to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.

Title: Supermartingale Certificates for Quantitative Omega-regular Verification and Control
Authors: Thomas A. Henzinger (1), Kaushik Mallik (2), Pouya Sadeghi (3), Đorđe Žikelić (3) ((1) Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), (2) IMDEA Software Institute, (3) Singapore Management University)
Abstract: We present the first supermartingale certificate for quantitative $\omega$-regular properties of discrete-time infinite-state stochastic systems. Our certificate is defined on the product of the stochastic system and a limit-deterministic Büchi automaton that specifies the property of interest; hence we call it a limit-deterministic Büchi supermartingale (LDBSM). Previously known supermartingale certificates applied only to quantitative reachability, safety, or reach-avoid properties, and to qualitative (i.e., probability 1) $\omega$-regular properties. We also present fully automated algorithms for the template-based synthesis of LDBSMs, for the case when the stochastic system dynamics and the controller can be represented in terms of polynomial inequalities. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to solve verification and control tasks for stochastic systems that were beyond the reach of previous supermartingale-based approaches.

Title: ALPCAHUS: Subspace Clustering for Heteroscedastic Data
Authors: Javier Salazar Cavazos, Jeffrey A Fessler, Laura Balzano
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that come from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-focused subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms. Code available at this https URL.

Title: Improving Anomalous Sound Detection through Pseudo-anomalous Set Selection and Pseudo-label Utilization under Unlabeled Conditions
Authors: Ibuki Kuroyanagi, Takuya Fujimura, Kazuya Takeda, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: This paper addresses performance degradation in anomalous sound detection (ASD) when neither sufficiently similar machine data nor operational state labels are available. We present an integrated pipeline that combines three complementary components derived from prior work and extends them to the unlabeled ASD setting. First, we adapt an anomaly score based selector to curate external audio data resembling the normal sounds of the target machine. Second, we utilize triplet learning to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, enabling finer classification of operational sounds and detection of subtle anomalies. Third, we employ iterative training to refine both the pseudo-anomalous set selection and pseudo-label assignment, progressively improving detection accuracy. Experiments on the DCASE2022-2024 Task 2 datasets demonstrate that, in unlabeled settings, our approach achieves an average AUC increase of over 6.6 points compared to conventional methods. In labeled settings, incorporating external data from the pseudo-anomalous set further boosts performance. These results highlight the practicality and robustness of our methods in scenarios with scarce machine data and labels, facilitating ASD deployment across diverse industrial settings with minimal annotation effort.

Title: Serial-OE: Anomalous sound detection based on serial method with outlier exposure capable of using small amounts of anomalous data for training
Authors: Ibuki Kuroyanagi, Tomoki Hayashi, Kazuya Takeda, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: We introduce Serial-OE, a new approach to anomalous sound detection (ASD) that leverages small amounts of anomalous data to improve the performance. Conventional ASD methods rely primarily on the modeling of normal data, due to the cost of collecting anomalous data from various possible types of equipment breakdowns. Our method improves upon existing ASD systems by implementing an outlier exposure framework that utilizes normal and pseudo-anomalous data for training, with the capability to also use small amounts of real anomalous data. A comprehensive evaluation using the DCASE2020 Task2 dataset shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ASD models. We also investigate the impact on performance of using a small amount of anomalous data during training, of using data without machine ID information, and of using contaminated training data. Our experimental results reveal the potential of using a very limited amount of anomalous data during training to address the limitations of existing methods using only normal data for training due to the scarcity of anomalous data. This study contributes to the field by presenting a method that can be dynamically adapted to include anomalous data during the operational phase of an ASD system, paving the way for more accurate ASD.

Title: Self-supervised learning method using multiple sampling strategies for general-purpose audio representation
Authors: Ibuki Kuroyanagi, Tatsuya Komatsu
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning method using multiple sampling strategies to obtain general-purpose audio representation. Multiple sampling strategies are used in the proposed method to construct contrastive losses from different perspectives and learn representations based on them. In this study, in addition to the widely used clip-level sampling strategy, we introduce two new strategies, a frame-level strategy and a task-specific strategy. The proposed multiple strategies improve the performance of frame-level classification and other tasks like pitch detection, which are not the focus of the conventional single clip-level sampling strategy. We pre-trained the method on a subset of Audioset and applied it to a downstream task with frozen weights. The proposed method improved clip classification, sound event detection, and pitch detection performance by 25%, 20%, and 3.6%.

Title: WHISTRESS: Enriching Transcriptions with Sentence Stress Detection
Authors: Iddo Yosha, Dorin Shteyman, Yossi Adi
Abstract: Spoken language conveys meaning not only through words but also through intonation, emotion, and emphasis. Sentence stress, the emphasis placed on specific words within a sentence, is crucial for conveying speaker intent and has been extensively studied in linguistics. In this work, we introduce WHISTRESS, an alignment-free approach for enhancing transcription systems with sentence stress detection. To support this task, we propose TINYSTRESS-15K, a scalable, synthetic training data for the task of sentence stress detection which resulted from a fully automated dataset creation process. We train WHISTRESS on TINYSTRESS-15K and evaluate it against several competitive baselines. Our results show that WHISTRESS outperforms existing methods while requiring no additional input priors during training or inference. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, WHISTRESS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across diverse benchmarks. Project page: this https URL.

Title: CloneShield: A Framework for Universal Perturbation Against Zero-Shot Voice Cloning
Authors: Renyuan Li, Zhibo Liang, Haichuan Zhang, Tianyu Shi, Zhiyuan Cheng, Jia Shi, Carl Yang, Mingjie Tang
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).

Title: Design of a Wearable Parallel Electrical Impedance Imaging System for Healthcare
Authors: Bowen Li, Zekun Chen, Xuefei Chen, Luhao Zhang, Shili Liang
Abstract: A wireless wearable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system has been developed using the AD5933 for real-time lung respiration imaging. The system uses a current injection method tailored to the human body's impedance characteristics. It applies a voltage excitation and measures the resulting current as the voltage passes through the body. Additionally, measures are taken to suppress the effects of parasitic capacitance, which can lead to signal oscillations and leakage currents. Additionally, to improve data acquisition speed, five AD5933 units are used for parallel measurements, with multiple measures taken to ensure high synchronization during the parallel acquisition process. The results demonstrate conductivity images generated from the EIT system, with data collected from a water tank, human lungs during respiration, and a human calf at rest, confirming that this portable EIT system can measure biological tissues with high precision and low cost.

Title: RIS-Assisted Survivable Fronthaul Design in Cell-Free Massive MIMO System
Authors: Zhenyu Li, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson, Cicek Cavdar
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to improve fronthaul link survivability in cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) systems. To enhance the fronthaul survivability, two complementary mechanisms are considered. Firstly, RIS is set to provide reliable line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity and enhance the mmWave backup link. Secondly, a resource-sharing scheme that leverages redundant cable capacity through neighboring master access points (APs) to guarantee availability is considered. We formulate the redundant capacity minimization problem as a RIS-assisted multi-user MIMO rate control optimization problem, developing a novel solution that combines a modified weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm for precoding design with Riemannian gradient descent for RIS phase shift optimization. Our numerical evaluations show that RIS reduces the required redundant capacity by 65.6% compared to the no RIS case to reach a 99% survivability. The results show that the most substantial gains of RIS occur during complete outages of the direct disconnected master AP-CPU channel. These results demonstrate RIS's potential to significantly enhance fronthaul reliability while minimizing infrastructure costs in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: BR-ASR: Efficient and Scalable Bias Retrieval Framework for Contextual Biasing ASR in Speech LLM
Authors: Xun Gong, Anqi Lv, Zhiming Wang, Huijia Zhu, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: While speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have advanced standard automatic speech recognition (ASR), contextual biasing for named entities and rare words remains challenging, especially at scale. To address this, we propose BR-ASR: a Bias Retrieval framework for large-scale contextual biasing (up to 200k entries) via two innovations: (1) speech-and-bias contrastive learning to retrieve semantically relevant candidates; (2) dynamic curriculum learning that mitigates homophone confusion which negatively impacts the final performance. The is a general framework that allows seamless integration of the retrieved candidates into diverse ASR systems without fine-tuning. Experiments on LibriSpeech test-clean/-other achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) biased word error rates (B-WER) of 2.8%/7.1% with 2000 bias words, delivering 45% relative improvement over prior methods. BR-ASR also demonstrates high scalability: when expanding the bias list to 200k where traditional methods generally fail, it induces only 0.3 / 2.9% absolute WER / B-WER degradation with a 99.99% pruning rate and only 20ms latency per query on test-other.

Title: EnvSDD: Benchmarking Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection
Authors: Han Yin, Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das, Jisheng Bai, Haohe Liu, Wenwu Wang, Mark D Plumbley
Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.

Title: SpeakStream: Streaming Text-to-Speech with Interleaved Data
Authors: Richard He Bai, Zijin Gu, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Navdeep Jaitly
Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.

Title: RAISE: Realness Assessment for Image Synthesis and Evaluation
Authors: Aniruddha Mukherjee, Spriha Dubey, Somdyuti Paul
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.

Title: Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees
Authors: Sourav Ganguly, Arnob Ghosh, Kishan Panaganti, Adam Wierman
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.

Title: Towards a Spatiotemporal Fusion Approach to Precipitation Nowcasting
Authors: Felipe Curcio, Pedro Castro, Augusto Fonseca, Rafaela Castro, Raquel Franco, Eduardo Ogasawara, Victor Stepanenko, Fabio Porto, Mariza Ferro, Eduardo Bezerra
Abstract: With the increasing availability of meteorological data from various sensors, numerical models and reanalysis products, the need for efficient data integration methods has become paramount for improving weather forecasts and hydrometeorological studies. In this work, we propose a data fusion approach for precipitation nowcasting by integrating data from meteorological and rain gauge stations in Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area with ERA5 reanalysis data and GFS numerical weather prediction. We employ the spatiotemporal deep learning architecture called STConvS2S, leveraging a structured dataset covering a 9 x 11 grid. The study spans from January 2011 to October 2024, and we evaluate the impact of integrating three surface station systems. Among the tested configurations, the fusion-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.2033 for forecasting heavy precipitation events (greater than 25 mm/h) at a one-hour lead time. Additionally, we present an ablation study to assess the contribution of each station network and propose a refined inference strategy for precipitation nowcasting, integrating the GFS numerical weather prediction (NWP) data with in-situ observations.

Title: Eta-WavLM: Efficient Speaker Identity Removal in Self-Supervised Speech Representations Using a Simple Linear Equation
Authors: Giuseppe Ruggiero, Matteo Testa, Jurgen Van de Walle, Luigi Di Caro
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has reduced the reliance on expensive labeling in speech technologies by learning meaningful representations from unannotated data. Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However, removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Towards Reliable Large Audio Language Model
Authors: Ziyang Ma, Xiquan Li, Yakun Song, Wenxi Chen, Chenpeng Du, Jian Wu, Yuanzhe Chen, Zhuo Chen, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Xie Chen
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and speech.

Title: Passive Vibration Control of a 3-D Printer Gantry
Authors: Maharshi A. Sharma, Albert E. Patterson
Abstract: Improved additive manufacturing capabilities are vital for the future development and improvement of ubiquitous robotic systems. These machines can be integrated into existing robotic systems to allow manufacturing and repair of components, as well as fabrication of custom parts for the robots themselves. The fused filament fabrication (FFF) process is one of the most common and well-developed AM processes but suffers from the effects of vibration-induced position error, particularly as the printing speed is raised. This project adapted and expanded a dynamic model of an FFF gantry system to include a passive spring-mass-damper system controller attached to the extruder carriage and tuned using optimal parameters. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the effects and generate recommendations for implementation. This work is also valuable for other mechatronic systems which operate using an open-loop control system and which suffer from vibration, including numerous robotic systems, pick-and-place machines, positioners, and similar.

Title: GSA-TTS : Toward Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis based on Gradual Style Adaptor
Authors: Seokgi Lee, Jungjun Kim
Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its hierarchical structure.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM) policy for a constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities. Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space. We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.

Title: Split-as-a-Pro: behavioral control via operator splitting and alternating projections
Authors: Yu Tang, Carlo Cenedese, Alessio Rimoldi, Florian Dórfler, John Lygeros, Alberto Padoan
Abstract: The paper introduces Split-as-a-Pro, a control framework that integrates behavioral systems theory, operator splitting methods, and alternating projection algorithms. The framework reduces dynamic optimization problems - arising in both control and estimation - to efficient projection computations. Split-as-a-Pro builds on a non-parametric formulation that exploits system structure to separate dynamic constraints imposed by individual subsystems from external ones, such as interconnection constraints and input/output constraints. This enables the use of arbitrary system representations, as long as the associated projection is efficiently computable, thereby enhancing scalability and compatibility with gray-box modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Split-as-a-Pro by developing a distributed algorithm for solving finite-horizon linear quadratic control problems and illustrate its use in predictive control. Our numerical case studies show that algorithms obtained using Split-as-a-Pro significantly outperform their centralized counterparts in runtime and scalability across various standard graph topologies, while seamlessly leveraging both model-based and data-driven system representations.

Title: RA-CLAP: Relation-Augmented Emotional Speaking Style Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining For Speech Retrieval
Authors: Haoqin Sun, Jingguang Tian, Jiaming Zhou, Hui Wang, Jiabei He, Shiwan Zhao, Xiangyu Kong, Desheng Hu, Xinkang Xu, Xinhui Hu, Yong Qin
Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model has demonstrated excellent performance in general audio description-related tasks, such as audio retrieval. However, in the emerging field of emotional speaking style description (ESSD), cross-modal contrastive pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel speech retrieval task called emotional speaking style retrieval (ESSR), and ESS-CLAP, an emotional speaking style CLAP model tailored for learning relationship between speech and natural language descriptions. In addition, we further propose relation-augmented CLAP (RA-CLAP) to address the limitation of traditional methods that assume a strict binary relationship between caption and audio. The model leverages self-distillation to learn the potential local matching relationships between speech and descriptions, thereby enhancing generalization ability. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of RA-CLAP, providing valuable reference in ESSD.

Title: Direct Pseudospectral Optimal Control by Orthogonal Polynomial Integral Collocation
Authors: Thomas L. Ahrens, Ian M. Down, Manoranjan Majji
Abstract: This paper details a methodology to transcribe an optimal control problem into a nonlinear program for generation of the trajectories that optimize a given functional by approximating only the highest order derivatives of a given system's dynamics. The underlying method uses orthogonal polynomial integral collocation by which successive integrals are taken to approximate all lower order states. Hence, one set of polynomial coefficients can represent an entire coordinate's degree of freedom. Specifically, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind and Legendre polynomials are used over their associated common interpolating grids derived from the bases' roots and extrema. Simple example problems compare different polynomial bases' performance to analytical solutions. The planar circular orbit raising problem is used to verify the method with solutions obtained by other pseudospectral methods in literature. Finally, a rocket landing flip maneuver problem is solved to demonstrate the ability to solve complex problems with multiple states and control variables with constraints. Simulations establish this method's performance, and reveal that the polynomial/node choice for a given problem notably affects the performance.

Title: Room Impulse Response as a Prompt for Acoustic Echo Cancellation
Authors: Fei Zhao, Shulin He, Xueliang Zhang
Abstract: Data-driven acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) methods, predominantly trained on synthetic or constrained real-world datasets, encounter performance declines in unseen echo scenarios, especially in real environments where echo paths are not directly observable. Our proposed method counters this limitation by integrating room impulse response (RIR) as a pivotal training prompt, aiming to improve the generalization of AEC models in such unforeseen conditions. We also explore four RIR prompt fusion methods. Comprehensive evaluations, including both simulated RIR under unknown conditions and recorded RIR in real, demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves performance compared to baseline models. These results substantiate the effectiveness of our RIR-guided approach in strengthening the model's generalization capabilities.

Title: Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation Based on Direction-of-Arrival Estimation
Authors: Fei Zhao, Xueliang Zhang, Zhong-Qiu Wang
Abstract: Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is an important speech signal processing technology that can remove echoes from microphone signals to enable natural-sounding full-duplex speech communication. While single-channel AEC is widely adopted, multi-channel AEC can leverage spatial cues afforded by multiple microphones to achieve better performance. Existing multi-channel AEC approaches typically combine beamforming with deep neural networks (DNN). This work proposes a two-stage algorithm that enhances multi-channel AEC by incorporating sound source directional cues. Specifically, a lightweight DNN is first trained to predict the sound source directions, and then the predicted directional information, multi-channel microphone signals, and single-channel far-end signal are jointly fed into an AEC network to estimate the near-end signal. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline approaches and exhibits robust generalization across diverse acoustic environments.

Title: LLA-MPC: Fast Adaptive Control for Autonomous Racing
Authors: Maitham F. AL-Sunni, Hassan Almubarak, Katherine Horng, John M. Dolan
Abstract: We present Look-Back and Look-Ahead Adaptive Model Predictive Control (LLA-MPC), a real-time adaptive control framework for autonomous racing that addresses the challenge of rapidly changing tire-surface interactions. Unlike existing approaches requiring substantial data collection or offline training, LLA-MPC employs a model bank for immediate adaptation without a learning period. It integrates two key mechanisms: a look-back window that evaluates recent vehicle behavior to select the most accurate model and a look-ahead horizon that optimizes trajectory planning based on the identified dynamics. The selected model and estimated friction coefficient are then incorporated into a trajectory planner to optimize reference paths in real-time. Experiments across diverse racing scenarios demonstrate that LLA-MPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adaptation speed and handling, even during sudden friction transitions. Its learning-free, computationally efficient design enables rapid adaptation, making it ideal for high-speed autonomous racing in multi-surface environments.

Title: Learning Dynamics under Environmental Constraints via Measurement-Induced Bundle Structures
Authors: Dongzhe Zheng, Wenjie Mei
Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain sensing conditions.

Title: Training-Free Multi-Step Audio Source Separation
Authors: Yongyi Zang, Jingyi Li, Qiuqiang Kong
Abstract: Audio source separation aims to separate a mixture into target sources. Previous audio source separation systems usually conduct one-step inference, which does not fully explore the separation ability of models. In this work, we reveal that pretrained one-step audio source separation models can be leveraged for multi-step separation without additional training. We propose a simple yet effective inference method that iteratively applies separation by optimally blending the input mixture with the previous step's separation result. At each step, we determine the optimal blending ratio by maximizing a metric. We prove that our method always yield improvement over one-step inference, provide error bounds based on model smoothness and metric robustness, and provide theoretical analysis connecting our method to denoising along linear interpolation paths between noise and clean distributions, a property we link to denoising diffusion bridge models. Our approach effectively delivers improved separation performance as a "free lunch" from existing models. Our empirical results demonstrate that our multi-step separation approach consistently outperforms one-step inference across both speech enhancement and music source separation tasks, and can achieve scaling performance similar to training a larger model, using more data, or in some cases employing a multi-step training objective. These improvements appear not only on the optimization metric during multi-step inference, but also extend to nearly all non-optimized metrics (with one exception). We also discuss limitations of our approach and directions for future research.

Title: Decoding Speaker-Normalized Pitch from EEG for Mandarin Perception
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, Yiming Wang, Ziyu Zhang, Jiayang Han, Yin-Long Liu, Rui Feng, Xiuyuan Liang, Zhen-Hua Ling, Jiahong Yuan
Abstract: The same speech content produced by different speakers exhibits significant differences in pitch contour, yet listeners' semantic perception remains unaffected. This phenomenon may stem from the brain's perception of pitch contours being independent of individual speakers' pitch ranges. In this work, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to Mandarin monosyllables with varying tones, phonemes, and speakers. The CE-ViViT model is proposed to decode raw or speaker-normalized pitch contours directly from EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can decode pitch contours with modest errors, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEG regression methods. Moreover, speaker-normalized pitch contours were decoded more accurately, supporting the neural encoding of relative pitch.

Title: STOPA: A Database of Systematic VariaTion Of DeePfake Audio for Open-Set Source Tracing and Attribution
Authors: Anton Firc, Manasi Chibber, Jagabandhu Mishra, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Tomi Kinnunen, Kamil Malinka
Abstract: A key research area in deepfake speech detection is source tracing - determining the origin of synthesised utterances. The approaches may involve identifying the acoustic model (AM), vocoder model (VM), or other generation-specific parameters. However, progress is limited by the lack of a dedicated, systematically curated dataset. To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability. This control improves attribution accuracy, aiding forensic analysis, deepfake detection, and generative model transparency.

Title: SACM: SEEG-Audio Contrastive Matching for Chinese Speech Decoding
Authors: Hongbin Wang, Zhihong Jia, Yuanzhong Shen, Ziwei Wang, Siyang Li, Kai Shu, Feng Hu, Dongrui Wu
Abstract: Speech disorders such as dysarthria and anarthria can severely impair the patient's ability to communicate verbally. Speech decoding brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a potential alternative by directly translating speech intentions into spoken words, serving as speech neuroprostheses. This paper reports an experimental protocol for Mandarin Chinese speech decoding BCIs, along with the corresponding decoding algorithms. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and synchronized audio data were collected from eight drug-resistant epilepsy patients as they conducted a word-level reading task. The proposed SEEG and Audio Contrastive Matching (SACM), a contrastive learning-based framework, achieved decoding accuracies significantly exceeding chance levels in both speech detection and speech decoding tasks. Electrode-wise analysis revealed that a single sensorimotor cortex electrode achieved performance comparable to that of the full electrode array. These findings provide valuable insights for developing more accurate online speech decoding BCIs.

Title: A Comprehensive Real-World Assessment of Audio Watermarking Algorithms: Will They Survive Neural Codecs?
Authors: Yigitcan Özer, Woosung Choi, Joan Serrà, Mayank Kumar Singh, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: We present a framework to foster the evaluation of deep learning-based audio watermarking algorithms, establishing a standardized benchmark and allowing systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline, featuring various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is accessible at this http URL.

Title: Reshaping Representation Space to Balance the Safety and Over-rejection in Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Hao Yang, Lizhen Qu, Ehsan Shareghi, Gholamreza Haffari
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However, recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains harmful examples.

Title: Automated evaluation of children's speech fluency for low-resource languages
Authors: Bowen Zhang, Nur Afiqah Abdul Latiff, Justin Kan, Rong Tong, Donny Soh, Xiaoxiao Miao, Ian McLoughlin
Abstract: Assessment of children's speaking fluency in education is well researched for majority languages, but remains highly challenging for low resource languages. This paper proposes a system to automatically assess fluency by combining a fine-tuned multilingual ASR model, an objective metrics extraction stage, and a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. The objective metrics include phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio. These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than multimodal GPT or other methods.

Title: DiEmo-TTS: Disentangled Emotion Representations via Self-Supervised Distillation for Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer in Text-to-Speech
Authors: Deok-Hyeon Cho, Hyung-Seok Oh, Seung-Bin Kim, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.

Title: EmoSphere-SER: Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Spherical Representation with Auxiliary Classification
Authors: Deok-Hyeon Cho, Hyung-Seok Oh, Seung-Bin Kim, Seong-Whan Lee
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal, valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.

Title: Modeling Beyond MOS: Quality Assessment Models Must Integrate Context, Reasoning, and Multimodality
Authors: Mohamed Amine Kerkouri, Marouane Tliba, Aladine Chetouani, Nour Aburaed, Alessandro Bruno
Abstract: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness, to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2) reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned, and trustworthy evaluation systems.

Title: Capacity-Optimized Pre-Equalizer Design for Visible Light Communication Systems
Authors: Runxin Zhang, Yulin Shao, Jian Xiong, Lu Lu, Murat Uysal
Abstract: Since commercial LEDs are primarily designed for illumination rather than data transmission, their modulation bandwidth is inherently limited to a few MHz. This becomes a major bottleneck in the implementation of visible light communication (VLC) systems necessiating the design of pre-equalizers. While state-of-the-art equalizer designs primarily focus on the data rate increasing through bandwidth expansion, they often overlook the accompanying degradation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Achieving effective bandwidth extension without introducing excessive SNR penalties remains a significant challenge, since the channel capacity is a non-linear function of both parameters. In this paper, we present a fundamental analysis of how the parameters of the LED and pre-equalization circuits influence the channel capacity in intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD)-based VLC systems. We derive a closed-form expression for channel capacity model that is an explicitly function of analog pre-equalizer circuit parameters. Building upon the derived capacity expression, we propose a systematic design methodology for analog pre-equalizers that effectively balances bandwidth and SNR, thereby maximizing the overall channel capacity across a wide range of channel attenuations. We present extensive numerical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrate the improvements over conventional bandwidth-optimized pre-equalizer designs.

Title: The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation
Authors: Sajjad Shahabodini, Mobina Mansoori, Farnoush Bayatmakou, Jamshid Abouei, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Arash Mohammadi
Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

Title: ALAS: Measuring Latent Speech-Text Alignment For Spoken Language Understanding In Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Pooneh Mousavi, Yingzhi Wang, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study examines the correlation between audio and text representations across transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across different layers and different tasks.

Title: Task-Oriented Low-Label Semantic Communication With Self-Supervised Learning
Authors: Run Gu, Wei Xu, Zhaohui Yang, Dusit Niyato, Aylin Yener
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by conveying semantic information rather than exact messages. Deep learning (DL)-based semantic communication can effectively cultivate the essential semantic knowledge for semantic extraction, transmission, and interpretation by leveraging massive labeled samples for downstream task training. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework (SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with limited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant semantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in real-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we introduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the information bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the informativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given the computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and effective solution by employing self-supervised classification and reconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training methods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even with few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image classification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital coding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set sizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the downstream tasks.

Title: Signed Angle Rigid Graphs for Network Localization and Formation Control
Authors: Jinpeng Huang, Gangshan Jing
Abstract: Graph rigidity theory studies the capability of a graph embedded in the Euclidean space to constrain its global geometric shape via local constraints among nodes and edges, and has been widely exploited in network localization and formation control. In recent years, the traditional rigidity theory has been extended by considering new types of local constraints such as bearing, angle, ratio of distance, etc. Among them, the signed angle constraint received extensive attention since it is practically measurable and independent of the global coordinate frame. However, existing studies on signed angle rigidity always consider special graph structures, which are actually not necessary. This paper presents a comprehensive combinatorial analysis in terms of graphs and angle index sets for signed angle rigidity. We show that Laman graphs equivalently characterize minimally signed angle rigid graphs. Moreover, we propose a method to construct the minimal set of signed angle constraints in a Laman graph to effectively ensure signed angle rigidity. These results are finally applied to distributed network localization and formation stabilization problems, respectively, where each agent only has access to signed angle measurements.

Title: Dynamically Learned Test-Time Model Routing in Language Model Zoos with Service Level Guarantees
Authors: Herbert Woisetschläger, Ryan Zhang, Shiqiang Wang, Hans-Arno Jacobsen
Abstract: Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

Title: Novel Loss-Enhanced Universal Adversarial Patches for Sustainable Speaker Privacy
Authors: Elvir Karimov, Alexander Varlamov, Danil Ivanov, Dmitrii Korzh, Oleg Y. Rogov
Abstract: Deep learning voice models are commonly used nowadays, but the safety processing of personal data, such as human identity and speech content, remains suspicious. To prevent malicious user identification, speaker anonymization methods were proposed. Current methods, particularly based on universal adversarial patch (UAP) applications, have drawbacks such as significant degradation of audio quality, decreased speech recognition quality, low transferability across different voice biometrics models, and performance dependence on the input audio length. To mitigate these drawbacks, in this work, we introduce and leverage the novel Exponential Total Variance (TV) loss function and provide experimental evidence that it positively affects UAP strength and imperceptibility. Moreover, we present a novel scalable UAP insertion procedure and demonstrate its uniformly high performance for various audio lengths.

Title: DeepDialogue: A Multi-Turn Emotionally-Rich Spoken Dialogue Dataset
Authors: Alkis Koudounas, Moreno La Quatra, Elena Baralis
Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth, and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate 65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6 dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves emotional context across multi-turn conversations.

Title: A Cooperative Aerial System of A Payload Drone Equipped with Dexterous Rappelling End Droid for Cluttered Space Pickup
Authors: Wenjing Ren, Xin Dong, Yangjie Cui, Binqi Yang, Haoze Li, Tao Yu, Jinwu Xiang, Daochun Li, Zhan Tu
Abstract: In cluttered spaces, such as forests, drone picking up a payload via an abseil claw is an open challenge, as the cable is likely tangled and blocked by the branches and obstacles. To address such a challenge, in this work, a cooperative aerial system is proposed, which consists of a payload drone and a dexterous rappelling end droid. The two ends are linked via a Kevlar tether cable. The end droid is actuated by four propellers, which enable mid-air dexterous adjustment of clawing angle and guidance of cable movement. To avoid tanglement and rappelling obstacles, a trajectory optimization method that integrates cable length constraints and dynamic feasibility is developed, which guarantees safe pickup. A tether cable dynamic model is established to evaluate real-time cable status, considering both taut and sagging conditions. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of picking up payload in cluttered spaces. As a result, the end droid can reach the target point successfully under cable constraints and achieve passive retrieval during the lifting phase without propulsion, which enables effective and efficient aerial manipulation.

Title: Multi-modal brain encoding models for multi-modal stimuli
Authors: Subba Reddy Oota, Khushbu Pahwa, Mounika Marreddy, Maneesh Singh, Manish Gupta, Bapi S. Raju
Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

Title: Towards Video to Piano Music Generation with Chain-of-Perform Support Benchmarks
Authors: Chang Liu, Haomin Zhang, Shiyu Xia, Zihao Chen, Chaofan Ding, Xin Yue, Huizhe Chen, Xinhan Di
Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate semantic and temporal this http URL, existing evaluation datasets do not fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1) existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at this https URL, with a continuously updated leaderboard to promote ongoing research in this domain.

Title: Synthetic Time Series Forecasting with Transformer Architectures: Extensive Simulation Benchmarks
Authors: Ali Forootani, Mohammad Khosravi
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing levels of complexity and modeling capacity. We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across model families. To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and complex real-world conditions.

Title: Automated data curation for self-supervised learning in underwater acoustic analysis
Authors: Hilde I Hummel, Sandjai Bhulai, Burooj Ghani, Rob van der Mei
Abstract: The sustainability of the ocean ecosystem is threatened by increased levels of sound pollution, making monitoring crucial to understand its variability and impact. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of underwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis impossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers a potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled. Self-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from large-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural Language Processing, and audio. However, these models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets for training in order to generalize well. To address this, a fully automated self-supervised data curation pipeline is proposed to create a diverse and balanced dataset from raw PAM data. It integrates Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with recordings from various hydrophones in the U.S. waters. Using hierarchical k-means clustering, the raw audio data is sampled and then combined with AIS samples to create a balanced and diverse dataset. The resulting curated dataset enables the development of self-supervised learning models, facilitating various tasks such as monitoring marine mammals and assessing sound pollution.

Title: Exploring Generative Error Correction for Dysarthric Speech Recognition
Authors: Moreno La Quatra, Alkis Koudounas, Valerio Mario Salerno, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines, accurately transcribing dysarthric speech remains a major challenge. In this work, we proposed a two-stage framework for the Speech Accessibility Project Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2025, which combines cutting-edge speech recognition models with LLM-based generative error correction (GER). We assess different configurations of model scales and training strategies, incorporating specific hypothesis selection to improve transcription accuracy. Experiments on the Speech Accessibility Project dataset demonstrate the strength of our approach on structured and spontaneous speech, while highlighting challenges in single-word recognition. Through comprehensive analysis, we provide insights into the complementary roles of acoustic and linguistic modeling in dysarthric speech recognition

Title: "KAN you hear me?" Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Spoken Language Understanding
Authors: Alkis Koudounas, Moreno La Quatra, Eliana Pastor, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Elena Baralis
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional neural architectures, yet their application to speech processing remains under explored. This work presents the first investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup, which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.

Title: Efficient Speech Translation through Model Compression and Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Yasmin Moslem
Abstract: Efficient deployment of large audio-language models for speech translation remains challenging due to their significant computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge through our system submissions to the "Model Compression" track at the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025). We experiment with a combination of approaches including iterative layer pruning based on layer importance evaluation, low-rank adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), and knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.

Title: Towards End-to-End Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin
Authors: Amina Mardiyyah Rufai, Afolabi Abeeb, Esther Oduntan, Tayo Arulogun, Oluwabukola Adegboro, Daniel Ajisafe
Abstract: The prevalence of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in spoken language applications has increased significantly in recent years. Notably, many African languages lack sufficient linguistic resources to support the robustness of these systems. This paper focuses on the development of an end-to-end speech recognition system customized for Nigerian Pidgin English. We investigated and evaluated different pretrained state-of-the-art architectures on a new dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate a notable performance of the variant Wav2Vec2 XLSR-53 on our dataset, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 29.6% on the test set, surpassing other architectures such as NEMO QUARTZNET and Wav2Vec2.0 BASE-100H in quantitative assessments. Additionally, we demonstrate that pretrained state-of-the-art architectures do not work well out-of-the-box. We performed zero-shot evaluation using XLSR-English as the baseline, chosen for its similarity to Nigerian Pidgin. This yielded a higher WER of 73.7%. By adapting this architecture to nuances represented in our dataset, we reduce error by 59.84%. Our dataset comprises 4,288 recorded utterances from 10 native speakers, partitioned into training, validation, and test sets. This study underscores the potential for improving ASR systems for under-resourced languages like Nigerian Pidgin English, contributing to greater inclusion in speech technology applications. We publicly release our unique parallel dataset (speech-to-text) on Nigerian Pidgin, as well as the model weights on Hugging Face. Our code would be made available to foster future research from the community.

Title: You Can Wash Hands Better: Accurate Daily Handwashing Assessment with a Smartwatch
Authors: Fei Wang, Tingting Zhang, Xilei Wu, Pengcheng Wang, Xin Wang, Han Ding, Jingang Shi, Jinsong Han, Dong Huang
Abstract: Hand hygiene is among the most effective daily practices for preventing infectious diseases such as influenza, malaria, and skin infections. While professional guidelines emphasize proper handwashing to reduce the risk of viral infections, surveys reveal that adherence to these recommendations remains low. To address this gap, we propose UWash, a wearable solution leveraging smartwatches to evaluate handwashing procedures, aiming to raise awareness and cultivate high-quality handwashing habits. We frame the task of handwashing assessment as an action segmentation problem, similar to those in computer vision, and introduce a simple yet efficient two-stream UNet-like network to achieve this goal. Experiments involving 51 subjects demonstrate that UWash achieves 92.27% accuracy in handwashing gesture recognition, an error of <0.5 seconds in onset/offset detection, and an error of <5 points in gesture scoring under user-dependent settings. The system also performs robustly in user-independent and user-independent-location-independent evaluations. Remarkably, UWash maintains high performance in real-world tests, including evaluations with 10 random passersby at a hospital 9 months later and 10 passersby in an in-the-wild test conducted 2 years later. UWash is the first system to score handwashing quality based on gesture sequences, offering actionable guidance for improving daily hand hygiene.

Title: Boosting Convolution with Efficient MLP-Permutation for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yi Lin, Xiao Fang, Dong Zhang, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Hao Chen
Abstract: Recently, the advent of vision Transformer (ViT) has brought substantial advancements in 3D dataset benchmarks, particularly in 3D volumetric medical image segmentation (Vol-MedSeg). Concurrently, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network has regained popularity among researchers due to their comparable results to ViT, albeit with the exclusion of the resource-intensive self-attention module. In this work, we propose a novel permutable hybrid network for Vol-MedSeg, named PHNet, which capitalizes on the strengths of both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and MLP. PHNet addresses the intrinsic isotropy problem of 3D volumetric data by employing a combination of 2D and 3D CNNs to extract local features. Besides, we propose an efficient multi-layer permute perceptron (MLPP) module that captures long-range dependence while preserving positional information. This is achieved through an axis decomposition operation that permutes the input tensor along different axes, thereby enabling the separate encoding of the positional information. Furthermore, MLPP tackles the resolution sensitivity issue of MLP in Vol-MedSeg with a token segmentation operation, which divides the feature into smaller tokens and processes them individually. Extensive experimental results validate that PHNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with lower computational costs on the widely-used yet challenging COVID-19-20 and Synapse benchmarks. The ablation study also demonstrates the effectiveness of PHNet in harnessing the strengths of both CNNs and MLP. The code is available on Github: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

Title: Convex NMPC reformulations for a special class of nonlinear multi-input systems with application to rank-one bilinear networks
Authors: Manuel Klädtke, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: We show that a special class of (nonconvex) NMPC problems admits an exact solution by reformulating them as a finite number of convex subproblems, extending previous results to the multi-input case. Our approach is applicable to a special class of input-affine discrete-time systems, which includes a class of bilinear rank-one systems that is considered useful in modeling certain controlled networks. We illustrate our results with two numerical examples, including the aforementioned rank-one bilinear network.

Title: Implicit predictors in regularized data-driven predictive control
Authors: Manuel Klädtke, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: We introduce the notion of implicit predictors, which characterize the input-(state)-output prediction behavior underlying a predictive control scheme, even if it is not explicitly enforced as an equality constraint (as in traditional model or subspace predictive control). To demonstrate this concept, we derive and analyze implicit predictors for some basic data-driven predictive control (DPC) schemes, which offers a new perspective on this popular approach that may form the basis for modified DPC schemes and further theoretical insights.

Title: GRN-Transformer: Enhancing Motion Artifact Detection in PICU Photoplethysmogram Signals
Authors: Thanh-Dung Le, Clara Macabiau, Kévin Albert, Philippe Jouvet, Rita Noumeir
Abstract: This study investigates artifact detection in clinical photoplethysmogram signals using Transformer-based models. Recent findings have shown that in detecting artifacts from the Pediatric Critical Care Unit at CHU Sainte-Justine (CHUSJ), semi-supervised learning label propagation and conventional supervised machine learning (K-nearest neighbors) outperform the Transformer-based attention mechanism, particularly in limited data scenarios. However, these methods exhibit sensitivity to data volume and limited improvement with increased data availability. We propose the GRN-Transformer, an innovative model that integrates the Gated Residual Network (GRN) into the Transformer architecture to overcome these limitations. The GRN-Transformer demonstrates superior performance, achieving remarkable metrics of 98% accuracy, 90% precision, 97% recall, and 93% F1 score, clearly surpassing the Transformer's results of 95% accuracy, 85% precision, 86% recall, and 85% F1 score. By integrating the GRN, which excels at feature extraction, with the Transformer's attention mechanism, the proposed GRN-Transformer overcomes the limitations of previous methods. It achieves smoother training and validation loss, effectively mitigating overfitting and demonstrating enhanced performance in small datasets with imbalanced classes. The GRN-Transformer's potential impact on artifact detection can significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of the clinical decision support system at CHUSJ, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and safety. Remarkably, the proposed model stands as the pioneer in its domain, being the first of its kind to detect artifacts from PPG signals. Further research could explore its applicability to other medical domains and datasets with similar constraints.

Title: A Unifying Perspective for Safety of Stochastic Systems: From Barrier Functions to Finite Abstractions
Authors: Luca Laurenti, Morteza Lahijanian
Abstract: Providing safety guarantees for stochastic dynamical systems is a central problem in various fields, including control theory, machine learning, and robotics. Existing methods either employ Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) or rely on numerical approaches based on finite abstractions. SBFs, analogous to Lyapunov functions, are used to establish (probabilistic) set invariance, whereas abstraction-based approaches approximate the stochastic system with a finite model to compute safety probability bounds. This paper presents a unifying perspective on these seemingly different approaches. Specifically, we show that both methods can be interpreted as approximations of a stochastic dynamic programming problem. This perspective allows us to formally establish the correctness of both techniques, characterize their convergence and optimality properties, and analyze their respective assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Our analysis reveals that, unlike SBFs-based methods, abstraction-based approaches can provide asymptotically optimal safety certificates, albeit at the cost of increased computational effort.

Title: Brain Tumor Diagnosis Using Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Muhammad Al-Zafar Khan, Abdullah Al Omar Galib, Nouhaila Innan, Mohamed Bennai
Abstract: Accurate classification of brain tumors from MRI scans is critical for effective treatment planning. This study presents a Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (HQCNN) that integrates quantum feature-encoding circuits with depth-wise separable convolutional layers to analyze images from a publicly available brain tumor dataset. Evaluated on this dataset, the HQCNN achieved 99.16% training accuracy and 91.47% validation accuracy, demonstrating robust performance across varied imaging conditions. The quantum layers capture complex, non-linear relationships, while separable convolutions ensure computational efficiency. By reducing both parameter count and circuit depth, the architecture is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish a foundation for integrating quantum-enhanced models into medical-imaging workflows with minimal changes to existing software platforms. Future work will extend evaluation to multi-center cohorts, assess real-time inference on quantum simulators and hardware, and explore integration with surgical-planning systems.

Title: Data-Based Control of Continuous-Time Linear Systems with Performance Specifications
Authors: Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: The design of direct data-based controllers has become a fundamental part of control theory research in the last few years. In this paper, we consider three classes of data-based state feedback control problems for linear systems. These control problems are such that, besides stabilization, some additional performance requirements must be satisfied. First, we formulate and solve a trajectory-reference control problem, on which desired closed-loop trajectories are known and a controller that allows the system to closely follow those trajectories is computed. Then, the solution of the LQR problem for continuous-time systems is presented. Finally, we consider the case in which the precise position of the desired poles of the closed-loop system is known, and introduce a data-based variant of a robust pole-placement procedure. The applicability of the proposed methods is tested using numerical simulations.

Title: Diff-Def: Diffusion-Generated Deformation Fields for Conditional Atlases
Authors: Sophie Starck, Vasiliki Sideri-Lampretsa, Bernhard Kainz, Martin J. Menten, Tamara T. Mueller, Daniel Rueckert
Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population studies and analysis. Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases.

Title: Transformer Meets Gated Residual Networks To Enhance Photoplethysmogram Artifact Detection Informed by Mutual Information Neural Estimation
Authors: Thanh-Dung Le, Clara Macabiau, Kévin Albert, Symeon Chatzinotas, Philippe Jouvet, Rita Noumeir
Abstract: This study delves into the effectiveness of various learning methods in improving Transformer models, focusing particularly on the Gated Residual Network Transformer (GRN-Transformer) in the context of pediatric intensive care units (PICU) with limited data availability. Our findings indicate that Transformers trained via supervised learning are less effective compared to MLP, CNN, and LSTM networks in such environments. Yet, leveraging unsupervised and self-supervised learning on unannotated data, with subsequent fine-tuning on annotated data, notably enhances Transformer performance, although not to the level of the GRN-Transformer. Central to our research is the analysis of different activation functions for the Gated Linear Unit (GLU), a crucial element of the GRN structure. We also employ Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to evaluate the GRN's contribution. Additionally, the study examines the effects of integrating GRN within the Transformer's Attention mechanism versus using it as a separate intermediary layer. Our results highlight that GLU with sigmoid activation stands out, achieving 0.98 accuracy, 0.91 precision, 0.96 recall, and 0.94 F1 score. The MINE analysis supports the hypothesis that GRN enhances the mutual information between the hidden representations and the output. Moreover, the use of GRN as an intermediate filter layer proves more beneficial than incorporating it within the Attention mechanism. In summary, this research clarifies how GRN bolsters GRN-Transformer's performance, surpassing other learning techniques. These findings offer a promising avenue for adopting sophisticated models like Transformers in data-constrained environments, such as PPG artifact detection in PICU settings.

Title: Computationally Efficient System Level Tube-MPC for Uncertain Systems
Authors: Jerome Sieber, Alexandre Didier, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Tube-based model predictive control (MPC) is one of the principal robust control techniques for constrained linear systems affected by additive disturbances. While tube-based methods with online-computed tubes have been successfully applied to systems with additive disturbances, their application to systems affected by additional model uncertainties is challenging. This paper proposes a tube-based MPC method - named filter-based system level tube-MPC (SLTMPC) - which overapproximates both types of uncertainties with an online optimized disturbance set, while simultaneously computing the tube controller online. For the first time, we provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees for receding horizon control of such a MPC method. These guarantees are obtained by virtue of a new terminal controller design and an online optimized terminal set. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method, we additionally introduce an asynchronous computation scheme that separates the optimization of the tube controller and the nominal trajectory. Finally, we provide a comprehensive numerical evaluation of the proposed methods to demonstrate their effectiveness.

Title: ALMA: a mathematics-driven approach for determining tuning parameters in generalized LASSO problems, with applications to MRI
Authors: Gianluca Giacchi, Isidoros Iakovidis, Bastien Milani, Micah Murray, Benedetta Franceschiello
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique employed for non-invasive in vivo visualization of internal structures. Sparsity is often deployed to accelerate the signal acquisition or overcome the presence of motion artifacts, improving the quality of image reconstruction. Image reconstruction algorithms use TV-regularized LASSO (Total Variation-regularized LASSO) to retrieve the missing information of undersampled signals, by cleaning the data of noise and while optimizing sparsity. A tuning parameter moderates the balance between these two aspects; its choice affecting the quality of the reconstructions. Currently, there is a lack of general deterministic techniques to choose these parameters, which are oftentimes manually selected and thus hinder the reliability of the reconstructions. Here, we present ALMA (Algorithm for Lagrange Multipliers Approximation), an iterative mathematics-inspired technique that computes tuning parameters for generalized LASSO problems during MRI reconstruction. We analyze quantitatively the performance of these parameters for imaging reconstructions via TV-LASSO in an MRI context on phantoms. Although our study concentrates on TV-LASSO, the techniques developed here hold significant promise for a wide array of applications. ALMA is not only adaptable to more generalized LASSO problems but is also robust to accommodate other forms of regularization beyond total variation. Moreover, it extends effectively to handle non-Cartesian sampling trajectories, broadening its utility in complex data reconstruction scenarios. More generally, ALMA provides a powerful tool for numerically solving constrained optimization problems across various disciplines, offering a versatile and impactful solution for advanced computational challenges.

Title: Data-Driven Subsynchronous Oscillation Suppression for Renewable Energy Integrated Power Systems Based on Koopman Operator
Authors: Zihan Wang, Ziyang Huang, Xiaonan Zhang, Gengyin Li, Le Zheng
Abstract: Recently, subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) have emerged frequently worldwide, with the high penetration of renewable power generation in modern power systems. The SSO introduced by renewables has become a prominent new stability problem, seriously threatening the stable operation of systems. This paper proposes a data-driven dynamic optimal controller for renewable energy integrated power systems, to suppress SSOs with the control of renewables. The challenges of the controller design are the nonlinearity, complexity and hard accessibility of the system models. Using Koopman operator, the system dynamics are accurately extracted from data and utilized to the linear model predictive control (MPC). Firstly, the globally linear representation of the system dynamics is obtained by lifting, and the key states are selected as control signals by analyzing Koopman participation factors. Subsequently, augmented with the control term, the Koopman linear parameter-varying predictor of the controlled system is constructed. Finally, using MPC, the proposed controller computes control signals online in a moving horizon fashion. Case studies show that the proposed controller is effective, adaptive and robust in various conditions, surpassing other controllers with reliable control performance.

Title: We Need Variations in Speech Generation: Sub-center Modelling for Speaker Embeddings
Authors: Ismail Rasim Ulgen, Carlos Busso, John H. L. Hansen, Berrak Sisman
Abstract: Modeling the rich prosodic variations inherent in human speech is essential for generating natural-sounding speech. While speaker embeddings are commonly used as conditioning inputs in personalized speech generation, they are typically optimized for speaker recognition, which encourages the loss of intra-speaker variation. This strategy makes them suboptimal for speech generation in terms of modeling the rich variations at the output speech distribution. In this work, we propose a novel speaker embedding network that employs multiple sub-centers per speaker class during training, instead of a single center as in conventional approaches. This sub-center modeling allows the embedding to capture a broader range of speaker-specific variations while maintaining speaker classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed embeddings on a voice conversion task, showing improved naturalness and prosodic expressiveness in the synthesized speech.

Title: Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements
Authors: Anubhab Ghosh, Yonina C. Eldar, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.

Title: Convergence Analysis of Gradient Flow for Overparameterized LQR Formulations
Authors: Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Milad Siami, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper analyses the intersection between results from gradient methods for the model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear feedforward neural networks (LFFNNs), More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a LFFNN feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by analyzing the structure of the gradient expression for the parameters of each layer, which implies a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to generalize existing results on boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer, for which the paper proves that the training converges not only to the critical points, but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of Lebesgue measure zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem -- the ``vector case'' -- proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and small-input input-to-state stability (ISS) for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to non-overparameterized formulations, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed, but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.

Title: Personalized Voice Synthesis through Human-in-the-Loop Coordinate Descent
Authors: Yusheng Tian, Junbin Liu, Tan Lee
Abstract: This paper describes a human-in-the-loop approach to personalized voice synthesis in the absence of reference speech data from the target speaker. It is intended to help vocally disabled individuals restore their lost voices without requiring any prior recordings. The proposed approach leverages a learned speaker embedding space. Starting from an initial voice, users iteratively refine the speaker embedding parameters through a coordinate descent-like process, guided by auditory perception. By analyzing the latent space, it is noted that that the embedding parameters correspond to perceptual voice attributes, including pitch, vocal tension, brightness, and nasality, making the search process intuitive. Computer simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in approximating target voices across a diverse range of test cases.

Title: A Homogeneous Graph Neural Network for Precoding and Power Allocation in Scalable Wireless Networks
Authors: Mingjun Sun, Shaochuan Wu, Haojie Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Guoyu Li, Tong Zhang
Abstract: Deep learning is widely used in wireless communications but struggles with fixed neural network sizes, which limit their adaptability in environments where the number of users and antennas varies. To overcome this, this paper introduced a generalization strategy for precoding and power allocation in scalable wireless networks. Initially, we employ an innovative approach to abstract the wireless network into a homogeneous graph. This primarily focuses on bypassing the heterogeneous features between transmitter (TX) and user entities to construct a virtual homogeneous graph serving optimization objectives, thereby enabling all nodes in the virtual graph to share the same neural network. This ``TX entity'' is known as a base station (BS) in cellular networks and an access point (AP) in cell-free networks. Subsequently, we design a universal graph neural network, termed the information carrying graph neural network (ICGNN), to capture and integrate information from this graph, maintaining permutation invariance. Lastly, using ICGNN as the core algorithm, we tailor the neural network's input and output for specific problem requirements and validate its performance in two scenarios: 1) in cellular networks, we develop a matrix-inverse-free multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) precoding scheme using the conjugate gradient (CG) method, adaptable to varying user and antenna numbers; 2) in a cell-free network, facing dynamic variations in the number of users served by APs, the number of APs serving each user, and the number of antennas per AP, we propose a universal power allocation scheme. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity but also achieves, and potentially exceeds, the spectral efficiency (SE) of conventional algorithms.

Title: vec2wav 2.0: Advancing Voice Conversion via Discrete Token Vocoders
Authors: Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Junjie Li, Chenpeng Du, Hankun Wang, Shuai Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu
Abstract: We propose a new speech discrete token vocoder, vec2wav 2.0, which advances voice conversion (VC). We use discrete tokens from speech self-supervised models as the content features of source speech, and treat VC as a prompted vocoding task. To amend the loss of speaker timbre in the content tokens, vec2wav 2.0 utilizes the WavLM features to provide strong timbre-dependent information. A novel adaptive Snake activation function is proposed to better incorporate timbre into the waveform reconstruction process. In this way, vec2wav 2.0 learns to alter the speaker timbre appropriately given different reference prompts. Also, no supervised data is required for vec2wav 2.0 to be effectively trained. Experimental results demonstrate that vec2wav 2.0 outperforms all other baselines to a considerable margin in terms of audio quality and speaker similarity in any-to-any VC. Ablation studies verify the effects made by the proposed techniques. Moreover, vec2wav 2.0 achieves competitive cross-lingual VC even only trained on monolingual corpus. Thus, vec2wav 2.0 shows timbre can potentially be manipulated only by speech token vocoders, pushing the frontiers of VC and speech synthesis.

Title: RDEIC: Accelerating Diffusion-Based Extreme Image Compression with Relay Residual Diffusion
Authors: Zhiyuan Li, Yanhui Zhou, Hao Wei, Chenyang Ge, Ajmal Mian
Abstract: Diffusion-based extreme image compression methods have achieved impressive performance at extremely low bitrates. However, constrained by the iterative denoising process that starts from pure noise, these methods are limited in both fidelity and efficiency. To address these two issues, we present Relay Residual Diffusion Extreme Image Compression (RDEIC), which leverages compressed feature initialization and residual diffusion. Specifically, we first use the compressed latent features of the image with added noise, instead of pure noise, as the starting point to eliminate the unnecessary initial stages of the denoising process. Second, we directly derive a novel residual diffusion equation from Stable Diffusion's original diffusion equation that reconstructs the raw image by iteratively removing the added noise and the residual between the compressed and target latent features. In this way, we effectively combine the efficiency of residual diffusion with the powerful generative capability of Stable Diffusion. Third, we propose a fixed-step fine-tuning strategy to eliminate the discrepancy between the training and inference phases, thereby further improving the reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RDEIC achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and outperforms existing diffusion-based extreme image compression methods in both fidelity and efficiency.

Title: SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems
Authors: Ismail Alkhouri, Shijun Liang, Cheng-Han Huang, Jimmy Dai, Qing Qu, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Rongrong Wang
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse problems, the reverse sampling steps are modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed step-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly), our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to SOTA baselines, our experiments across several linear and non-linear tasks (with natural and medical images) demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard similarity metrics and run-time.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multitask performance. As a result, researchers have been actively exploring the integration of LLMs into the domain of speech understanding, with a primary focus on a broad range of speech-to-text tasks. These include automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-text translation (ST), speech emotion recognition (SER), and others. We refer to such models as Speech LLMs, which are typically built on a unified architecture that follows the pipeline of Audio Feature Extraction -> Multimodal Information Fusion -> LLM Inference. This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses the advancements in Speech LLMs and their potential for cross-task integration within the speech understanding field. Furthermore, it highlights key challenges identified through experimentation, such as the dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further explores training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposes potential solutions based on these findings, and offers valuable insights and references for future research.

Title: Fast Hyperspectral Neutron Tomography
Authors: Mohammad Samin Nur Chowdhury, Diyu Yang, Shimin Tang, Singanallur V. Venkatakrishnan, Hassina Z. Bilheux, Gregery T. Buzzard, Charles A. Bouman
Abstract: Hyperspectral neutron computed tomography is a tomographic imaging technique in which thousands of wavelength-specific neutron radiographs are measured for each tomographic view. In conventional hyperspectral reconstruction, data from each neutron wavelength bin are reconstructed separately, which is extremely time-consuming. These reconstructions often suffer from poor quality due to low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, material decomposition based on these reconstructions tends to produce inaccurate estimates of the material spectra and erroneous volumetric material separation. In this paper, we present two novel algorithms for processing hyperspectral neutron data: fast hyperspectral reconstruction and fast material decomposition. Both algorithms rely on a subspace decomposition procedure that transforms hyperspectral views into low-dimensional projection views within an intermediate subspace, where tomographic reconstruction is performed. The use of subspace decomposition dramatically reduces reconstruction time while reducing both noise and reconstruction artifacts. We apply our algorithms to both simulated and measured neutron data and demonstrate that they reduce computation and improve the quality of the results relative to conventional methods.

Title: Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising
Authors: Asad Aali, Marius Arvinte, Sidharth Kumar, Yamin I. Arefeen, Jonathan I. Tamir
Abstract: We study the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.

Title: TACO: Training-free Sound Prompted Segmentation via Semantically Constrained Audio-visual CO-factorization
Authors: Hugo Malard, Michel Olvera, Stephane Lathuiliere, Slim Essid
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained audio and image models demonstrate an unprecedented degree of generalization, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here, we tackle the specific task of sound-prompted segmentation, aiming to segment image regions corresponding to objects heard in an audio signal. Most existing approaches tackle this problem by fine-tuning pre-trained models or by training additional modules specifically for the task. We adopt a different strategy: we introduce a training-free approach that leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to co-factorize audio and visual features from pre-trained models so as to reveal shared interpretable concepts. These concepts are passed on to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps. By using frozen pre-trained models, our method achieves high generalization and establishes state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sound-prompted segmentation, significantly surpassing previous unsupervised methods.

Title: Domain-Agnostic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Using Physics-Constrained Synthetic Data
Authors: Liam Chalcroft, Jenny Crinion, Cathy J. Price, John Ashburner
Abstract: Segmenting stroke lesions in MRI is challenging due to diverse acquisition protocols that limit model generalisability. In this work, we introduce two physics-constrained approaches to generate synthetic quantitative MRI (qMRI) images that improve segmentation robustness across heterogeneous domains. Our first method, $\texttt{qATLAS}$, trains a neural network to estimate qMRI maps from standard MPRAGE images, enabling the simulation of varied MRI sequences with realistic tissue contrasts. The second method, $\texttt{qSynth}$, synthesises qMRI maps directly from tissue labels using label-conditioned Gaussian mixture models, ensuring physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on multiple out-of-domain datasets show that both methods outperform a baseline UNet, with $\texttt{qSynth}$ notably surpassing previous synthetic data approaches. These results highlight the promise of integrating MRI physics into synthetic data generation for robust, generalisable stroke lesion segmentation. Code is available at this https URL

Title: High-resolution urban air pollution and thermal comfort mapping: an application of drive mobile sensing platform for smart city services
Authors: Hui Zhong, Hongliang Lu, Ting Gand, Yonghong Liud, Xinhu Zheng
Abstract: Air pollutant exposure exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability, with localized hotspots, particularly in traffic microenvironments, posing health risks to commuters. Although widely used for air quality assessment, fixed-site monitoring stations are limited by sparse distribution, high costs, and maintenance needs, making them less effective in capturing on-road pollution levels. This study utilizes a fleet of 314 taxis equipped with sensors to measure NO\textsubscript{2}, PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and PM\textsubscript{10} concentrations and identify high-exposure hotspots. The findings reveal disparities between mobile and stationary measurements, map the spatiotemporal exposure patterns, and highlight local hotspots. These results demonstrate the potential of mobile monitoring to provide fine-scale, on-road air pollution assessments, offering valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions and protect public health, particularly for sensitive populations.

Title: Cancer-Net PCa-Seg: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models for Prostate Cancer Segmentation Using Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging
Authors: Jarett Dewbury, Chi-en Amy Tai, Alexander Wong
Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men in the United States, accounting for nearly 300,000 cases, 29\% of all diagnoses and 35,000 total deaths in 2024. Traditional screening methods such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been pivotal in diagnosis, but have faced limitations in specificity and generalizability. In this paper, we explore the potential of enhancing PCa gland segmentation using a novel MRI modality called synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$). We employ several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including U-Net, SegResNet, Swin UNETR, Attention U-Net, and LightM-UNet, to segment prostate glands from a 200 CDI$^s$ patient cohort. We find that SegResNet achieved superior segmentation performance with a Dice-Sorensen coefficient (DSC) of $76.68 \pm 0.8$. Notably, the Attention U-Net, while slightly less accurate (DSC $74.82 \pm 2.0$), offered a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in improving prostate gland segmentation using CDI$^s$ to enhance PCa management and clinical support.

Title: Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor
Authors: Jiaqi Guo, Yunan Wu, Evangelos Kaimakamis, Georgios Petmezas, Vasileios E. Papageorgiou, Nicos Maglaveras, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.

Title: Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System for Tumor Layered Diagnosis via Multi-task Semi-supervised Learning
Authors: Yihao Liu, Zhihao Cui, Liming Li, Junjie You, Xinle Feng, Jianxin Wang, Xiangyu Wang, Qing Liu, Minghua Wu
Abstract: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. Multimodal MRI is widely used for the preliminary screening of gliomas and plays a crucial role in auxiliary diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and prognostic evaluation. Currently, the computer-aided diagnostic studies of gliomas using MRI have focused on independent analysis events such as tumor segmentation, grading, and radiogenomic classification, without studying inter-dependencies among these events. In this study, we propose a Glioma Multimodal MRI Analysis System (GMMAS) that utilizes a deep learning network for processing multiple events simultaneously, leveraging their inter-dependencies through an uncertainty-based multi-task learning architecture and synchronously outputting tumor region segmentation, glioma histological subtype, IDH mutation genotype, and 1p/19q chromosome disorder status. Compared with the reported single-task analysis models, GMMAS improves the precision across tumor layered diagnostic tasks. Additionally, we have employed a two-stage semi-supervised learning method, enhancing model performance by fully exploiting both labeled and unlabeled MRI samples. Further, by utilizing an adaptation module based on knowledge self-distillation and contrastive learning for cross-modal feature extraction, GMMAS exhibited robustness in situations of modality absence and revealed the differing significance of each MRI modal. Finally, based on the analysis outputs of the GMMAS, we created a visual and user-friendly platform for doctors and patients, introducing GMMAS-GPT to generate personalized prognosis evaluations and suggestions.

Title: SDM Optical Systems with MMSE Equalizers: Information Rates and Performance Monitoring
Authors: Lucas Alves Zischler, Darli A. A. Mello
Abstract: The information rate of coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems is impaired by the stochastic effects of mode-dependent gain (MDG) and mode-dependent loss (MDL), turning it into a random variable and reducing its average value. In systems operating with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizers and no channel-state information (CSI), co-channel interference further reduces the instantaneous and average information rates. Analytical solutions for the average information rate in MDG- and MDL-impaired systems under strong coupling have been presented in early studies assuming ideal maximum-likelihood (ML) equalization. However, to the best of our knowledge, a solution encompassing co-channel interference under MMSE equalization has not been presented yet. In this work, we derive statistical models for the MMSE equalizer coefficients and develop analytical solutions for the post-filtering information rate. We also use these statistical models and analytical solutions to carry out MDG and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) monitoring in coupled SDM systems. The derived analytical solutions and monitoring techniques are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations, exhibiting a suitable accuracy within practical operational values.

Title: DC-VSR: Spatially and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution with Video Diffusion Prior
Authors: Janghyeok Han, Gyujin Sim, Geonung Kim, Hyun-seung Lee, Kyuha Choi, Youngseok Han, Sunghyun Cho
Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) video from a low-resolution (LR) counterpart. Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.

Title: DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation
Authors: Dongya Jia, Zhuo Chen, Jiawei Chen, Chenpeng Du, Jian Wu, Jian Cong, Xiaobin Zhuang, Chumin Li, Zhen Wei, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.

Title: Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo
Authors: Idan Achituve, Hai Victor Habi, Amir Rosenfeld, Arnon Netzer, Idit Diamant, Ethan Fetaya
Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation operator. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a backward diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks.

Title: Multi-Partite Output Regulation of Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Kürşad Metehan Gül, Selahattin Burak Sarsılmaz
Abstract: This article proposes a simple, graph-independent perspective on partitioning the node set of a graph and provides multi-agent systems (MASs) with objectives beyond cooperation and bipartition. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of $k$-partition transformation to achieve any desired partition of the nodes. Then, we use this notion to formulate the multi-partite output regulation problem (MORP) of heterogeneous linear MASs, which comprises the existing cooperative output regulation problem (CORP) and bipartite output regulation problem (BORP) as subcases. The goal of the MORP is to design a distributed control law such that each follower that belongs to the same set in the partition asymptotically tracks a scalar multiple of the reference while ensuring the internal stability of the closed-loop system. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the MORP with a feedforward-based distributed control law follow from the CORP and lead to the first design strategy for the control parameters. However, it has a drawback in terms of scalability due to a partition-dependent condition. We prove that this condition is implied by its partition-independent version under a mild structural condition. This implication yields the second design strategy that is much more scalable than the first one. Finally, an experiment is conducted to demonstrate the MORP's flexibility, and two numerical examples are provided to illustrate its generality and compare both design strategies regarding scalability.

Title: A Real-World Energy Management Dataset from a Smart Company Building for Optimization and Machine Learning
Authors: Jens Engel, Andrea Castellani, Patricia Wollstadt, Felix Lanfermann, Thomas Schmitt, Sebastian Schmitt, Lydia Fischer, Steffen Limmer, David Luttropp, Florian Jomrich, René Unger, Tobias Rodemann
Abstract: We present a large real-world dataset obtained from monitoring a smart company facility over the course of six years, from 2018 to 2023. The dataset includes energy consumption data from various facility areas and components, energy production data from a photovoltaic system and a combined heat and power plant, operational data from heating and cooling systems, and weather data from an on-site weather station. The measurement sensors installed throughout the facility are organized in a hierarchical metering structure with multiple sub-metering levels, which is reflected in the dataset. The dataset contains measurement data from 72 energy meters, 9 heat meters and a weather station. Both raw and processed data at different processing levels, including labeled issues, is available. In this paper, we describe the data acquisition and post-processing employed to create the dataset. The dataset enables the application of a wide range of methods in the domain of energy management, including optimization, modeling, and machine learning to optimize building operations and reduce costs and carbon emissions.

Title: A Sigma Point-based Low Complexity Algorithm for Multipath-based SLAM in MIMO Systems
Authors: Anna Masiero, Alexander Venus, Erik Leitinger
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach in wireless networks to jointly obtain position information of transmitters/receivers and information of the propagation environment. MP-SLAM models specular reflections at flat surfaces as virtual anchors (VAs), which are mirror images of base stations. Particle-based methods offer high flexibility and can approximate posterior probability density functions of the mobile agent state and the map feature states, (i.e., VA states) with complex shapes. However, they often require a large number of particles to counteract degeneracy in high-dimensional parameter spaces, leading to high computational complexity. Conversely using an insufficient number of particles leads to reduced estimation accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a low-complexity MP-SLAM algorithm using a sigma point (SP)-based implementation of the sum-product algorithm (SPA). We model the messages of continuous states of the agent and the VAs as Gaussian distributions and approximate nonlinearities via SP-transformations. This approach substantially reduces the computational complexity without decreasing accuracy. Since probabilistic data association yields Gaussian mixtures for the agent and VA states, we use moment matching to combine each mixture into a single Gaussian. Numerical results using synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves significantly reduced computational runtimes compared to particle-based schemes, while exhibiting comparable (or even superior) localization and mapping performance.

Title: Conformal Robust Beamforming via Generative Channel Models
Authors: Xin Su, Qiushuo Hou, Ruisi He, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Traditional approaches to outage-constrained beamforming optimization rely on statistical assumptions about channel distributions and estimation errors. However, the resulting outage probability guarantees are only valid when these assumptions accurately reflect reality. This paper tackles the fundamental challenge of providing outage probability guarantees that remain robust regardless of specific channel or estimation error models. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework: (i) construction of a channel uncertainty set using a generative channel model combined with conformal prediction, and (ii) robust beamforming via the solution of a min-max optimization problem. The proposed method separates the modeling and optimization tasks, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and robust decision-making. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the framework in achieving model-agnostic outage guarantees.

Authors: Daniele Gerosa, Rui Hou, Vimar Björk, Ulf Gustavsson, Thomas Eriksson
Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and compensation of stochastic discrete time clock jitter in Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Two novel, computationally efficient de-jittering sample pilots-based algorithms for baseband signals are proposed: one consisting in solving a sequence of weighted least-squares problems and another that fully leverages the correlated jitter structure in a Kalman filter-type routine. Alongside, a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical analysis of the linearization errors committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic simulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and stress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.

Title: An Improved Approach to Estimate the Internal Resistance of a Battery During the HPPC Test
Authors: Prarthana Pillai, Smeet Desai, Krishna R. Pattipati, Balakumar Balasingam
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of resistance estimation in electronic systems including battery management systems (BMS) and battery chargers. In typical applications, the battery resistance is obtained through an approximate method computed as the ratio of the voltage difference to the applied current excitation pulse or vice versa for admittance. When estimating the battery resistance, this approach ignores the change in the open circuit voltage (OCV) as a result of the excitation signal. In this paper, we formally demonstrate and quantify the effect of the OCV drop on the errors in internal resistance estimation. Then, we propose a novel method to accurately estimate the internal resistance by accounting for the change in OCV caused by the applied current excitation signal. The proposed approach is based on a novel observation model that allows one to estimate the effect of OCV without requiring any additional information, such as the state of charge (SOC), parameters of the OCV-SOC curve, and the battery capacity. As such, the proposed approach is independent of the battery chemistry, size, age, and the ambient temperature. A performance analysis of the proposed approach using the battery simulator shows significant performance gain in the range of 30% to more than 250% in percentage estimation error. Then, the proposed approach is applied for resistance estimation during the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) of cylindrical Li-ion battery cells. Results from tested batteries show that the proposed approach reduced the overestimated internal resistance of the batteries by up to 20 m{\Omega}.

Title: Evaluating the Scalability of Binary and Ternary CNN Workloads on RRAM-based Compute-in-Memory Accelerators
Authors: José Cubero-Cascante, Rebecca Pelke, Noah Flohr, Arunkumar Vaidyanathan, Rainer Leupers, Jan Moritz Joseph
Abstract: The increasing computational demand of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) necessitates energy-efficient acceleration strategies. Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures based on Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) offer a promising solution by reducing data movement and enabling low-power in-situ computations. However, their efficiency is limited by the high cost of peripheral circuits, particularly Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Large crossbars and low ADC resolutions are often used to mitigate this, potentially compromising accuracy. This work introduces novel simulation methods to model the impact of resistive wire parasitics and limited ADC resolution on RRAM crossbars. Our parasitics model employs a vectorised algorithm to compute crossbar output currents with errors below 0.15% compared to SPICE. Additionally, we propose a variable step-size ADC and a calibration methodology that significantly reduces ADC resolution requirements. These accuracy models are integrated with a statistics-based energy model. Using our framework, we conduct a comparative analysis of binary and ternary CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the ternary CNNs exhibit greater resilience to wire parasitics and lower ADC resolution but suffer a 40% reduction in energy efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for optimising RRAM-based CIM accelerators for energy-efficient deep learning.

Title: Channel Estimation for Wideband XL-MIMO: A Constrained Deep Unrolling Approach
Authors: Peicong Zheng, Xuantao Lyu, Ye Wang, Yi Gong
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) enables the formation of narrow beams, effectively mitigating path loss in high-frequency communications. This capability makes the integration of wideband high-frequency communications and XL-MIMO a key enabler for future 6G networks. Realizing the full potential of such wideband XL-MIMO systems depends critically on acquiring accurate channel state information. However, channel estimation is significantly challenging due to inherent wideband XL-MIMO channel characteristics, including near-field propagation, beam split, and spatial non-stationarity. To effectively capture these channel characteristics, we formulate channel estimation as a maximum a posteriori problem, which facilitates the use of prior channel knowledge. We then propose an unrolled proximal gradient descent algorithm with learnable step sizes, which employs a dedicated neural network for proximal mapping. This design empowers the proposed algorithm to implicitly learn prior channel knowledge directly from data, thereby eliminating the need for explicit regularization functions. To improve the convergence, we introduce a monotonic descent constraint on the layer-wise estimation error and provide theoretical analyses to characterize the algorithm's convergence behavior. Simulation results show that the proposed unrolling-based algorithm outperforms the traditional and deep learning-based methods.

Title: LipDiffuser: Lip-to-Speech Generation with Conditional Diffusion Models
Authors: Danilo de Oliveira, Julius Richter, Tal Peer, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: We present LipDiffuser, a conditional diffusion model for lip-to-speech generation synthesizing natural and intelligible speech directly from silent video recordings. Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluation confirm the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach.

Title: RainfalLTE: A Zero-effect Rainfall Sensing System Utilizing Existing LTE Infrastructure
Authors: Xianbin Jiang, Fei Shang, Haohua Du, Panlong Yang, Xing Guo, Lihong Liang, Yuanting Zhang, Xiang-Yang Li
Abstract: Environmental sensing is an important research topic in the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Current works often focus on static environments, such as buildings and terrains. However, dynamic factors like rainfall can cause serious interference to wireless signals. In this paper, we propose a system called RainfalLTE that utilizes the downlink signal of LTE base stations for device-independent rain sensing. In articular, it is fully compatible with current communication modes and does not require any additional hardware. We evaluate it with LTE data and rainfall information provided by a weather radar in Badaling Town, Beijing The results show that for 10 classes of rainfall, RainfalLTE achieves over 97% identification accuracy. Our case study shows that the assistance of rainfall information can bring more than 40% energy saving, which provides new opportunities for the design and optimization of ISAC systems.

Title: X-GRM: Large Gaussian Reconstruction Model for Sparse-view X-rays to Computed Tomography
Authors: Yifan Liu, Wuyang Li, Weihao Yu, Chenxin Li, Alexandre Alahi, Max Meng, Yixuan Yuan
Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows, providing non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures. Existing CT reconstruction works are limited to small-capacity model architecture and inflexible volume representation. In this work, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large feedforward model for reconstructing 3D CT volumes from sparse-view 2D X-ray projections. X-GRM employs a scalable transformer-based architecture to encode sparse-view X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views are integrated efficiently. Then, these tokens are decoded into a novel volume representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. This combination of a high-capacity model and flexible volume representation, empowers our model to produce high-quality reconstructions from various testing inputs, including in-domain and out-domain X-ray projections.

Title: On the Relevance of Clinical Assessment Tasks for the Automatic Detection of Parkinson's Disease Medication State from Speech
Authors: David Gimeno-Gómez, Rubén Solera-Ureña, Anna Pompili, Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos, Rita Cardoso, Isabel Guimarães, Joaquim J. Ferreira, Alberto Abad
Abstract: The automatic identification of medication states of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients can assist clinicians in monitoring and scheduling personalized treatments, as well as studying the effects of medication in alleviating the motor symptoms that characterize the disease. This paper explores speech as a non-invasive and accessible biomarker for identifying PD medication states, introducing a novel approach that addresses this task from a speaker-independent perspective. While traditional machine learning models achieve competitive results, self-supervised speech representations prove essential for optimal performance, significantly surpassing knowledge-based acoustic descriptors. Experiments across diverse speech assessment tasks highlight the relevance of prosody and continuous speech in distinguishing medication states, reaching an F1-score of 88.2%. These findings may streamline clinicians' work and reduce patient effort in voice recordings.

Title: ASVspoof2019 vs. ASVspoof5: Assessment and Comparison
Authors: Avishai Weizman, Yehuda Ben-Shimol, Itshak Lapidot
Abstract: ASVspoof challenges are designed to advance the understanding of spoofing speech attacks and encourage the development of robust countermeasure systems. These challenges provide a standardized database for assessing and comparing spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification solutions. The ASVspoof5 challenge introduces a shift in database conditions compared to ASVspoof2019. While ASVspoof2019 has mismatched conditions only in spoofing attacks in the evaluation set, ASVspoof5 incorporates mismatches in both bona fide and spoofed speech statistics. This paper examines the impact of these mismatches, presenting qualitative and quantitative comparisons within and between the two databases. We show the increased difficulty for genuine and spoofed speech and demonstrate that in ASVspoof5, not only are the attacks more challenging, but the genuine speech also shifts toward spoofed speech compared to ASVspoof2019.

Title: OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates
Authors: Jinpei Guo, Yifei Ji, Zheng Chen, Kai Liu, Min Liu, Wang Rao, Wenbo Li, Yong Guo, Yulun Zhang
Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Dysfluent WFST: A Framework for Zero-Shot Speech Dysfluency Transcription and Detection

Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification, provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key to improving dysfluency processing systems.

Title: HPP-Voice: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Speech Embeddings for Multi-Phenotypic Classification
Authors: David Krongauz, Hido Pinto, Sarah Kohn, Yanir Marmor, Eran Segal
Abstract: Human speech contains paralinguistic cues that reflect a speaker's physiological and neurological state, potentially enabling non-invasive detection of various medical phenotypes. We introduce the Human Phenotype Project Voice corpus (HPP-Voice): a dataset of 7,188 recordings in which Hebrew-speaking adults count for 30 seconds, with each speaker linked to up to 15 potentially voice-related phenotypes spanning respiratory, sleep, mental health, metabolic, immune, and neurological conditions. We present a systematic comparison of 14 modern speech embedding models, where modern speech embeddings from these 30-second counting tasks outperform MFCCs and demographics for downstream health condition classifications. We found that embedding learned from a speaker identification model can predict objectively measured moderate to severe sleep apnea in males with an AUC of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.03, while MFCC and demographic features led to AUCs of 0.56 $\pm$ 0.02 and 0.57 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. Additionally, our results reveal gender-specific patterns in model effectiveness across different medical domains. For males, speaker identification and diarization models consistently outperformed speech foundation models for respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma: 0.61 $\pm$ 0.03 vs. 0.56 $\pm$ 0.02) and sleep-related conditions (insomnia: 0.65 $\pm$ 0.04 vs. 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05). For females, speaker diarization models performed best for smoking status (0.61 $\pm$ 0.02 vs 0.55 $\pm$ 0.02), while Hebrew-specific models performed best (0.59 $\pm$ 0.02 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.02) in classifying anxiety compared to speech foundation models. Our findings provide evidence that a simple counting task can support large-scale, multi-phenotypic voice screening and highlight which embedding families generalize best to specific conditions, insights that can guide future vocal biomarker research and clinical deployment.

Title: IAE Optimized PID Tuning via Second Order Step Response Target Matching
Authors: Senol Gulgonul
Abstract: This paper presents SOSTIAE (Second-Order System Target IAE), a novel PID tuning method that combines IAE minimization with explicit transient response shaping for practical control applications. The algorithm generates optimal PID parameters by matching the closed-loop response to a target second-order system with user-defined settling time (Ts) and percent overshoot (PO), while maintaining the conventional IAE performance metric. Comparative evaluations on first to third-order systems demonstrate that SOSTIAE consistently outperforms MATLAB's proprietary pidtune function, achieving 47-67% lower overshoot and up to 26% better IAE performance for higher-order plants. The constrained optimization framework ensures physically realizable controllers by enforcing non-negative PID gains and stability criteria, addressing known limitations of unconstrained IAE methods. Results indicate that SOSTIAE provides engineers with a systematic alternative for PID tuning when transient specifications and practical implementation constraints are critical.

Title: SUFFICIENT: A scan-specific unsupervised deep learning framework for high-resolution 3D isotropic fetal brain MRI reconstruction
Authors: Jiangjie Wu, Lixuan Chen, Zhenghao Li, Xin Li, Saban Ozturk, Lihui Wang, Rongpin Wang, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang
Abstract: High-quality 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis. Reliable slice-to-volume registration (SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods are essential. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing SVR and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.

Title: Distortion Resilience for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication
Authors: Minh-Duong Nguyen, Quang-Vinh Do, Zhaohui Yang, Quoc-Viet Pham, Won-Joo Hwang
Abstract: Recent research efforts on Semantic Communication (SemCom) have mostly considered accuracy as a main problem for optimizing goal-oriented communication systems. However, these approaches introduce a paradox: the accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks should naturally emerge through training rather than being dictated by network constraints. Acknowledging this dilemma, this work introduces an innovative approach that leverages the rate distortion theory to analyze distortions induced by communication and compression, thereby analyzing the learning process. Specifically, we examine the distribution shift between the original data and the distorted data, thus assessing its impact on the AI model's performance. Founding upon this analysis, we can preemptively estimate the empirical accuracy of AI tasks, making the goal-oriented SemCom problem feasible. To achieve this objective, we present the theoretical foundation of our approach, accompanied by simulations and experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method enables accurate AI task performance while adhering to network constraints, establishing it as a valuable contribution to the field of signal processing. Furthermore, this work advances research in goal-oriented SemCom and highlights the significance of data-driven approaches in optimizing the performance of intelligent systems.

Title: Linearization of ReLU Activation Function for Neural Network-Embedded Optimization: Optimal Day-Ahead Energy Scheduling
Authors: Cunzhi Zhao, Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li
Abstract: Recently, neural networks have been widely applied in the power system area. They can be used for better predicting input information and modeling system performance with increased accuracy. In some applications such as battery degradation neural network-based microgrid day-ahead energy scheduling, the input features of the trained learning model are variables to be solved in optimization models that enforce limits on the output of the same learning model. This will create a neural network-embedded optimization problem; the use of nonlinear activation functions in the neural network will make such problems extremely hard to solve if not unsolvable. To address this emerging challenge, this paper investigated different methods for linearizing the nonlinear activation functions with a particular focus on the widely used rectified linear unit (ReLU) function. Four linearization methods tailored for the ReLU activation function are developed, analyzed and compared in this paper. Each method employs a set of linear constraints to replace the ReLU function, effectively linearizing the optimization problem, which can overcome the computational challenges associated with the nonlinearity of the neural network model. These proposed linearization methods provide valuable tools for effectively solving optimization problems that integrate neural network models with ReLU activation functions

Title: A Novel Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Learning Method to Enhance Photoplethysmogram Signal Artifact Detection
Authors: Thanh-Dung Le, Clara Macabiau, Kévin Albert, Philippe Jouvet, Rita Noumeir
Abstract: Recent research at CHU Sainte Justine's Pediatric Critical Care Unit (PICU) has revealed that traditional machine learning methods, such as semi-supervised label propagation and K-nearest neighbors, outperform Transformer-based models in artifact detection from PPG signals, mainly when data is limited. This study addresses the underutilization of abundant unlabeled data by employing self-supervised learning (SSL) to extract latent features from these data, followed by fine-tuning on labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly enhances the Transformer model's ability to learn representations, improving its robustness in artifact classification tasks. Among various SSL techniques, including masking, contrastive learning, and DINO (self-distillation with no labels)-contrastive learning exhibited the most stable and superior performance in small PPG datasets. Further, we delve into optimizing contrastive loss functions, which are crucial for contrastive SSL. Inspired by InfoNCE, we introduce a novel contrastive loss function that facilitates smoother training and better convergence, thereby enhancing performance in artifact classification. In summary, this study establishes the efficacy of SSL in leveraging unlabeled data, particularly in enhancing the capabilities of the Transformer model. This approach holds promise for broader applications in PICU environments, where annotated data is often limited.

Title: PITCH: AI-assisted Tagging of Deepfake Audio Calls using Challenge-Response
Authors: Govind Mittal, Arthur Jakobsson, Kelly O. Marshall, Chinmay Hegde, Nasir Memon
Abstract: The rise of AI voice-cloning technology, particularly audio Real-time Deepfakes (RTDFs), has intensified social engineering attacks by enabling real-time voice impersonation that bypasses conventional enrollment-based authentication. This technology represents an existential threat to phone-based authentication systems, while total identity fraud losses reached $43 billion. Unlike traditional robocalls, these personalized AI-generated voice attacks target high-value accounts and circumvent existing defensive measures, creating an urgent cybersecurity challenge. To address this, we propose PITCH, a robust challenge-response method to detect and tag interactive deepfake audio calls. We developed a comprehensive taxonomy of audio challenges based on the human auditory system, linguistics, and environmental factors, yielding 20 prospective challenges. Testing against leading voice-cloning systems using a novel dataset (18,600 original and 1.6 million deepfake samples from 100 users), PITCH's challenges enhanced machine detection capabilities to 88.7% AUROC score, enabling us to identify 10 highly-effective challenges. For human evaluation, we filtered a challenging, balanced subset on which human evaluators independently achieved 72.6% accuracy, while machines scored 87.7%. Recognizing that call environments require human control, we developed a novel human-AI collaborative system that tags suspicious calls as "Deepfake-likely." Contrary to prior findings, we discovered that integrating human intuition with machine precision offers complementary advantages, giving users maximum control while boosting detection accuracy to 84.5%. This significant improvement situates PITCH's potential as an AI-assisted pre-screener for verifying calls, offering an adaptable approach to combat real-time voice-cloning attacks while maintaining human decision authority.

Title: Modulated differentiable STFT and balanced spectrum metric for freight train wheelset bearing cross-machine transfer monitoring under speed fluctuations
Authors: Chao He, Hongmei Shi, Ruixin Li, Jianbo Li, ZuJun Yu
Abstract: The service conditions of wheelset bearings has a direct impact on the safe operation of railway heavy haul freight trains as the key components. However, speed fluctuation of the trains and few fault samples are the two main problems that restrict the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, a cross-machine transfer diagnosis (pyDSN) network coupled with interpretable modulated differentiable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and physics-informed balanced spectrum quality metric is proposed to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features under time-varying speeds. Firstly, due to insufficiency in extracting extract frequency components of time-varying speed signals using fixed windows, a modulated differentiable STFT (MDSTFT) that is interpretable with STFT-informed theoretical support, is proposed to extract the robust time-frequency spectrum (TFS). During training process, multiple windows with different lengths dynamically change. Also, in addition to the classification metric and domain discrepancy metric, we creatively introduce a third kind of metric, referred to as the physics-informed metric, to enhance transferable TFS. A physics-informed balanced spectrum quality (BSQ) regularization loss is devised to guide an optimization direction for MDSTFT and model. With it, not only can model acquire high-quality TFS, but also a physics-restricted domain adaptation network can be also acquired, making it learn real-world physics knowledge, ultimately diminish the domain discrepancy across different datasets. The experiment is conducted in the scenario of migrating from the laboratory datasets to the freight train dataset, indicating that the hybrid-driven pyDSN outperforms existing methods and has practical value.

Title: Revealing the evanescent components in Kronecker-product based codebooks: insights and implications
Authors: Jun Yang, Yijian Chen, Yunqi Sun, Yuan Si, Hongkang Yu, Shujuan Zhang, Zhaohua Lu
Abstract: The orthogonal bases of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has been recognized as the standard spatial-domain bases for Type I, Type II and enhanced Type II codewords by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). For uniform planar arrays, these spatial-domain bases are derived as the Kronecker product of one-dimensional DFT bases. Theoretically, each spatial basis corresponds to a beam directed towards a specific angle of departure and the set of bases represent the orthogonal beams that cover the front hemisphere of an array. While the Kronecker-product based precoding scheme facilitates the concise indexing of a codeword in the codebooks through precoding matrix indicators (PMIs) in channel state information feedback, it introduces redundant spatial beams characterized by high spatial-frequency components. This paper investigates the presence of codewords representing high spatial-frequency components within the Kronecker-product based codebooks. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we confirm the redundancy of these codewords in MIMO communications, advocating for their removal from the codebooks to enhance system performance. Several topics relevant to the high spatial components are also involved in the discussion. Practical suggestions regarding future standard design are provided based on our theoretical analysis and simulation results.

Title: The Impact of LoRA Adapters for LLMs on Clinical NLP Classification Under Data Limitations
Authors: Thanh-Dung Le, Ti Ti Nguyen, Vu Nguyen Ha, Symeon Chatzinotas, Philippe Jouvet, Rita Noumeir
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to the domain gap and limited data availability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various adapter techniques, equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for fine-tuning LLMs in a resource-constrained hospital environment. We experimented with four structures-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN)-as final layers for clinical notes classification. We fine-tuned biomedical pre-trained models, including CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, and DrBERT, alongside two Transformer-based models. Our extensive experimental results indicate that i) employing adapter structures does not yield significant improvements in fine-tuning biomedical pre-trained LLMs, and ii) simpler Transformer-based models, trained from scratch, perform better under resource constraints. Among the adapter structures, GRN demonstrated superior performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, the total training time for LLMs exceeded 1000 hours, compared to under 6 hours for simpler transformer-based models, highlighting that LLMs are more suitable for environments with extensive computational resources and larger datasets. Consequently, this study demonstrates that simpler Transformer-based models can be effectively trained from scratch, providing a viable solution for clinical NLP tasks in low-resource environments with limited data availability. By identifying the GRN as the most effective adapter structure, we offer a practical approach to enhance clinical note classification without requiring extensive computational resources.

Title: Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning: Algorithms and Sample Complexity
Authors: Mohammad Boveiri, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the optimal Q-function of $\gamma$-discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the synchronous setting, where independent samples for all state-action pairs are drawn from a generative model at each iteration. We introduce and analyze a novel model-free algorithm called Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning (VRCQ). VRCQ comprises two key building blocks: (i) the established direct variance reduction technique and (ii) our proposed variance reduction scheme, Cascade Q-learning. By leveraging these techniques, VRCQ provides superior guarantees in the $\ell_\infty$-norm compared with the existing model-free stochastic approximation-type algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate that VRCQ is minimax optimal. Additionally, when the action set is a singleton (so that the Q-learning problem reduces to policy evaluation), it achieves non-asymptotic instance optimality while requiring the minimum number of samples theoretically possible. Our theoretical results and their practical implications are supported by numerical experiments.

Title: (Un)supervised Learning of Maximal Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Matthieu Barreau, Nicola Bastianello
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of discovering maximal Lyapunov functions, as a means of determining the region of attraction of a dynamical system. To this end, we design a novel neural network architecture, which we prove to be a universal approximator of (maximal) Lyapunov functions. The architecture combines a local quadratic approximation with the output of a neural network, which models global higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion. We formulate the problem of training the Lyapunov function as an unsupervised optimization problem with dynamical constraints, which can be solved leveraging techniques from physics-informed learning. We propose and analyze a tailored training algorithm, based on the primal-dual algorithm, that can efficiently solve the problem. Additionally, we show how the learning problem formulation can be adapted to integrate data, when available. We apply the proposed approach to different classes of systems, showing that it matches or outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in the accuracy of the approximated regions of attraction.

Title: The Faetar Benchmark: Speech Recognition in a Very Under-Resourced Language
Authors: Michael Ong, Sean Robertson, Leo Peckham, Alba Jorquera Jimenez de Aberasturi, Paula Arkhangorodsky, Robin Huo, Aman Sakhardande, Mark Hallap, Naomi Nagy, Ewan Dunbar
Abstract: We introduce the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark, a benchmark corpus designed to push the limits of current approaches to low-resource speech recognition. Faetar, a Franco-Provençal variety spoken primarily in Italy, has no standard orthography, has virtually no existing textual or speech resources other than what is included in the benchmark, and is quite different from other forms of Franco-Provençal. The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set.

Title: Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning
Authors: Adit Jain, Vikram Krishnamurthy
Abstract: This paper discusses the theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making involving interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from both prior decisions and external inputs, they can exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) Bayesian utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our proposed models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under 2 settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like LLaMA and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.

Title: Semantic-Aware Resource Management for C-V2X Platooning via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Wenjun Zhang, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Semantic communication transmits the extracted features of information rather than raw data, significantly reducing redundancy, which is crucial for addressing spectrum and energy challenges in 6G networks. In this paper, we introduce semantic communication into a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X)- based autonomous vehicle platoon system for the first time, aiming to achieve efficient management of communication resources in a dynamic environment. Firstly, we construct a mathematical model for semantic communication in platoon systems, in which the DeepSC model and MU-DeepSC model are used to semantically encode and decode unimodal and multi-modal data, respectively. Then, we propose the quality of experience (QoE) metric based on semantic similarity and semantic rate. Meanwhile, we consider the success rate of semantic information transmission (SRS) metric to ensure the fairness of channel resource allocation. Next, the optimization problem is posed with the aim of maximizing the QoE in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links while improving SRS. To solve this mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) and adapt to time-varying channel conditions, the paper proposes a distributed semantic-aware multi-modal resource allocation (SAMRA) algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), referred to as SAMRAMARL. The algorithm can dynamically allocate channels and power and determine semantic symbol length based on the contextual importance of the transmitted information, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Finally, extensive simulations have demonstrated that SAMRAMARL outperforms existing methods, achieving significant gains in QoE, SRS, and communication delay in C-V2X platooning scenarios.

Title: DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method
Authors: Zihao Chen, Zhentao Lin, Bi Zeng, Linyi Huang, Zhi Li, Jia Cai
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at this https URL.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Hybrid Bit and Generative Semantic Communications in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Chong Huang, Xuyang Chen, Gaojie Chen, Pei Xiao, Geoffrey Ye Li, Wei Huang
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework consisting of hybrid bit-level and generative semantic communications for efficient downlink image transmission within space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.

Title: LinGen: Towards High-Resolution Minute-Length Text-to-Video Generation with Linear Computational Complexity
Authors: Hongjie Wang, Chih-Yao Ma, Yen-Cheng Liu, Ji Hou, Tao Xu, Jialiang Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Yaqiao Luo, Peizhao Zhang, Tingbo Hou, Peter Vajda, Niraj K. Jha, Xiaoliang Dai
Abstract: Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation. We provide 68s video generation results and more examples in our project website: this https URL.

Title: Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking
Authors: Tianqi Ren, Rongpeng Li, Ming-min Zhao, Xianfu Chen, Guangyi Liu, Yang Yang, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang
Abstract: Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!

Title: Bridging The Multi-Modality Gaps of Audio, Visual and Linguistic for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Meng-Ping Lin, Jen-Cheng Hou, Chia-Wei Chen, Shao-Yi Chien, Jun-Cheng Chen, Xugang Lu, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) aims to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech in noisy environments. Recent studies have shown that incorporating visual cues in audio signal processing can enhance SE performance. Given that human speech communication naturally involves audio, visual, and linguistic modalities, it is reasonable to expect additional improvements by integrating linguistic information. However, effectively bridging these modality gaps, particularly during knowledge transfer remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework, termed DLAV-SE, which leverages a diffusion-based model integrating audio, visual, and linguistic information for audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE). Within this framework, the linguistic modality is modeled using a pretrained language model (PLM), which transfers linguistic knowledge to the audio-visual domain through a cross-modal knowledge transfer (CMKT) mechanism during training. After training, the PLM is no longer required at inference, as its knowledge is embedded into the AVSE model through the CMKT process. We conduct a series of SE experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that the proposed DLAV-SE system significantly improves speech quality and reduces generative artifacts, such as phonetic confusion, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, visualization analyses confirm that the CMKT method enhances the generation quality of the AVSE outputs. These findings highlight both the promise of diffusion-based methods for advancing AVSE and the value of incorporating linguistic information to further improve system performance.

Title: Jailbreak-AudioBench: In-Depth Evaluation and Analysis of Jailbreak Threats for Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Hao Cheng, Erjia Xiao, Jing Shao, Yichi Wang, Le Yang, Chao Sheng, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant security risks, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific Jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also a range of audio editing techniques. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs, establishing the most comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark to date. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.

Title: Deep Active Speech Cancellation with Mamba-Masking Network
Authors: Yehuda Mishaly, Lior Wolf, Eliya Nachmani
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning network for Active Speech Cancellation (ASC), advancing beyond Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) methods by effectively canceling both noise and speech signals. The proposed Mamba-Masking architecture introduces a masking mechanism that directly interacts with the encoded reference signal, enabling adaptive and precisely aligned anti-signal generation-even under rapidly changing, high-frequency conditions, as commonly found in speech. Complementing this, a multi-band segmentation strategy further improves phase alignment across frequency bands. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven loss function that provides near-optimal supervisory signals for anti-signal generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, achieving up to 7.2dB improvement in ANC scenarios and 6.2dB in ASC, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Title: TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models
Authors: Seungheon Doh, Keunwoo Choi, Juhan Nam
Abstract: We present TALKPLAY, a novel multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates recommendation as a token generation problem using large language models (LLMs). By leveraging the instruction-following and natural language generation capabilities of LLMs, our system effectively recommends music from diverse user queries while generating contextually relevant responses. While pretrained LLMs are primarily designed for text modality, TALKPLAY extends their scope through two key innovations: a multimodal music tokenizer that encodes audio features, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence signals; and a vocabulary expansion mechanism that enables unified processing and generation of both linguistic and music-relevant tokens. By integrating the recommendation system directly into the LLM architecture, TALKPLAY transforms conventional systems by: (1) unifying previous two-stage conversational recommendation systems (recommendation engines and dialogue managers) into a cohesive end-to-end system, (2) effectively utilizing long conversational context for recommendation while maintaining strong performance in extended multi-turn interactions, and (3) generating natural language responses for seamless user interaction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that TALKPLAY significantly outperforms unimodal approaches based solely on text or listening history in both recommendation performance and conversational naturalness.

Abstract: In this work, we upgrade FireRedTTS to a new version, FireRedTTS-1S, a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming speech generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way. We implement two approaches to achieve this module: 1) a chunk-wise streamable flow-matching approach, and 2) a multi-stream language model-based approach. They both present high-quality and streamable speech generation but differ in real-time factor (RTF) and latency. Specifically, flow-matching decoding can generate speech by chunks, presenting a lower RTF of 0.1 but a higher latency of 300ms. Instead, the multi-stream language model generates speech by frames in an autoregressive manner, presenting a higher RTF of 0.3 but a low latency of 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.

Title: Adaptive Sensor Steering Strategy Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Data Acquisition in Digital Twins
Authors: Collins O. Ogbodo, Timothy J. Rogers, Mattia Dal Borgo, David J. Wagg
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensor steering methodology based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy and decision support capabilities of digital twins by optimising the data acquisition process. Traditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off optimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online applications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor placement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment of an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the evolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital twin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and reliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is validated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever plate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement learning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data acquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.

Title: Future-Oriented Navigation: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with One-Shot Energy-Based Multimodal Motion Prediction
Authors: Ze Zhang, Georg Hess, Junjie Hu, Emmanuel Dean, Lennart Svensson, Knut Åkesson
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Title: Dual Acceleration for Minimax Optimization: Linear Convergence Under Relaxed Assumptions
Authors: Jingwang Li, Xiao Li
Abstract: This paper addresses the bilinearly coupled minimax optimization problem: $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}}\max_{y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_y}} \ f_1(x) + f_2(x) + y^{\top} Bx - g_1(y) - g_2(y)$, where $f_1$ and $g_1$ are smooth convex functions, $f_2$ and $g_2$ are potentially nonsmooth convex functions, and $B$ is a coupling matrix. Existing algorithms for solving this problem achieve linear convergence only under stronger conditions, which may not be met in many scenarios. We first introduce the Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient (PDPG) method and demonstrate that it converges linearly under an assumption where existing algorithms fail to achieve linear convergence. Building on insights gained from analyzing the convergence conditions of existing algorithms and PDPG, we further propose the inexact Dual Accelerated Proximal Gradient (iDAPG) method. This method achieves linear convergence under weaker conditions than those required by existing approaches. Moreover, even in cases where existing methods guarantee linear convergence, iDAPG can still provide superior theoretical performance in certain scenarios.

Title: SepALM: Audio Language Models Are Error Correctors for Robust Speech Separation
Authors: Zhaoxi Mu, Xinyu Yang, Gang Wang
Abstract: While contemporary speech separation technologies adeptly process lengthy mixed audio waveforms, they are frequently challenged by the intricacies of real-world environments, including noisy and reverberant settings, which can result in artifacts or distortions in the separated speech. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SepALM, a pioneering approach that employs audio language models (ALMs) to rectify and re-synthesize speech within the text domain following preliminary separation. SepALM comprises four core components: a separator, a corrector, a synthesizer, and an aligner. By integrating an ALM-based end-to-end error correction mechanism, we mitigate the risk of error accumulation and circumvent the optimization hurdles typically encountered in conventional methods that amalgamate automatic speech recognition (ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we have developed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and knowledge distillation techniques to facilitate the reasoning and training processes of the ALM. Our experiments substantiate that SepALM not only elevates the precision of speech separation but also markedly bolsters adaptability in novel acoustic environments.

Title: Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates
Authors: Rodrigo Diaz, Mark Sandler
Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von Kármán plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.

Title: Revenue Optimization in Video Caching Networks with Privacy-Preserving Demand Predictions
Authors: Yijing Zhang, Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: Performance of video streaming, which accounts for most of the traffic in wireless communication, can be significantly improved by caching popular videos at the wireless edge. Determining the cache content that optimizes performance (defined via a revenue function) is thus an important task, and prediction of the future demands based on past history can make this process much more efficient. However, since practical video caching networks involve various parties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such as past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required. Motivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users' privacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a trained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a privacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot future demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and decreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the impact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we formulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement decisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to efficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that (i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized (non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide different solutions than the classical chr criterion.

Title: Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks based Video Enhancement
Authors: Kağan ÇETİN
Abstract: This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.

Title: GraphemeAug: A Systematic Approach to Synthesized Hard Negative Keyword Spotting Examples
Authors: Harry Zhang, Kurt Partridge, Pai Zhu, Neng Chen, Hyun Jin Park, Dhruuv Agarwal, Quan Wang
Abstract: Spoken Keyword Spotting (KWS) is the task of distinguishing between the presence and absence of a keyword in audio. The accuracy of a KWS model hinges on its ability to correctly classify examples close to the keyword and non-keyword boundary. These boundary examples are often scarce in training data, limiting model performance. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically generate adversarial examples close to the decision boundary by making insertion/deletion/substitution edits on the keyword's graphemes. We evaluate this technique on held-out data for a popular keyword and show that the technique improves AUC on a dataset of synthetic hard negatives by 61% while maintaining quality on positives and ambient negative audio data.

Title: "Alexa, can you forget me?" Machine Unlearning Benchmark in Spoken Language Understanding
Authors: Alkis Koudounas, Claudio Savelli, Flavio Giobergia, Elena Baralis
Abstract: Machine unlearning, the process of efficiently removing specific information from machine learning models, is a growing area of interest for responsible AI. However, few studies have explored the effectiveness of unlearning methods on complex tasks, particularly speech-related ones. This paper introduces UnSLU-BENCH, the first benchmark for machine unlearning in spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on four datasets spanning four languages. We address the unlearning of data from specific speakers as a way to evaluate the quality of potential "right to be forgotten" requests. We assess eight unlearning techniques and propose a novel metric to simultaneously better capture their efficacy, utility, and efficiency. UnSLU-BENCH sets a foundation for unlearning in SLU and reveals significant differences in the effectiveness and computational feasibility of various techniques.

Title: Proactive Hierarchical Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Prioritization in Close Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios
Authors: Patanjali Maithani, Aliasghar Arab, Farshad Khorrami, Prashanth Krishnamurthy
Abstract: In collaborative human-robot environments, the unpredictable and dynamic nature of human motion can lead to situations where collisions become unavoidable. In such cases, it is essential for the robotic system to proactively mitigate potential harm through intelligent control strategies. This paper presents a hierarchical control framework based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) designed to ensure safe and adaptive operation of autonomous robotic manipulators during close-proximity human-robot interaction. The proposed method introduces a relaxation variable that enables real-time prioritization of safety constraints, allowing the robot to dynamically manage collision risks based on the criticality of different parts of the human body. A secondary constraint mechanism is incorporated to resolve infeasibility by increasing the priority of imminent threats. The framework is experimentally validated on a Franka Research 3 robot equipped with a ZED2i AI camera for real-time human pose and body detection. Experimental results confirm that the CBF-based controller, integrated with depth sensing, facilitates responsive and safe human-robot collaboration, while providing detailed risk analysis and maintaining robust performance in highly dynamic settings.

Title: Large Language Models based ASR Error Correction for Child Conversations
Authors: Anfeng Xu, Tiantian Feng, So Hyun Kim, Somer Bishop, Catherine Lord, Shrikanth Narayanan
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress, but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

Title: LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols
Authors: Ziming Liu, Bryan Liu, Alvaro Valcarce, Xiaoli Chu
Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous, cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for future AI-native wireless standards.

Title: Semantic-Aware Interpretable Multimodal Music Auto-Tagging
Authors: Andreas Patakis, Vassilis Lyberatos, Spyridon Kantarelis, Edmund Dervakos, Giorgos Stamou
Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing, deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric music tagging systems.

Title: DualTalk: Dual-Speaker Interaction for 3D Talking Head Conversations
Authors: Ziqiao Peng, Yanbo Fan, Haoyu Wu, Xuan Wang, Hongyan Liu, Jun He, Zhaoxin Fan
Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations.
