Title: Application of the learning from errors principle in tufting machines
Authors: Longxiang Shao, Dominik Huesener, Michael Schluse, Juergen Rossmann
Abstract: The principle of learning from errors is pedagogically powerful but often impractical in industrial settings due to risks to safety and equipment. This paper presents an integrated training approach specifically designed for tufting machine operators. It uses hybrid digital twins, augmented reality (AR), and Petri Net-based modelling to apply the learning from errors principle effectively. Operator actions and errors are simulated via experimentable digital twins (EDTs), and the consequences of errors are visualized in AR, enabling safe, experiential learning. A Petri Net model formally represents the process, including typical faults and recovery paths, and is implemented in VEROSIM using SOML++. This hybrid framework provides a scalable foundation for AR-guided training systems that reduce risk and accelerate skill acquisition.

Title: AFDM for LEO Inter-Satellite Links: Path-Level CSI Prediction and CRLB-Guided Pre-Equalization
Authors: Houtianfu Wang, Ozgur Akan
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) inter-satellite links must cope with strongly doubly selective channels and aged channel state information (CSI). In this paper, the term ``sensing'' refers to the receiver-side identifiability of a small set of dominant delay--Doppler path parameters, quantified via CRLB-type proxies, rather than a full-fledged target-sensing pipeline. Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a sparse delay--Doppler (DD) representation well suited to such channels, yet most existing AFDM designs assume ideal CSI, operate on grid-based channel coefficients, and optimize only communication performance. This paper proposes a two-stage AFDM-based ISAC framework for mobile LEO ISLs that explicitly operates under predicted CSI. In Stage~I, we model the channel by a small number of dominant specular paths and perform sequence prediction directly on their complex gains, delays, and Dopplers, from which we reconstruct the AFDM DD-domain kernel used as the sole instantaneous CSI at the transmitter. In Stage~II, we design a sensing-aware AFDM pre-equalizer by augmenting the classical minimum mean-square error (MMSE) solution with a term obtained from Cramér--Rao-type sensitivity measures evaluated under the predicted channel model, leading to a first-order surrogate of a CRLB-regularized pre-equalizer with a single tuning parameter that controls the communication--sensing tradeoff. Simulation results for representative LEO ISL trajectories show that the proposed path-level predictor improves effective-kernel reconstruction over AFDM-unaware baselines, and that, under predicted CSI, the sensing-aware pre-equalizer significantly improves sensing-oriented metrics over outdated-CSI baselines while keeping symbol error rates close to a communication-oriented MMSE design with only modest additional complexity.

Title: Environment-to-Link ISAC with Space-Weather Sensing for Ka-Band LEO Downlinks
Authors: Houtianfu Wang, Haofan Dong, Hanlin Cai, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: Ka-band low-Earth-orbit (LEO) downlinks can suffer second-scale reliability collapses during flare-driven ionospheric disturbances, where fixed fade margins and reactive adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) are either overly conservative or too slow. This paper presents a GNSS-free, link-internal predictive controller that senses the same downlink via a geometry-free dual-carrier phase observable at 10~Hz: a high-pass filter and template-based onset detector, followed by a four-state nearly-constant-velocity Kalman filter, estimate $\Delta$VTEC and its rate, and a short look-ahead (60~s) yields an endpoint outage probability used as a risk gate to trigger one-step discrete MCS down-switch and pilot-time update with hysteresis. Evaluation uses physics-informed log replay driven by real GOES X-ray flare morphologies under a disjoint-day frozen-calibration protocol, with uncertainty reported via paired moving-block bootstrap. Across stressed 60~s windows, the controller reduces peak BLER by 25--30\% and increases goodput by 0.10--0.15~bps/Hz versus no-adaptation baselines under a unified link-level abstraction. The loop runs in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ per 0.1~s epoch (about 0.042~ms measured), making on-board implementation feasible, and scope and deployment considerations for dispersion-dominated events are discussed.

Title: Speak the Art: A Direct Speech to Image Generation Framework
Authors: Mariam Saeed, Manar Amr, Farida Adel, Nada Hassan, Nour Walid, Eman Mohamed, Mohamed Hussein, Marwan Torki
Abstract: Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called \textbf{Speak the Art (STA)} which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.

Title: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Detection using Multimodal Deep Learning
Authors: Sumaiya Ali, Areej Alhothali, Sameera Albasri, Ohoud Alzamzami, Ahmed Abduljabbar, Muhammad Alwazzan
Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a life-threatening obstetric complication involving abnormal placental invasion into the uterine wall. Early and accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential to reduce maternal and neonatal risks. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning framework that enhances PAS detection by integrating multiple imaging modalities. A multimodal deep learning model was designed using an intermediate feature-level fusion architecture combining 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 2D Ultrasound (US) scans. Unimodal feature extractors, a 3D DenseNet121-Vision Transformer for MRI and a 2D ResNet50 for US, were selected after systematic comparative analysis. Curated datasets comprising 1,293 MRI and 1,143 US scans were used to train the unimodal models and paired samples of patient-matched MRI-US scans was isolated for multimodal model development and evaluation. On an independent test set, the multimodal fusion model achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 92.5% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.927, outperforming the MRI-only (82.5%, AUC 0.825) and US-only (87.5%, AUC 0.879) models. Integrating MRI and US features provides complementary diagnostic information, demonstrating strong potential to enhance prenatal risk assessment and improve patient outcomes.

Title: MetaFormer-driven Encoding Network for Robust Medical Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Le-Anh Tran, Chung Nguyen Tran, Nhan Cach Dang, Anh Le Van Quoc, Jordi Carrabina, David Castells-Rufas, Minh Son Nguyen
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for medical image analysis, enabling precise disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many advanced models employ complex architectures, limiting their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. This paper proposes MFEnNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework that incorporates MetaFormer in the encoding phase of the U-Net backbone. MetaFormer, an architectural abstraction of vision transformers, provides a versatile alternative to convolutional neural networks by transforming tokenized image patches into sequences for global context modeling. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with self-attention, the proposed framework replaces conventional transformer modules with pooling transformer blocks, thereby achieving effective global feature aggregation at reduced complexity. In addition, Swish activation is used to achieve smoother gradients and faster convergence, while spatial pyramid pooling is incorporated at the bottleneck to improve multi-scale feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on different medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MFEnNet approach attains competitive accuracy while significantly lowering computational cost compared to state-of-the-art models.

Title: Improving Code-Switching Speech Recognition with TTS Data Augmentation
Authors: Yue Heng Yeo, Yuchen Hu, Shreyas Gopal, Yizhou Peng, Hexin Liu, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational code-switching speech remains challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, high-quality labeled speech data. This paper explores multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) models as an effective data augmentation technique to address this shortage. Specifically, we fine-tune the multilingual CosyVoice2 TTS model on the SEAME dataset to generate synthetic conversational Chinese-English code-switching speech, significantly increasing the quantity and speaker diversity of available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that augmenting real speech with synthetic speech reduces the mixed error rate (MER) from 12.1 percent to 10.1 percent on DevMan and from 17.8 percent to 16.0 percent on DevSGE, indicating consistent performance gains. These results confirm that multilingual TTS is an effective and practical tool for enhancing ASR robustness in low-resource conversational code-switching scenarios.

Title: Learned Hemodynamic Coupling Inference in Resting-State Functional MRI
Authors: William Consagra, Eardi Lila
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an indirect measurement of neuronal activity via hemodynamic responses that vary across brain regions and individuals. Ignoring this hemodynamic variability can bias downstream connectivity estimates. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters themselves may serve as important imaging biomarkers. Estimating spatially varying hemodynamics from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is therefore an important but challenging blind inverse problem, since both the latent neural activity and the hemodynamic coupling are unknown. In this work, we propose a methodology for inferring hemodynamic coupling on the cortical surface from rsfMRI. Our approach avoids the highly unstable joint recovery of neural activity and hemodynamics by marginalizing out the latent neural signal and basing inference on the resulting marginal likelihood. To enable scalable, high-resolution estimation, we employ a deep neural network combined with conditional normalizing flows to accurately approximate this intractable marginal likelihood, while enforcing spatial coherence through priors defined on the cortical surface that admit sparse representations. The proposed approach is extensively validated using synthetic data and real fMRI datasets, demonstrating clear improvements over current methods for hemodynamic estimation and downstream connectivity analysis.

Title: Uncertainty-Calibrated Explainable AI for Fetal Ultrasound Plane Classification
Authors: Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard-plane classification underpins reliable prenatal biometry and anomaly screening, yet real-world deployment is limited by domain shift, image noise, and poor calibration of predicted probabilities. This paper presents a practical framework for uncertainty-calibrated explainable AI in fetal plane classification. We synthesize uncertainty estimation methods (Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, evidential learning, and conformal prediction) with post-hoc and uncertainty-aware explanations (Grad-CAM variants, LIME-style local surrogates, and uncertainty-weighted multi-resolution activation maps), and we map these components to a clinician-facing workflow. Using FETAL_PLANES_DB as a reference benchmark, we define a reporting protocol that couples accuracy with calibration and selective prediction, including expected calibration error, Brier score, coverage-risk curves, and structured error analysis with explanations. We also discuss integration points for quality control and human-in-the-loop review, where uncertainty flags trigger re-acquisition or expert confirmation. The goal is a reproducible, clinically aligned blueprint for building fetal ultrasound classifiers whose confidence and explanations remain trustworthy under noisy acquisition conditions.

Title: Dynamic Accuracy Estimation in a Wi-Fi-based Positioning System
Authors: Marcin Kolakowski, Vitomir Djaja-Josko
Abstract: The paper presents a concept of a dynamic accuracy estimation method, in which the localization errors are derived based on the measurement results used by the positioning algorithm. The concept was verified experimentally in a Wi\nobreakdash-Fi based indoor positioning system, where several regression methods were tested (linear regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks). The highest positioning error estimation accuracy was achieved for random forest regression, with a mean absolute error of 0.72 m.

Title: Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network with Limited Medical Annotations
Authors: Zihan Li, Dandan Shan, Yunxiang Li, Paul E. Kinahan, Qingqi Hong
Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces critical challenges in semi-supervised learning scenarios due to severe annotation scarcity requiring expert radiological knowledge, significant inter-annotator variability across different viewpoints and expertise levels, and inadequate multi-scale feature integration for precise boundary delineation in complex anatomical structures. Existing semi-supervised methods demonstrate substantial performance degradation compared to fully supervised approaches, particularly in small target segmentation and boundary refinement tasks. To address these fundamental challenges, we propose SASNet (Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network), a dual-branch architecture that leverages both low-level and high-level feature representations through novel scale-aware adaptive reweight mechanisms. Our approach introduces three key methodological innovations, including the Scale-aware Adaptive Reweight strategy that dynamically weights pixel-wise predictions using temporal confidence accumulation, the View Variance Enhancement mechanism employing 3D Fourier domain transformations to simulate annotation variability, and segmentation-regression consistency learning through signed distance map algorithms for enhanced boundary precision. These innovations collectively address the core limitations of existing semi-supervised approaches by integrating spatial, temporal, and geometric consistency principles within a unified optimization framework. Comprehensive evaluation across LA, Pancreas-CT, and BraTS datasets demonstrates that SASNet achieves superior performance with limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods while approaching fully supervised performance levels.

Title: An Explainable Agentic AI Framework for Uncertainty-Aware and Abstention-Enabled Acute Ischemic Stroke Imaging Decisions
Authors: Md Rashadul Islam
Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown strong potential in acute ischemic stroke imaging, particularly for lesion detection and segmentation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most existing approaches operate as black box predictors, producing deterministic outputs without explicit uncertainty awareness or structured mechanisms to abstain under ambiguous conditions. This limitation raises serious safety and trust concerns in high risk emergency radiology settings. In this paper, we propose an explainable agentic AI framework for uncertainty aware and abstention enabled decision support in acute ischemic stroke imaging. The framework follows a modular agentic pipeline in which a perception agent performs lesion aware image analysis, an uncertainty estimation agent computes slice level predictive reliability, and a decision agent determines whether to issue a prediction or abstain based on predefined uncertainty thresholds. Unlike prior stroke imaging systems that primarily focus on improving segmentation or classification accuracy, the proposed framework explicitly prioritizes clinical safety, transparency, and clinician aligned decision behavior. Qualitative and case based analyses across representative stroke imaging scenarios demonstrate that uncertainty driven abstention naturally emerges in diagnostically ambiguous regions and low information slices. The framework further integrates visual explanation mechanisms to support both predictive and abstention decisions, addressing a key limitation of existing uncertainty aware medical imaging systems. Rather than introducing a new performance benchmark, this work presents agentic control, uncertainty awareness, and selective abstention as essential design principles for developing safe and trustworthy medical imaging AI systems.

Title: System-Level Comparison of Multimodal and In-Band mmWave Sensing for Beam Prediction in 6G ISAC
Authors: Abidemi Orimogunje, Hyunwoo Park, Igbafe Orikumhi, Sunwoo Kim, Dejan Vukobratovic
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can reduce beam-training overhead in mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links by enabling in-band sensing-based beam prediction, while exteroceptive sensors can further enhance the prediction accuracy. This work develop a system-level framework that evaluates camera, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and in-band mmWave power, both individually and in multimodal fusion using the DeepSense-6G Scenario-33 dataset. A latency-aware neural network composed of lightweight convolutional (CNN) and multilayer-perceptron (MLP) encoders predict a 64-beam index. We assess performance using Top-k accuracy alongside spectral-efficiency (SE) gap, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) gap, rate loss, and end-to-end latency. Results show that the mmWave power vector is a strong standalone predictor, and fusing exteroceptive sensors with it preserves high performance: mmWave alone and mmWave+LiDAR/GPS/Radar achieve 98% Top-5 accuracy, while mmWave+camera achieves 94% Top-5 accuracy. The proposed framework establishes calibrated baselines for 6G ISAC-assisted beam prediction in V2I systems.

Title: Scalable Data-Driven Reachability Analysis and Control via Koopman Operators with Conformal Coverage Guarantees
Authors: Devesh Nath, Haoran Yin, Glen Chou
Abstract: We propose a scalable reachability-based framework for probabilistic, data-driven safety verification of unknown nonlinear dynamics. We use Koopman theory with a neural network (NN) lifting function to learn an approximate linear representation of the dynamics and design linear controllers in this space to enable closed-loop tracking of a reference trajectory distribution. Closed-loop reachable sets are efficiently computed in the lifted space and mapped back to the original state space via NN verification tools. To capture model mismatch between the Koopman dynamics and the true system, we apply conformal prediction to produce statistically-valid error bounds that inflate the reachable sets to ensure the true trajectories are contained with a user-specified probability. These bounds generalize across references, enabling reuse without recomputation. Results on high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks (11D Hopper, 28D Swimmer) and 12D quadcopters show improved reachable set coverage rate, computational efficiency, and conservativeness over existing methods.

Title: Time Series Based CO2 Emission Forecasting and Energy Mix Analysis for Net Zero Transitions: A Multi Country Study
Authors: Salim Oyinlola, Joshua Ajayi, Gozie Ibekwe
Abstract: This study examines long-term CO$_2$ emission trajectories across five major economies: Nigeria, the United States, China, Brazil, and Russia, by integrating national energy-mix characteristics with time-series forecasting models. Annual emissions from 2000-2023 were analyzed alongside energy production data to classify countries into fossil-dependent, transition-phase, or renewable-accelerated profiles. Three forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R$^2$ metrics. Results show that Holt-Winters provided the most accurate forecasts for Nigeria, the United States, China, and Brazil, while SARIMA performed best for Russia due to its relatively stable emissions. Long-term projections from 2024 to 2060 indicate divergent decarbonization pathways. Brazil aligns most closely with a low-emission future owing to its renewable-dominant energy system, whereas Nigeria continues on an upward emissions trajectory driven by fossil dependence. The United States and China maintain moderate declines but require accelerated mitigation to reach their respective net-zero commitments. Russia's emissions remain largely flat under current conditions. These findings highlight the strong influence of energy structures on national decarbonization prospects and underscore the need for targeted energy policy reforms to align with global climate objectives.

Title: Compensating Star-Trackers Misalignments with Adaptive Multi-Model Estimation
Authors: Ridma Ganganath, Simone Servadio, David Daeyoung Lee
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive multi-model framework for jointly estimating spacecraft attitude and star-tracker misalignments in GPS-denied deep-space CubeSat missions. A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) estimates attitude, angular velocity, and gyro bias, while a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) layer operates on a discrete grid of body-to-sensor misalignment hypotheses. In the single-misalignment case, the MEKF processes gyroscope measurements and TRIAD-based attitude observations, and the MMAE updates a three-dimensional grid over the misalignment vector. For a dual-misalignment configuration, the same MEKF dynamics are retained, and the MMAE bank is driven directly by stacked line-of-sight measurements from two star trackers, forming a six-dimensional grid over the two misalignment quaternions without augmenting the continuous-state dimension. A novel diversity metric, $\Psi$, is introduced to trigger adaptive refinement of the misalignment grid around a weighted-mean estimate, thereby preventing premature collapse of the model probabilities and concentrating computation in the most likely region of the parameter space. Monte Carlo simulations show arcsecond-level misalignment estimation and sub-degree attitude errors for both estimation problems, with estimation errors remaining well-bounded, proving robustness and consistency. These results indicate that the proposed MEKF--MMAE architecture enables accurate, autonomous, and computationally efficient in-flight calibration for resource-constrained spacecraft, and establishes dual star-tracker misalignment estimation as a practical option for deep-space CubeSat missions.

Title: YODA: Yet Another One-step Diffusion-based Video Compressor
Authors: Xingchen Li, Junzhe Zhang, Junqi Shi, Ming Lu, Zhan Ma
Abstract: While one-step diffusion models have recently excelled in perceptual image compression, their application to video remains limited. Prior efforts typically rely on pretrained 2D autoencoders that generate per-frame latent representations independently, thereby neglecting temporal dependencies. We present YODA--Yet Another One-step Diffusion-based Video Compressor--which embeds multiscale features from temporal references for both latent generation and latent coding to better exploit spatial-temporal correlations for more compact representation, and employs a linear Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for efficient one-step denoising. YODA achieves state-of-the-art perceptual performance, consistently outperforming traditional and deep-learning baselines on LPIPS, DISTS, FID, and KID. Source code will be publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Towards a Theoretical Framework for Robust Node Deployment in Cooperative ISAC Networks
Authors: Haojin Li, Kaiqian Qu, Chen Sun, Anbang Zhang, Xiaoxue Wang, Wenqi Zhang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: This paper investigates node deployment strategies for robust multi-node cooperative localization in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) this http URL first analyze how steering vector correlation across different positions affects localization performance and introduce a novel distance-weighted correlation metric to characterize this effect. Building upon this insight, we propose a deployment optimization framework that minimizes the maximum weighted steering vector correlation by optimizing simultaneously node positions and array orientations, thereby enhancing worst-case network robustness. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve this min-max optimization, yielding optimized node positions and array orientations. Extensive simulations using both multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and neural-network (NN)-based localization validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating significant improvements in robust localization performance.

Title: Tube-based robust nonlinear model predictive control of anaerobic co-digestion
Authors: Davide Carecci, Laurent Dewasme, Alessio La Bella, Gianni Ferretti, Alain Vande Wouwer
Abstract: To match the growing demand for bio-methane production, anaerobic digesters need to embrace the co-digestion of different feedstocks; in addition, to improve the techno-economic performance, an optimal and time-varying adaptation of the input diet is required. These operation modes constitute a very hard challenge for the limited instrumentation and control equipment typically installed aboard full-scale plants. A model-based predictive approach may be able to handle such control problem, but the identification of reliable predictive models is limited by the low information content typical of the data available from full-scale plants' operations, which entail high parametric uncertainty. In this work, the application of a tube-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed to regulate bio-methane production over a period of diet change in time, while warranting safe operation and dealing with uncertainties. In view of its upcoming validation on a true small pilot-scale plant, the NMPC capabilities are assessed via numerical simulations designed to resemble as much as possible the experimental setup, along with some practical final considerations.

Title: Transient Power Allocation Control Scheme for Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer-Supercapacitor System with Autonomous Inertia Response
Authors: Pengfeng Lin (1), Guangjie Gao (1), Jianjun Ma (1), Miao Zhu (1), Xinan Zhang (2), Ahmed Abu-Siada (3) ((1) Shanghai Jiao Tong University, (2) The University of Western Australia, (3) Curtin University)
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid hydrogen electrolyzer-supercapacitor system (HESS) with a novel control strategy for renewable-dominant power grids. The HESS consists of alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL), and supercapacitors (SC). The interfacing inverters between HESS and power grid are regulated by an inertia emulation control strategy. From HESS, AEL is with conventional DC power control, whereas PEMEL and SC are designed with the proposed dynamic inertia control and capacitive inertia control, respectively. Benefitting from the coordination of three controls, within the HESS, high-frequency transient power components are autonomously handled by SC, stable frequency power components are regulated by PEMEL, and low-frequency steady-state power is addressed by AEL, characterized by low operational gains and longer lifetimes. SC delivers transient power, significantly alleviating energy losses on electrolyzers and achieving adequate inertia recovery capabilities while requiring no additional communication. Implementing SOC recovery control enables the SC to withstand more than three times more stability discharge cycles compared to an SC without SOC recovery. Furthermore, a large-signal mathematical model based on mixed potential theory is established, providing clear stability boundaries for system parameters. Dynamic analyses theoretically verify system feasibility, and extensive hardware-in-the-loop experimental results fully validate the proposed HESS along with the corresponding transient power allocation controls.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Based Whittle Index Policy for Scheduling Wireless Sensors
Authors: Sokipriala Jonah, Seong Ki Yoo, Saurav Sthapit
Abstract: Wireless Sensor nodes used in remote monitoring applications typically transmit data in a timely manner, often optimising for the Age of Information (AoI). However, this approach focuses solely on keeping updates at the sink fresh without considering the actual value of each update. This method is inefficient for sensor networks, which have limited resources. Transmitting data indiscriminately without evaluating its significance not only increases energy consumption but also raises storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheduling strategy that prioritises sensor transmissions based on the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) using an edge mining technique. This ensures that the most valuable updates are received while reducing energy consumption. We frame the scheduling problem as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) and introduce a Whittle Index-based Q-learning (WIQL) policy to dynamically select the most informative sensors. Additionally, we employ an edge mining technique, where raw sensor data is processed locally before transmission, enhancing state estimation at the sink. Experimental results demonstrate that WIQL achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing the number of transmitted packets by up to 70%. This reinforcement learning-based approach provides a scalable and adaptive solution for efficient data scheduling in resource-constrained WSNs.

Title: NeuroSSM: Multiscale Differential State-Space Modeling for Context-Aware fMRI Analysis
Authors: Furkan Genç, Boran İsmet Macun, Sait Sarper Özaslan, Emine U. Saritas, Tolga Çukur
Abstract: Accurate fMRI analysis requires sensitivity to temporal structure across multiple scales, as BOLD signals encode cognitive processes that emerge from fast transient dynamics to slower, large-scale fluctuations. Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes. Experiments on clinical and non-clinical datasets demonstrate that NeuroSSM achieves competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art fMRI analysis methods.

Title: A 2.5 $μ$W 30 nV/$\surd$Hz Instrumentation Amplifier for Bioimpedance Sensors with Source Degenerated Current Mirror and DTMOS Transistor
Authors: Yu Xue, Kwantae Kim
Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power and low-noise instrumentation amplifier (IA) tailored for bioimpedance sensing applications. The design originates from a gain-boosted flipped voltage follower (FVF) transconductance (TC) stage and integrates two complementary circuit techniques to improve the noise performance. To achieve an optimal balance between input-referred noise and available voltage headroom, a source-degenerated current mirror (SDCM) is adopted, resulting in reducing the input-referred noise by 7.95% compared with a conventional current mirror structure. In addition, a dynamic threshold MOSFET (DTMOS) scheme is employed to enhance the effective transconductance, leading to a further 11.66% reduction in input-referred noise. Simulated in a 28 nm CMOS process demonstrate that the proposed IA achieves an input-referred noise floor of 30 nV/$\surd$Hz and a bandwidth of 1.44 MHz, while consuming only 2.5 $\mu$W from a 0.8 V supply. Compared to the baseline design, the proposed approach achieves a 32.4% reduction in power consumption without degrading noise performance. The complete design parameters are open-sourced in this paper, to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future developments.

Title: Multi-Objective Operational Optimization of Energy Storage Systems in User-Side Microgrids
Authors: Jinzhou Xu, Yuanxin Zhuo, Paola Tapia
Abstract: An operational optimization strategy for microgrid energy storage systems (ESSs) is developed to address practical user-oriented application requirements, and its effectiveness is validated using real-world operational data. First, a fundamental ESS model is established to characterize system dynamics and operational constraints, providing a theoretical basis for optimization. Subsequently, a multi-objective operational optimization framework is formulated to simultaneously minimize electricity cost, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance renewable energy utilization. To ensure computational efficiency and scalability, the commercial optimization solver Gurobi is employed. The proposed strategy is evaluated using actual microgrid operational data, demonstrating that the developed ESS model accurately represents real system constraints. Compared with existing user operational strategies, the proposed approach achieves an average reduction of 13.47% in electricity cost. Moreover, by dynamically adjusting the weighting factors of the multi-objective formulation, the strategy enables flexible operational modes and significantly improves adaptability to varying operating scenarios. In addition, the proposed framework provides decision support for user-side microgrids participating in surplus electricity feed-in policies. The main contribution of this work lies in its user-centric optimization design, which enhances operational flexibility and scenario adaptability through multi-objective weight allocation, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world microgrid ESS operation.

Title: Seamlessly Natural: Image Stitching with Natural Appearance Preservation
Authors: Gaetane Lorna N. Tchana, Damaris Belle M. Fotso, Antonio Hendricks, Christophe Bobda
Abstract: This paper introduces SENA (SEamlessly NAtural), a geometry-driven image stitching approach that prioritizes structural fidelity in challenging real-world scenes characterized by parallax and depth variation. Conventional image stitching relies on homographic alignment, but this rigid planar assumption often fails in dual-camera setups with significant scene depth, leading to distortions such as visible warps and spherical bulging. SENA addresses these fundamental limitations through three key contributions. First, we propose a hierarchical affine-based warping strategy, combining global affine initialization with local affine refinement and smooth free-form deformation. This design preserves local shape, parallelism, and aspect ratios, thereby avoiding the hallucinated structural distortions commonly introduced by homography-based models. Second, we introduce a geometry-driven adequate zone detection mechanism that identifies parallax-minimized regions directly from the disparity consistency of RANSAC-filtered feature correspondences, without relying on semantic segmentation. Third, building upon this adequate zone, we perform anchor-based seamline cutting and segmentation, enforcing a one-to-one geometric correspondence across image pairs by construction, which effectively eliminates ghosting, duplication, and smearing artifacts in the final panorama. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets demonstrate that SENA achieves alignment accuracy comparable to leading homography-based methods, while significantly outperforming them in critical visual metrics such as shape preservation, texture integrity, and overall visual realism.

Title: An Energy-Efficient Smart Bus Transport Management System with Blind-Spot Collision Detection Ability
Authors: Md. Sadman Haque, Zobaer Ibn Razzaque, Robiul Awoul Robin, Fahim Hafiz, Riasat Azim
Abstract: Public bus transport systems in developing countries often suffer from a lack of real-time location updates and for users, making commuting inconvenient and unreliable for passengers. Furthermore, stopping at undesired locations rather than designated bus stops creates safety risks and contributes to roadblocks, often causing traffic congestion. Additionally, issues such as blind spots, along with a lack of following traffic laws, increase the chances of accidents. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a smart public bus system along with intelligent bus stops that enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Our approach includes a deep learning-based blind-spot warning system to help drivers avoid accidents with automated bus-stop detection to accurately identify bus stops, improving transit efficiency. We also introduce IoT-based solar-powered smart bus stops that show real-time passenger counts, along with an RFID-based card system to track where passengers board and exit. A smart door system ensures safer and more organised boarding, while real-time bus tracking keeps passengers informed. To connect all these features, we use an HTTP-based server for seamless communication between the interconnected network systems. Our proposed system demonstrated approximately 99% efficiency in real-time blind spot detection while stopping precisely at the bus stops. Furthermore, the server showed real-time location updates both to the users and at the bus stops, enhancing commuting efficiency. The proposed energy-efficient bus stop demonstrated 12.71kWh energy saving, promoting sustainable architecture. Full implementation and source code are available at: this https URL

Title: Pinching Antennas in Blockage-Aware Environments: Modeling, Design, and Optimization
Authors: Ximing Xie, Fang Fang, Zhiguo Ding, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: Pinching-antenna (PA) systems have recently emerged as a promising member of the flexible-antenna family due to their ability to dynamically establish line-of-sight (LoS) links. While most existing studies assume ideal environments without obstacles, practical indoor deployments are often obstacle-rich, where LoS blockage significantly degrades performance. This paper investigates pinching-antenna systems in blockage-aware environments by developing a deterministic model for cylinder-shaped obstacles that precisely characterizes LoS conditions without relying on stochastic approximations. Based on this model, a special case is first studied where each PA serves a single user and can only be deployed at discrete positions along the waveguide. In this case, the waveguide-user assignment is obtained via the Hungarian algorithm, and PA positions are refined using a surrogate-assisted block-coordinate search. Then, a general case is considered where each PA serves all users and can be continuously placed along the waveguide. In this case, beamforming and PA positions are jointly optimized by a weighted minimum mean square error integrated deep deterministic policy gradient (WMMSE-DDPG) approach to address non-smooth LoS transitions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve system throughput and LoS connectivity compared with benchmark methods. Moreover, the results reveal that pinching-antenna systems can effectively leverage obstacles to suppress co-channel interference, converting potential blockages into performance gains.

Title: Simple yet Effective Anti-windup Techniques for Amplitude and Rate Saturation: An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Case Study
Authors: Pouria Sarhadi
Abstract: Actuator amplitude and rate saturation (A\&RSat), together with their consequent windup problem, have long been recognised as challenges in control systems. Anti-windup (AW) solutions have been developed over the past decades, which can generally be categorised into two main groups: classical and modern anti-windup (CAW and MAW) approaches. Classical methods have provided simple and effective results, mainly addressing amplitude saturation. In contrast, modern approaches offer powerful and theoretically sound solutions capable of handling both amplitude and rate saturations. However, MAW's derivation process often imposes restrictive conditions and can be complex to apply in practical engineering problems. Nevertheless, the literature has paid limited attention (if not entirely ignored) to the potential of simple yet effective CAW schemes that can operate in the presence of both A\&RSat elements. This paper revisits this issue and proposes modifications to two well-known controllers: PID and LQI. The obtained results, benchmarked on the REMUS AUV yaw control problem and compared with constrained MPC, indicate that these classical techniques can still provide simple yet effective solutions with comparable performance, at least for SISO systems. These findings may stimulate further research into solutions that achieve comparable performance with only one (or a limited number of) additional tuning parameters and straightforward implementation.

Title: Neural-network-based Self-triggered Observed Platoon Control for Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Zihan Li, Ziming Wang, Chenning Liu, Xin Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates autonomous vehicle (AV) platoon control under uncertain dynamics and intermittent communication, which remains a critical challenge in intelligent transportation systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive consensus tracking control framework for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). The proposed approach integrates backstepping design, a nonlinear sampled-data observer, radial basis function neural networks, and a self-triggered communication mechanism. The radial basis function neural networks approximate unknown nonlinearities and time-varying disturbances, thereby enhancing system robustness. A distributed observer estimates neighboring states based on limited and intermittent measurements, thereby reducing dependence on continuous communication. Moreover, self-triggered mechanism is developed to determine triggering instants, guaranteeing a strictly positive minimum inter-event time and preventing Zeno behavior. The theoretical analysis proves that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and tracking errors converge to a compact set. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high robustness, adaptability, and communication efficiency, making it suitable for real-world networked vehicle systems.

Title: Bayesian Negative Binomial Regression of Afrobeats Chart Persistence
Authors: Ian Jacob Cabansag, Paul Ntegeka
Abstract: Afrobeats songs compete for attention on streaming platforms, where chart visibility can influence both revenue and cultural impact. This paper examines whether collaborations help songs remain on the charts longer, using daily Nigeria Spotify Top 200 data from 2024. Each track is summarized by the number of days it appears in the Top 200 during the year and its total annual streams in Nigeria. A Bayesian negative binomial regression is applied, with days on chart as the outcome and collaboration status (solo versus multi-artist) and log total streams as predictors. This approach is well suited for overdispersed count data and allows the effect of collaboration to be interpreted while controlling for overall popularity. Posterior inference is conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo, and results are assessed using rate ratios, posterior probabilities, and predictive checks. The findings indicate that, after accounting for total streams, collaboration tracks tend to spend slightly fewer days on the chart than comparable solo tracks.

Title: Sampling Strategy Design for Model Predictive Path Integral Control on Legged Robot Locomotion
Authors: Chuyuan Tao, Fanxin Wang, Haolong Jiang, Jia He, Yiyang Chen, Qinglei Bu
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has emerged as a powerful sampling-based optimal control method for complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional systems. However, directly applying MPPI to legged robotic systems presents several challenges. This paper systematically investigates the role of sampling strategy design within the MPPI framework for legged robot locomotion. Based upon the idea of structured control parameterization, we explore and compare multiple sampling strategies within the framework, including both unstructured and spline-based approaches. Through extensive simulations on a quadruped robot platform, we evaluate how different sampling strategies affect control smoothness, task performance, robustness, and sample efficiency. The results provide new insights into the practical implications of sampling design for deploying MPPI on complex legged systems.

Title: Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems
Authors: Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework--Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin--that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CAISO TAC-area dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16, p < 10^{-16}), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest Reserve_{99.5}% margin (14.12%) compared to 16.66% for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.

Title: Context-Aware Information Transfer via Digital Semantic Communication in UAV-Based Networks
Authors: Poorvi Joshi, Mohan Gurusamy (National University of Singapore)
Abstract: In smart cities, bandwidth-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) often fail to relay mission-critical data in time, compromising real-time decision-making. This highlights the need for faster and more efficient transmission of only the most relevant information. To address this, we propose DSC-UAV model, leveraging a context-adaptive Digital Semantic Communication (DSC) framework. This model redefines aerial data transmission through three core components: prompt-aware encoding, dynamic UAV-enabled relaying, and user mobility-optimized reinforcement learning. Ground users transmit context-driven visual content. Images are encoded via Vision Transformer combined with a prompt-text encoder to generate semantic features based on the desired context (generic or object-specific). These features are then quantized and transmitted over a UAV network that dynamically relays the data. Joint trajectory and resource allocation are optimized using Truncated Quantile Critic (TQC)-aided reinforcement learning technique, which offers greater stability and precision over standard SAC and TD3 due to its resistance to overestimation bias. Simulations demonstrate significant performance improvement, up to 22\% gain in semantic-structural similarity and 14\% reduction in Age of Information (AoI) compared to digital and prior UAV-semantic communication baselines. By integrating mobility control with context-driven visual abstraction, DSC-UAV advances resilient, information-centric surveillance for next-generation UAV networks in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Title: Sim2Real SAR Image Restoration: Metadata-Driven Models for Joint Despeckling and Sidelobes Reduction
Authors: Antoine De Paepe, Pascal Nguyen, Michael Mabelle, Cédric Saleun, Antoine Jouadé, Jean-Christophe Louvigne
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides valuable information about the Earth's surface under all weather and illumination conditions. However, the inherent phenomenon of speckle and the presence of sidelobes around bright targets pose challenges for accurate interpretation of SAR imagery. Most existing SAR image restoration methods address despeckling and sidelobes reduction as separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that jointly performs both tasks using neural networks (NNs) trained on a realistic SAR simulated dataset generated with MOCEM. Inference can then be performed on real SAR images, demonstrating effective simulation to real (Sim2Real) transferability. Additionally, we incorporate acquisition metadata as auxiliary input to the NNs, demonstrating improved restoration performance.

Title: KAN-AE with Non-Linearity Score and Symbolic Regression for Energy-Efficient Channel Coding
Authors: Anthony Joseph Perre, Parker Huggins, Alphan Sahin
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) with symbolic regression (SR) for energy-efficient channel coding. By using SR, we convert KAN-AEs into symbolic expressions, which enables low-complexity implementation and improved energy efficiency at the radios. To further enhance the efficiency, we introduce a new non-linearity score term in the SR process to help select lower-complexity equations when possible. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that KAN-AEs achieve competitive BLER performance while improving energy efficiency when paired with SR. We score the energy efficiency of a KAN-AE implementation using the proposed non-linearity metric and compare it to a multi-layer perceptron-based autoencoder (MLP-AE). Our experiment shows that the KAN-AE paired with SR uses 1.38 times less energy than the MLP-AE, supporting that KAN-AEs are a promising choice for energy-efficient deep learning-based channel coding.

Title: Full-Time-Scale Power Management Strategy for Hybrid AC/DC/DS Microgrid with Dynamic Concatenation and Autonomous Frequency / Voltage Restorations
Authors: Qingzuo Meng, Pengfeng Lin, Yujie Wang, Miao Zhu, Amer M. Ghias, Syed Islam, Frede Blaabjerg
Abstract: Hybrid AC/DC microgrids with distributed energy storage (DS) improve power reliability in remote areas. Existing power management methods either focus on steady-state power sharing or transient inertia support, but rarely combine both. They also often ignore frequency and voltage deviations caused by droop control, which can harm sensitive loads. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a full-time-scale (FTS) power management strategy that unifies transient inertia sharing and steady-state power allocation through a novel dynamic concatenator. It also introduces autonomous frequency/voltage restoration to eliminate steady-state deviations in each subgrid. Additionally, a global equivalent circuit model (GECM) is developed to simplify system analysis and design. Experiments confirm that the approach maintains nominal frequency and voltage in steady state while enabling seamless transition between transient inertia support and proportional power sharing across all time scales.

Title: UniCrop: A Universal, Multi-Source Data Engineering Pipeline for Scalable Crop Yield Prediction
Authors: Emiliya Khidirova, Oktay Karakuş
Abstract: Accurate crop yield prediction relies on diverse data streams, including satellite, meteorological, soil, and topographic information. However, despite rapid advances in machine learning, existing approaches remain crop- or region-specific and require data engineering efforts. This limits scalability, reproducibility, and operational deployment. This study introduces UniCrop, a universal and reusable data pipeline designed to automate the acquisition, cleaning, harmonisation, and engineering of multi-source environmental data for crop yield prediction. For any given location, crop type, and temporal window, UniCrop automatically retrieves, harmonises, and engineers over 200 environmental variables (Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, ERA5-Land, NASA POWER, SoilGrids, and SRTM), reducing them to a compact, analysis-ready feature set utilising a structured feature reduction workflow with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). To validate, UniCrop was applied to a rice yield dataset comprising 557 field observations. Using only the selected 15 features, four baseline machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Elastic Net) were trained. LightGBM achieved the best single-model performance (RMSE = 465.1 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6576$), while a constrained ensemble of all baselines further improved accuracy (RMSE = 463.2 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6604$). UniCrop contributes a scalable and transparent data-engineering framework that addresses the primary bottleneck in operational crop yield modelling: the preparation of consistent and harmonised multi-source data. By decoupling data specification from implementation and supporting any crop, region, and time frame through simple configuration updates, UniCrop provides a practical foundation for scalable agricultural analytics. The code and implementation documentation are shared in this https URL.

Title: Cross-Directional Modelling and Control of Slot-Die Battery Electrode Coating
Authors: Hyuntae Kim, Idris Kempf
Abstract: As global battery demand increases, real-time process control becomes increasingly important for battery electrode manufacturing, yet slot-die lines are still mostly manually operated in open loop. This paper develops a physics-based modelling-and-control pipeline for film-thickness regulation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations provide the data from which a low-order cross-directional model is identified and calibrated. Numerical simulations demonstrate close agreement between the CFD and the cross-directional model, which is used to design a controller that can be used in both real-time, automated feedback operation and manual feedforward operation during line commissioning.

Title: Host-Aware Control of Gene Expression using Data-Enabled Predictive Control
Authors: Liam Perreault, Idris Kempf, Kirill Sechkar, Jean-Baptiste Lugagne, Antonis Papachristodoulou
Abstract: Cybergenetic gene expression control in bacteria enables applications in engineering biology, drug development, and biomanufacturing. AI-based controllers offer new possibilities for real-time, single-cell-level regulation but typically require large datasets and re-training for new systems. Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) offers better sample efficiency without prior modelling. We apply DeePC to a system with two inputs, optogenetic control and media concentration, and two outputs, expression of gene of interest and host growth rate. Using basis functions to address nonlinearities, we demonstrate that DeePC remains robust to parameter variations and performs among the best control strategies while using the least data.

Title: Robust Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Video Transmission over Multipath Fading Channel
Authors: Bohuai Xiao, Jian Zou, Fanyang Meng, Wei Liu, Yongsheng Liang
Abstract: To address the challenges of wireless video transmission over multipath fading channels, we propose a robust deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) framework by effectively exploiting temporal redundancy and incorporating robust innovations at the modulation, coding, and decoding stages. At the modulation stage, tailored orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for robust video transmission is employed, decomposing wideband signals into orthogonal frequency-flat sub-channels to effectively mitigate frequency-selective fading. At the coding stage, conditional contextual coding with multi-scale Gaussian warped features is introduced to efficiently model temporal redundancy, significantly improving reconstruction quality under strict bandwidth constraints. At the decoding stage, a lightweight denoising module is integrated to robustly simplify signal restoration and accelerate convergence, addressing the suboptimality and slow convergence typically associated with simultaneously performing channel estimation, equalization, and semantic reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robust framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video DeepJSCC methods, achieving an average reconstruction quality gain of 5.13 dB under challenging multipath fading channel conditions.

Title: Joint Sparsity and Beamforming Design for RDARS-Aided Systems
Authors: Chengwang Ji, Haiquan Lu, Qiaoyan Peng, Jintao Wang, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antennas and reflecting surface (RDARS) has emerged as a promising architecture for communication and sensing performance enhancement. In particular, the new selection gain can be achieved by leveraging the dynamic working mode selection between connection and reflection modes, whereas low-complexity element configuration remains an open issue. In this paper, we consider a RDARS-assisted communication system, where the connected elements are formed as a uniform sparse array for simplified mode configuration while achieving enlarged physical array aperture. The sum rate maximization problem is then formulated by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming matrices and sparsity of connected element array. For the special cases of a single user equipment (UE) and two UEs, the optimal sparsity designs are derived in closed-form. Then, for an arbitrary number of UEs, a weighted minimum mean-square error-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of optimizing the sparsity and the effectiveness of low-complexity sparsity optimization.

Title: Rethinking Secure Semantic Communications in the Age of Generative and Agentic AI: Threats and Opportunities
Authors: Shunpu Tang, Yuanyuan Jia, Zijiu Yang, Qianqian Yang, Ruichen Zhang, Jun Du, Jihong Park, Zhiguo Shi, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.

Title: On the Performance of Lossless Reciprocal MiLAC Architectures in Multi-User Networks
Authors: Tianyu Fang, Xiaohua Zhou, Yijie Mao
Abstract: Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC)-aided beamforming, which processes the transmitted symbols fully in the analog domain, has recently emerged as a promising alternative to fully digital and hybrid beamforming architectures for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While prior studies have shown that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC can achieve the same capacity as digital beamforming in a single-user MIMO network, its performance in multi-user scenarios remains unknown. To answer this question, in this work, we establish a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) network with a MiLAC-aided transmitter, and investigate its sum-rate performance. Based on the microwave network theory, we first prove that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC cannot achieve the same performance as digital beamforming in a general MU-MISO network. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem and develop an efficient optimization framework to jointly optimize the power allocation and the scattering matrix for MiLAC. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MiLAC is a promising architecture for future extremely large-scale MIMO systems.

Title: MORE: Multi-Objective Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition
Authors: Xiaoxue Gao, Zexin Li, Yiming Chen, Nancy F. Chen
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper has greatly expanded their adoption across diverse real-world applications. Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack.

Title: Policy Optimization with Differentiable MPC: Convergence Analysis under Uncertainty
Authors: Riccardo Zuliani, Efe C. Balta, John Lygeros
Abstract: Model-based policy optimization is a well-established framework for designing reliable and high-performance controllers across a wide range of control applications. Recently, this approach has been extended to model predictive control policies, where explicit dynamical models are embedded within the control law. However, the performance of the resulting controllers, and the convergence of the associated optimization algorithms, critically depends on the accuracy of the models. In this paper, we demonstrate that combining gradient-based policy optimization with recursive system identification ensures convergence to an optimal controller design and showcase our finding in several control examples.

Title: Doppler-Resilient LEO Satellite OFDM Transmission with Affine Frequency Domain Pilot
Authors: Tang Shuntian, Wu Xiaomei, Wang Xinyi, Zhao Le, Yang Guang, Liu Zilong, Liu Fan, Fei Zesong
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system suffers from severe Doppler shifts, while {the Doppler-resilient affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) transmission suffers from significantly high processing complexity in data detection}. In this paper, we explore the channel estimation gain of affine frequency (AF) domain pilot to enhance the OFDM transmission under high mobility. Specifically, we propose a novel AF domain pilot embedding scheme for satellite-ground downlink OFDM systems for capturing the channel characteristics. By exploiting the autoregressive (AR) property of adjacent channels, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based predictor is designed to replace conventional interpolation operation in OFDM channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme significantly outperforms conventional OFDM scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER) under high Doppler scenarios, thus paving a new way for the design of next generation non-terrestrial network (NTN) communication systems.

Title: Towards Prosodically Informed Mizo TTS without Explicit Tone Markings
Authors: Abhijit Mohanta, Remruatpuii, Priyankoo Sarmah, Rohit Sinha, Wendy Lalhminghlui
Abstract: This paper reports on the development of a text-to-speech (TTS) system for Mizo, a low-resource, tonal, and Tibeto-Burman language spoken primarily in the Indian state of Mizoram. The TTS was built with only 5.18 hours of data; however, in terms of subjective and objective evaluations, the outputs were considered perceptually acceptable and intelligible. A baseline model using Tacotron2 was built, and then, with the same data, another TTS model was built with VITS. In both subjective and objective evaluations, the VITS model outperformed the Tacotron2 model. In terms of tone synthesis, the VITS model showed significantly lower tone errors than the Tacotron2 model. The paper demonstrates that a non-autoregressive, end-to-end framework can achieve synthesis of acceptable perceptual quality and intelligibility.

Title: Finite-State Decentralized Policy-Based Control With Guaranteed Ground Coverage
Authors: Hossein Rastgoftar
Abstract: We propose a finite-state, decentralized decision and control framework for multi-agent ground coverage. The approach decomposes the problem into two coupled components: (i) the structural design of a deep neural network (DNN) induced by the reference configuration of the agents, and (ii) policy-based decentralized coverage control. Agents are classified as anchors and followers, yielding a generic and scalable communication architecture in which each follower interacts with exactly three in-neighbors from the preceding layer, forming an enclosing triangular communication structure. The DNN training weights implicitly encode the spatial configuration of the agent team, thereby providing a geometric representation of the environmental target set. Within this architecture, we formulate a computationally efficient decentralized Markov decision process (MDP) whose components are time-invariant except for a time-varying cost function defined by the deviation from the centroid of the target set contained within each agent communication triangle. By introducing the concept of Anyway Output Controllability (AOC), we assume each agent is AOC and establish decentralized convergence to a desired configuration that optimally represents the environmental target.

Title: Beam-Brainstorm: A Generative Site-Specific Beamforming Approach
Authors: Zihao Zhou, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Accurately understanding the propagation environment is a fundamental challenge in site-specific beamforming (SSBF). This paper proposes a novel generative SSBF (GenSSBF) solution, which represents a paradigm shift from conventional unstructured prediction to joint-structure modeling. First, considering the fundamental differences between beam generation and conventional image synthesis, a unified GenSSBF framework is proposed, which includes a site profile, a wireless prompting module, and a generator. Second, a beam-brainstorm (BBS) solution is proposed as an instantiation of this GenSSBF framework. Specifically, the site profile is configured by transforming channel data from spatial domain to a reversible latent space via discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To facilitate practical deployment, the wireless prompt is constructed from the reference signal received power (RSRP) measured using a small number of DFT-beams. Finally, the generator is developed using a customized conditional diffusion model. Rather than relying on a meticulously designed global codebook, BBS directly generates diverse and high-fidelity user-specific beams guided by the wireless prompts. Simulation results on accurate ray-tracing datasets demonstrate that BBS can achieve near-optimal beamforming gain while drastically reducing the beam sweeping overhead, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments.

Title: Backscatter-Assisted High-Speed Rail Communications in Straight Tunnel Environments: Effects of Tag Number and Phase Control
Authors: Yunping Mu, Gongpu Wang, Ruisi He, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis, Saman Atapattu, Chintha Tellambura
Abstract: Backscatter communication is a promising technology to enhance the signal strength received by the receiver in straight tunnel environments. The impact of the number of tags and their phase adjustment on system performance remains a challenging issue though. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the channel gain of backscatter-assisted communication with multiple tags in straight tunnels. In particular, we derive the probabilities that the backscatter link gain is greater than the direct link under adjustable and random phase assumptions by applying the Gaussian and Gamma approximations to derive tractable expressions. The simulation results show that phaseadjustable tags significantly improve the channel gain of the backscatter links compared to the random phase case. Moreover, the number of tags has an upper threshold for an effective tag deployment pattern. These insights provide valuable guidelines for the efficient design of backscatter communication systems in tunnel environments.

Title: Ultra-low-power Monostatic Backscatter Platform with Phase-Aware Channel Estimation and System-Level Validation
Authors: Hanyeol Ryu, Sangkil Kim
Abstract: This paper presents a novel channel-estimation (CE) method that mitigates residual phase drifts in backscatter links and a full hardware and signal-processing pipeline for a single-antenna monostatic system. The platform comprises a semi-passive tag, a software-defined radio (SDR) reader, and a 2x1 planar Yagi-Uda array (7 dBi with higher than 30 dB isolation) operating at 2.4 ~ 2.5 GHz. The developed backscatter fading model accounts for round-trip propagation and temporal correlation, and employs an analytically derived resource-optimal pilot allocation strategy. At the receiver, optimized least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) CE with pilot-aided carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation feed a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer to suppress ISI. The prototype delivers 500 kbps at 1 m with power of 158 uW (SDR baseband) and 10 uW (RF switch), yielding 320 pJ/bit. OOK and BPSK modulations achieve measured EVMs of 2.97 % and 4.02 %, respectively. Performance is validated by BER measurements and successful reconstruction of a full-color image in an over-the-air experiment. The results demonstrate an ultra-low-power, multimedia-capable backscatter IoT link and provide practical hardware-software co-design guidance for scalable deployments.

Title: On the Role of Spatial Features in Foundation-Model-Based Speaker Diarization
Authors: Marc Deegen, Tobias Gburrek, Tobias Cord-Landwehr, Thilo von Neumann, Jiangyu Han, Lukáš Burget, Reinhold Haeb-Umbach
Abstract: Recent advances in speaker diarization exploit large pretrained foundation models, such as WavLM, to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Systems like DiariZen leverage these rich single-channel representations, but are limited to single-channel audio, preventing the use of spatial cues available in multi-channel recordings. This work analyzes the impact of incorporating spatial information into a state-of-the-art single-channel diarization system by evaluating several strategies for conditioning the model on multi-channel spatial features. Experiments on meeting-style datasets indicate that spatial information can improve diarization performance, but the overall improvement is smaller than expected for the proposed system, suggesting that the features aggregated over all WavLM layers already capture much of the information needed for accurate speaker discrimination, also in overlapping speech regions. These findings provide insight into the potential and limitations of using spatial cues to enhance foundation model-based diarization.

Title: Optimal Dispatch of Electricity and Water in Renewable-Integrated Desalination Plants
Authors: Ahmed S. Alahmed, Audun Botterud, Saurabh Amin, Ali T. Al-Awami
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal dispatch of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the dispatch decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.

Title: Characterizing All Locally Exponentially Stabilizing Controllers as a Linear Feedback Plus Learnable Nonlinear Youla Dynamics
Authors: Luca Furieri
Abstract: We derive a state-space characterization of all dynamic state-feedback controllers that make an equilibrium of a nonlinear input-affine continuous-time system locally exponentially stable. Specirically, any controller obtained as the sum of a linear state-feedback $u=Kx$, with $K$ stabilizing the linearized system, and the output of internal locally exponentially stable controller dynamics is itself locally exponentially stabilizing. Conversely, every dynamic state-feedback controller that locally exponentially stabilizes the equilibrium admits such a decomposition. The result can be viewed as a state-space nonlinear Youla-type parametrization specialized to local, rather than global, and exponential, rather than asymptotic, closed-loop stability. The residual locally exponentially stable controller dynamics can be implemented with stable recurrent neural networks and trained as neural ODEs to achieve high closed-loop performance in nonlinear control tasks.

Title: Machine Learning Guided Cooling Optimization for Data Centers
Authors: Shrenik Jadhav, Zheng Liu
Abstract: Effective data center cooling is crucial for reliable operation; however, cooling systems often exhibit inefficiencies that result in excessive energy consumption. This paper presents a three-stage, physics-guided machine learning framework for identifying and reducing cooling energy waste in high-performance computing facilities. Using one year of 10-minute resolution operational data from the Frontier exascale supercomputer, we first train a monotonicity-constrained gradient boosting surrogate that predicts facility accessory power from coolant flow rates, temperatures, and server power. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.026 MW and predicts power usage effectiveness within 0.01 of measured values for 98.7% of test samples. In the second stage, the surrogate serves as a physics-consistent baseline to quantify excess cooling energy, revealing approximately 85 MWh of annual inefficiency concentrated in specific months, hours, and operating regimes. The third stage evaluates guardrail-constrained counterfactual adjustments to supply temperature and subloop flows, demonstrating that up to 96% of identified excess can be recovered through small, safe setpoint changes while respecting thermal limits and operational constraints. The framework yields interpretable recommendations, supports counterfactual analyses such as flow reduction during low-load periods and redistribution of thermal duty across cooling loops, and provides a practical pathway toward quantifiable reductions in accessory power. The developed framework is readily compatible with model predictive control and can be extended to other liquid-cooled data centers with different configurations and cooling requirements.

Title: Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Three-phase Asynchronous Motor Under Variable Working Conditions
Authors: Shijin Chen, Zeyi Liu, Chenyang Li, Dongliang Zou, Xiao He, Donghua Zhou
Abstract: Three-phase asynchronous motor are fundamental components in industrial systems, and their failure can lead to significant operational downtime and economic losses. Vibration and current signals are effective indicators for monitoring motor health and diagnosing faults. However, motors in real applications often operate under variable conditions such as fluctuating speeds and loads, which complicate the fault diagnosis process. This paper presents a comprehensive dataset collected from a three-phase asynchronous motor under various fault types and severities, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. The dataset includes both single faults and mechanical-electrical compound faults, such as rotor unbalance, stator winding short circuits, bearing faults, and their combinations. Data were acquired under both steady and transitional conditions, with signals including triaxial vibration, three-phase currents, torque, and key-phase signals. This dataset supports the development and validation of robust fault diagnosis methods for electric motors under realistic operating conditions.

Title: Energy-Aware Routing to Large Reasoning Models
Authors: Austin R. Ellis-Mohr, Max Hartman, Lav R. Varshney
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have heterogeneous inference energy costs based on which model is used and how much it reasons. To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.

Title: Index-ASR Technical Report
Authors: Zheshu Song, Lu Wang, Wei Deng, Zhuo Yang, Yong Wu, Bin Xia
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, largely driven by the emergence of LLM-based ASR paradigm. Despite their strong performance on a variety of open-source benchmarks, existing LLM-based ASR systems still suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are prone to hallucination errors, often generating excessively long and repetitive outputs that are not well grounded in the acoustic input. Second, they provide limited support for flexible and fine-grained contextual customization. To address these challenges, we propose Index-ASR, a large-scale LLM-based ASR system designed to simultaneously enhance robustness and support customizable hotword recognition. The core idea of Index-ASR lies in the integration of LLM and large-scale training data enriched with background noise and contextual information. Experimental results show that our Index-ASR achieves strong performance on both open-source benchmarks and in-house test sets, highlighting its robustness and practicality for real-world ASR applications.

Title: Simulations of MRI Guided and Powered Ferric Applicators for Tetherless Delivery of Therapeutic Interventions
Authors: Wenhui Chu, Khang Tran, Nikolaos V. Tsekos
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established modality for pre-operative planning and is also explored for intra-operative guidance of procedures such as intravascular interventions. Among the experimental robot-assisted technologies, the magnetic field gradients of the MRI scanner are used to power and maneuver ferromagnetic applicators for accessing sites in the patient's body via the vascular network. In this work, we propose a computational platform for preoperative planning and modeling of MRI-powered applicators inside blood vessels. This platform was implemented as a two-way data and command pipeline that links the MRI scanner, the computational core, and the operator. The platform first processes multi-slice MR data to extract the vascular bed and then fits a virtual corridor inside the vessel. This corridor serves as a virtual fixture (VF), a forbidden region for the applicators to avoid vessel perforation or collision. The geometric features of the vessel centerline, the VF, and MRI safety compliance (dB/dt, max available gradient) are then used to generate magnetic field gradient waveforms. Different blood flow profiles can be user-selected, and those parameters are used for modeling the applicator's maneuvering. The modeling module further generates cues about whether the selected vascular path can be safely maneuvered. Given future experimental studies that require a real-time operation, the platform was implemented on the Qt framework (C/C++) with software modules performing specific tasks running on dedicated threads: PID controller, generation of VF, generation of MR gradient waveforms.

Title: Improving Variational Autoencoder using Random Fourier Transformation: An Aviation Safety Anomaly Detection Case-Study
Authors: Ata Akbari Asanjan, Milad Memarzadeh, Bryan Matthews, Nikunj Oza
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.

Title: Spatially-Coupled Network RNA Velocities: A Control-Theoretic Perspective
Authors: Boya Hou, Maxim Raginsky, Abhishek Pandey, Olgica Milenkovic
Abstract: RNA velocity is an important model that combines cellular spliced and unspliced RNA counts to infer dynamical properties of various regulatory functions. Despite its wide applicability and many variants used in practice, the model has not been adequately designed to directly account for both intracellular gene regulatory network interactions and spatial intercellular communications. Here, we propose a new RNA velocity approach that jointly and directly captures two new network structures: an intracellular gene regulatory network (GRN) and an intercellular interaction network that captures interactions between (neighboring) cells, with relevance to spatial transcriptomics. We theoretically analyze this two-level network system through the lens of control and consensus theory. In particular, we investigate network equilibria, stability, cellular network consensus, and optimal control approaches for targeted drug intervention.

Title: Wireless Dataset Similarity: Measuring Distances in Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning
Authors: João Morais, Sadjad Alikhani, Akshay Malhotra, Shahab Hamidi-Rad, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: This paper introduces a task- and model-aware framework for measuring similarity between wireless datasets, enabling applications such as dataset selection/augmentation, simulation-to-real (sim2real) comparison, task-specific synthetic data generation, and informing decisions on model training/adaptation to new deployments. We evaluate candidate dataset distance metrics by how well they predict cross-dataset transferability: if two datasets have a small distance, a model trained on one should perform well on the other. We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks. For this task, we derive a label-aware distance by integrating supervised UMAP and penalties for dataset imbalance. Across both tasks, the resulting distances outperform traditional baselines and consistently exhibit stronger correlations with model transferability, supporting task-relevant comparisons between wireless datasets.

Title: Efficient Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformers
Authors: Jianan Li, Wangcai Zhao, Tingfa Xu
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is essential across various disciplines for its capacity to capture rich spectral information. However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

Title: Tiny Machine Learning for Real-Time Aquaculture Monitoring: A Case Study in Morocco
Authors: Achraf Hsain, Yahya Zaki, Othman Abaakil, Hibat-allah Bekkar, Yousra Chtouki
Abstract: Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms, is a rapidly growing industry facing challenges such as water quality fluctuations, disease outbreaks, and inefficient feed management. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual labor and are time consuming, leading to potential delays in addressing issues. This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations. By demonstrating the potential benefits of TinyML in aquaculture, our aim is to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient farming practices.

Title: A UAV-Based Multispectral and RGB Dataset for Multi-Stage Paddy Crop Monitoring in Indian Agricultural Fields
Authors: Adari Rama Sukanya, Puvvula Roopesh Naga Sri Sai, Kota Moses, Rimalapudi Sarvendranath
Abstract: We present a large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based RGB and multispectral image dataset collected over paddy fields in the Vijayawada region, Andhra Pradesh, India, covering nursery to harvesting stages. We used a 20-megapixel RGB camera and a 5-megapixel four-band multispectral camera capturing red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared bands. Standardised operating procedure (SOP) and checklists were developed to ensure repeatable data acquisition. Our dataset comprises of 42,430 raw images (415 GB) captured over 5 acres with 1 cm/pixel ground sampling distance (GSD) with associated metadata such as GPS coordinates, flight altitude, and environmental conditions. Captured images were validated using Pix4D Fields to generate orthomosaic maps and vegetation index maps, such as normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalised difference red-edge (NDRE) index. Our dataset is one of the few datasets that provide high-resolution images with rich metadata that cover all growth stages of Indian paddy crops. The dataset is available on IEEE DataPort with DOI, . It can support studies on targeted spraying, disease analysis, and yield estimation.

Title: Histogram Assisted Quality Aware Generative Model for Resolution Invariant NIR Image Colorization
Authors: Abhinav Attri, Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi, Samiran Das, Vinod Kumar Kurmi
Abstract: We present HAQAGen, a unified generative model for resolution-invariant NIR-to-RGB colorization that balances chromatic realism with structural fidelity. The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods. HAQAGen produces images with sharper textures, natural colors, attaining significant gains as per perceptual metrics. These results position HAQAGen as a scalable and effective solution for NIR-to-RGB translation across diverse imaging scenarios. Project Page: this https URL

Title: On the Structure of the Optimal Detector for Sub-THz Multi-Hop Relays with Unknown Prior: Over-the-Air Diffusion
Authors: Ozgur Ercetin, Mohaned Chraiti
Abstract: Amplify and forward (AF) relaying is a viable strategy to extend the coverage of sub-terahertz (sub-THz) links, but inevitably propagates noise, leading to cumulative degradation across multiple hops. At the receiver, optimal decoding is desirable, yet challenging under non-Gaussian input distributions (video, voice, etc), for which neither the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator nor the mutual information admits a closed form. A further open question is whether knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) and noise statistics at the intermediate relays is necessary for optimal detection. Aiming for an optimal decoder, this paper introduces a new framework that interprets the AF relay chain as a variance-preserving diffusion process and employs denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) for signal recovery. We show that each AF hop is mathematically equivalent to a diffusion step with hop-dependent attenuation and noise injection. Consequently, the entire multi-hop chain collapses to an equivalent Gaussian channel fully described by only three real scalars per block: the cumulative complex gain and the effective noise variance. At the receiver, these end-to-end sufficient statistics define a matched reverse schedule that guides the DDIM-based denoiser, enabling near-optimal Bayesian decoding without per-hop CSI. We establish the information-theoretic foundation of this equivalence, proving that decoding performance depends solely on the final effective Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), regardless of intermediate noise/channel allocation or prior distribution. Simulations under AWGN and Rician fading confirm that the proposed AF-DDIM decoder reduces mean-squared error, symbol error rate, and bit error rate, particularly at moderate SNRs and for higher-order constellations.

Title: MS-ISSM: Objective Quality Assessment of Point Clouds Using Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity
Authors: Zhang Chen, Shuai Wan, Yuezhe Zhang, Siyu Ren, Fuzheng Yang, Junhui Hou
Abstract: The unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds poses a significant challenge for objective quality assessment (PCQA), particularly in establishing accurate perceptual feature correspondence. To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization. The source code is available at: this https URL.

Title: IO-RAE: Information-Obfuscation Reversible Adversarial Example for Audio Privacy Protection
Authors: Jiajie Zhu, Xia Du, Xiaoyuan Liu, Jizhe Zhou, Qizhen Xu, Zheng Lin, Chi-Man Pun
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly accelerated the adoption of speech recognition technology, leading to its widespread integration across various applications. However, this surge in usage also highlights a critical issue: audio data is highly vulnerable to unauthorized exposure and analysis, posing significant privacy risks for businesses and individuals. This paper introduces an Information-Obfuscation Reversible Adversarial Example (IO-RAE) framework, the pioneering method designed to safeguard audio privacy using reversible adversarial examples. IO-RAE leverages large language models to generate misleading yet contextually coherent content, effectively preventing unauthorized eavesdropping by humans and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Additionally, we propose the Cumulative Signal Attack technique, which mitigates high-frequency noise and enhances attack efficacy by targeting low-frequency signals. Our approach ensures the protection of audio data without degrading its quality or our ability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a targeted misguidance rate of 96.5% and a remarkable 100% untargeted misguidance rate in obfuscating target keywords across multiple ASR models, including a commercial black-box system from Google. Furthermore, the quality of the recovered audio, measured by the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality score, reached 4.45, comparable to high-quality original recordings. Notably, the recovered audio processed by ASR systems exhibited an error rate of 0%, indicating nearly lossless recovery. These results highlight the practical applicability and effectiveness of our IO-RAE framework in protecting sensitive audio privacy.

Title: Diffusion Timbre Transfer Via Mutual Information Guided Inpainting
Authors: Ching Ho Lee, Javier Nistal, Stefan Lattner, Marco Pasini, George Fazekas
Abstract: We study timbre transfer as an inference-time editing problem for music audio. Starting from a strong pre-trained latent diffusion model, we introduce a lightweight procedure that requires no additional training: (i) a dimension-wise noise injection that targets latent channels most informative of instrument identity, and (ii) an early-step clamping mechanism that re-imposes the input's melodic and rhythmic structure during reverse diffusion. The method operates directly on audio latents and is compatible with text/audio conditioning (e.g., CLAP). We discuss design choices,analyze trade-offs between timbral change and structural preservation, and show that simple inference-time controls can meaningfully steer pre-trained models for style-transfer use cases.

Title: LinMU: Multimodal Understanding Made Linear
Authors: Hongjie Wang, Niraj K. Jha
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.

Title: UltraEval-Audio: A Unified Framework for Comprehensive Evaluation of Audio Foundation Models
Authors: Qundong Shi, Jie Zhou, Biyuan Lin, Junbo Cui, Guoyang Zeng, Yixuan Zhou, Ziyang Wang, Xin Liu, Zhen Luo, Yudong Wang, Zhiyuan Liu
Abstract: The development of audio foundation models has accelerated rapidly since the emergence of GPT-4o. However, the lack of comprehensive evaluation has become a critical bottleneck for further progress in the field, particularly in audio generation. Current audio evaluation faces three major challenges: (1) audio evaluation lacks a unified framework, with datasets and code scattered across various sources, hindering fair and efficient cross-model comparison;(2) audio codecs, as a key component of audio foundation models, lack a widely accepted and holistic evaluation methodology; (3) existing speech benchmarks are heavily reliant on English, making it challenging to objectively assess models' performance on Chinese. To address the first issue, we introduce UltraEval-Audio, a unified evaluation framework for audio foundation models, specifically designed for both audio understanding and generation tasks. UltraEval-Audio features a modular architecture, supporting 10 languages and 14 core task categories, while seamlessly integrating 24 mainstream models and 36 authoritative benchmarks. To enhance research efficiency, the framework provides a one-command evaluation feature, accompanied by real-time public leaderboards. For the second challenge, UltraEval-Audio adopts a novel comprehensive evaluation scheme for audio codecs, evaluating performance across three key dimensions: semantic accuracy, timbre fidelity, and acoustic quality. To address the third issue, we propose two new Chinese benchmarks, SpeechCMMLU and SpeechHSK, designed to assess Chinese knowledge proficiency and language fluency. We wish that UltraEval-Audio will provide both academia and industry with a transparent, efficient, and fair platform for comparison of audio models. Our code, benchmarks, and leaderboards are available at this https URL.

Title: SAFE-QAQ: End-to-End Slow-Thinking Audio-Text Fraud Detection via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Peidong Wang, Zhiming Ma, Xin Dai, Yongkang Liu, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Wenxing Hu, Zhihao Wang, Mingjun Pan, Li Yuan, Daling Wang
Abstract: Existing fraud detection methods predominantly rely on transcribed text, suffering from ASR errors and missing crucial acoustic cues like vocal tone and environmental context. This limits their effectiveness against complex deceptive strategies. To address these challenges, we first propose \textbf{SAFE-QAQ}, an end-to-end comprehensive framework for audio-based slow-thinking fraud detection. First, the SAFE-QAQ framework eliminates the impact of transcription errors on detection performance. Secondly, we propose rule-based slow-thinking reward mechanisms that systematically guide the system to identify fraud-indicative patterns by accurately capturing fine-grained audio details, through hierarchical reasoning processes. Besides, our framework introduces a dynamic risk assessment framework during live calls, enabling early detection and prevention of fraud. Experiments on the TeleAntiFraud-Bench demonstrate that SAFE-QAQ achieves dramatic improvements over existing methods in multiple key dimensions, including accuracy, inference efficiency, and real-time processing capabilities. Currently deployed and analyzing over 70,000 calls daily, SAFE-QAQ effectively automates complex fraud detection, reducing human workload and financial losses. Code: this https URL.

Title: OV-InstructTTS: Towards Open-Vocabulary Instruct Text-to-Speech
Authors: Yong Ren, Jiangyan Yi, Jianhua Tao, Haiyang Sun, Zhengqi Wen, Hao Gu, Le Xu, Ye Bai
Abstract: Instruct Text-to-Speech (InstructTTS) leverages natural language descriptions as style prompts to guide speech synthesis. However, existing InstructTTS methods mainly rely on a direct combination of audio-related labels or their diverse rephrasings, making it difficult to handle flexible, high-level instructions. Such rigid control is insufficient for users such as content creators who wish to steer generation with descriptive instructions. To address these constraints, we introduce OV-InstructTTS, a new paradigm for open-vocabulary InstructTTS. We propose a comprehensive solution comprising a newly curated dataset, OV-Speech, and a novel reasoning-driven framework. The OV-Speech dataset pairs speech with open-vocabulary instructions, each augmented with a reasoning process that connects high-level instructions to acoustic features. The reasoning-driven framework infers emotional, acoustic, and paralinguistic information from open-vocabulary instructions before synthesizing speech. Evaluations show that this reasoning-driven approach significantly improves instruction-following fidelity and speech expressiveness. We believe this work can inspire the next user-friendly InstructTTS systems with stronger generalization and real-world applicability. The dataset and demos are publicly available on our project page.

Title: Bridging the gap: A comparative exploration of Speech-LLM and end-to-end architecture for multilingual conversational ASR
Authors: Yuxiang Mei, Dongxing Xu, Jiaen Liang, Yanhua Long
Abstract: The INTERSPEECH 2025 Challenge on Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Models (MLC-SLM) promotes multilingual conversational ASR with large language models (LLMs). Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Lyapunov Functions can Exactly Quantify Rate Performance of Nonlinear Differential Equations
Authors: Declan S. Jagt, Matthew M. Peet
Abstract: Pointwise-in-time stability notions for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provide quantitative metrics for system performance by establishing bounds on the rate of decay of the system state in terms of initial condition -- allowing stability to be quantified by e.g. the maximum provable decay rate. Such bounds may be obtained by finding suitable Lyapunov functions using, e.g. Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization. While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance. In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate. Finally, we show how the proposed conditions can be enforced using SOS programming in the case of exponential, rational, and finite-time stability. Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance.

Title: MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization
Authors: Donghua Yu, Zhengyuan Lin, Chen Yang, Yiyang Zhang, Zhaoye Fei, Hanfu Chen, Jingqi Chen, Ke Chen, Qinyuan Cheng, Liwei Fan, Yi Jiang, Jie Zhu, Muchen Li, Shimin Li, Wenxuan Wang, Yang Wang, Zhe Xu, Yitian Gong, Yuqian Zhang
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.

Title: MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning
Authors: Chunyu Qiang, Jun Wang, Xiaopeng Wang, Kang Yin, Yuxin Guo, Xijuan Zeng, Nan Li, Zihan Li, Yuzhe Liang, Ziyu Zhang, Teng Ma, Yushen Chen, Zhongliang Liu, Feng Deng, Chen Zhang, Pengfei Wan
Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.

Title: CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty
Authors: Rishav Sen, Fangqi Liu, Jose Paolo Talusan, Ava Pettet, Yoshinori Suzue, Mark Bailey, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.

Title: Real Time NILM Based Power Monitoring of Identical Induction Motors Representing Cutting Machines in Textile Industry
Authors: Md Istiauk Hossain Rifat, Moin Khan, Mohammad Zunaed
Abstract: The textile industry in Bangladesh is one of the most energy-intensive sectors, yet its monitoring practices remain largely outdated, resulting in inefficient power usage and high operational costs. To address this, we propose a real-time Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)-based framework tailored for industrial applications, with a focus on identical motor-driven loads representing textile cutting machines. A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms. A new dataset was created from three identical induction motors and auxiliary loads, totaling over 180,000 samples, to evaluate the state-of-the-art MATNILM model under challenging industrial conditions. Results indicate that while aggregate energy estimation was reasonably accurate, per-appliance disaggregation faced difficulties, particularly when multiple identical machines operated simultaneously. Despite these challenges, the integrated system demonstrated practical real-time monitoring with remote accessibility through the Blynk application. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of NILM in industrial contexts, offering insights into future improvements such as higher-frequency data collection, larger-scale datasets and advanced deep learning approaches for handling identical loads.

Title: Simulations and Advancements in MRI-Guided Power-Driven Ferric Tools for Wireless Therapeutic Interventions
Authors: Wenhui Chu, Aobo Jin, Hardik A. Gohel
Abstract: Designing a robotic system that functions effectively within the specific environment of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner requires solving numerous technical issues, such as maintaining the robot's precision and stability under strong magnetic fields. This research focuses on enhancing MRI's role in medical imaging, especially in its application to guide intravascular interventions using robot-assisted devices. A newly developed computational system is introduced, designed for seamless integration with the MRI scanner, including a computational unit and user interface. This system processes MR images to delineate the vascular network, establishing virtual paths and boundaries within vessels to prevent procedural damage. Key findings reveal the system's capability to create tailored magnetic field gradient patterns for device control, considering the vessel's geometry and safety norms, and adapting to different blood flow characteristics for finer navigation. Additionally, the system's modeling aspect assesses the safety and feasibility of navigating pre-set vascular paths. Conclusively, this system, based on the Qt framework and C/C++, with specialized software modules, represents a major step forward in merging imaging technology with robotic aid, significantly enhancing precision and safety in intravascular procedures.

Title: EdgeSSVEP: A Fully Embedded SSVEP BCI Platform for Low-Power Real-Time Applications
Authors: Manh-Dat Nguyen, Thomas Do, Nguyen Thanh Trung Le, Xuan-The Tran, Fred Chang, Chin-Teng Lin
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) enable users to interact with machines directly via neural activity, yet their real-world deployment is often hindered by bulky and powerhungry hardware. We present EdgeSSVEP, a fully embedded microcontroller-based Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) BCI platform that performs real-time EEG acquisition, zero-phase filtering, and on-device classification within a lowpower 240 MHz MCU operating at only 222 mW. The system incorporates an 8-channel EEG front end, supports 5-second stimulus durations, and executes the entire SSVEP decoding pipeline locally, eliminating dependence on PC-based processing. EdgeSSVEP was evaluated using six stimulus frequencies (7, 8, 9, 11, 7.5, and 8.5 Hz) with 10 participants. The device achieved 99.17% classification accuracy and 27.33 bits/min Information Transfer Rate (ITR), while consuming substantially less power than conventional desktop-based systems. The system integrates motion sensing to support artifact detection and improve robustness and signal stability in practical environments. For development and debugging, the system also provides optional TCP data streaming to external clients. Overall, EdgeSSVEP offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and secure embedded BCI platform suitable for assistive communication and neurofeedback applications, with potential extensions to accelerometer-based artifact mitigation and broader real-world deployments.

Title: A Survey on Applications of Quantum Computing for Unit Commitment
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Ali Rajabi, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods. Key modeling strategies, hardware implementations, and computational trade-offs are discussed, highlighting the current progress, limitations, and potential future directions for large-scale quantum-enabled UC.

Title: DDNet: A Dual-Stream Graph Learning and Disentanglement Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization
Authors: Boyang Zhao, Xin Liao, Jiaxin Chen, Xiaoshuai Wu, Yufeng Wu
Abstract: The rapid evolution of AIGC technology enables misleading viewers by tampering mere small segments within a video, rendering video-level detection inaccurate and unpersuasive. Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features. Experiments on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 9\% in AP@0.95, with significant improvements in cross-domain robustness.

Title: Distributed Federated Learning by Alternating Periods of Training
Authors: Shamik Bhattacharyya, Rachel Kalpana Kalaimani
Abstract: Federated learning is a privacy-focused approach towards machine learning where models are trained on client devices with locally available data and aggregated at a central server. However, the dependence on a single central server is challenging in the case of a large number of clients and even poses the risk of a single point of failure. To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical claims through numerical simulations.

Title: Pathwise Representation of the Smoothing Distribution in Continuous-Time Linear Gaussian Models
Authors: Masahiro Kurisaki
Abstract: We study the filtering and smoothing problem for continuous-time linear Gaussian systems. While classical approaches such as the Kalman-Bucy filter and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother provide recursive formulas for the conditional mean and covariance, we present a pathwise perspective that characterizes the smoothing error dynamics as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As an application, we show that standard filtering and smoothing equations can be uniformly derived as corollaries of our main theorem. In particular, we provide the first mathematically rigorous derivation of the Bryson-Frazier smoother in the continuous-time setting. Beyond offering a more transparent understanding of the smoothing distribution, our formulation enables pathwise sampling from it, which facilitates Monte Carlo methods for evaluating nonlinear functionals.

Title: Ageing Monitoring for Commercial Microcontrollers Based on Timing Windows
Authors: Leandro Lanzieri, Jiri Kral, Goerschwin Fey, Holger Schlarb, Thomas C. Schmidt
Abstract: Microcontrollers are increasingly present in embedded deployments and dependable applications, for which malfunctions due to hardware ageing can have severe impact. The lack of deployable techniques for ageing monitoring on these devices has spread the application of guard bands to prevent timing errors due to degradation. Applying this static technique can limit performance and lead to sudden failures as devices age. In this paper, we follow a software-based self-testing approach to design monitoring of hardware degradation for microcontrollers. Deployable in the field, our technique leverages timing windows of variable lengths to determine the maximum operational frequency of the devices. We empirically validate the method on real hardware and find that it consistently detects temperature-induced degradations in maximum operating frequency of up to 13.79 % across devices for 60 °C temperature increase.

Title: Towards Multi-Level Transcript Segmentation: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Table-of-Contents Generation
Authors: Steffen Freisinger, Philipp Seeberger, Thomas Ranzenberger, Tobias Bocklet, Korbinian Riedhammer
Abstract: Segmenting speech transcripts into thematic sections benefits both downstream processing and users who depend on written text for accessibility. We introduce a novel approach to hierarchical topic segmentation in transcripts, generating multi-level tables of contents that capture both topic and subtopic boundaries. We compare zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning on large language models, while also exploring the integration of high-level speech pause features. Evaluations on English meeting recordings and multilingual lecture transcripts (Portuguese, German) show significant improvements over established topic segmentation baselines. Additionally, we adapt a common evaluation measure for multi-level segmentation, taking into account all hierarchical levels within one metric.

Title: Power-of-Two Quantization-Aware-Training (PoT-QAT) in Large Language Models (LLMs)
Authors: Mahmoud Elgenedy
Abstract: In Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, e.g., from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT-2 to 175 billion in GPT-3 to possibly more than trillion in higher versions. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision.

Title: DARC: Drum accompaniment generation with fine-grained rhythm control
Authors: Trey Brosnan
Abstract: In music creation, rapid prototyping is essential for exploring and refining ideas, yet existing generative tools often fall short when users require both structural control and stylistic flexibility. Prior approaches in stem-to-stem generation can condition on other musical stems but offer limited control over rhythm, and timbre-transfer methods allow users to specify specific rhythms, but cannot condition on musical context. We introduce DARC, a generative drum accompaniment model that conditions both on musical context from other stems and explicit rhythm prompts such as beatboxing or tapping tracks. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we augment STAGE, a state-of-the-art drum stem generator, with fine-grained rhythm control while maintaining musical context awareness.

Title: COMPASS: High-Efficiency Deep Image Compression with Arbitrary-scale Spatial Scalability
Authors: Jongmin Park, Jooyoung Lee, Munchurl Kim
Abstract: Recently, neural network (NN)-based image compression studies have actively been made and has shown impressive performance in comparison to traditional methods. However, most of the works have focused on non-scalable image compression (single-layer coding) while spatially scalable image compression has drawn less attention although it has many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel NN-based spatially scalable image compression method, called COMPASS, which supports arbitrary-scale spatial scalability. Our proposed COMPASS has a very flexible structure where the number of layers and their respective scale factors can be arbitrarily determined during inference. To reduce the spatial redundancy between adjacent layers for arbitrary scale factors, our COMPASS adopts an inter-layer arbitrary scale prediction method, called LIFF, based on implicit neural representation. We propose a combined RD loss function to effectively train multiple layers. Experimental results show that our COMPASS achieves BD-rate gain of -58.33% and -47.17% at maximum compared to SHVC and the state-of-the-art NN-based spatially scalable image compression method, respectively, for various combinations of scale factors. Our COMPASS also shows comparable or even better coding efficiency than the single-layer coding for various scale factors.

Title: Enhancing Blind Video Quality Assessment with Rich Quality-aware Features
Authors: Wei Sun, Linhan Cao, Jun Jia, Zhichao Zhang, Zicheng Zhang, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) is a highly challenging task due to the intrinsic complexity of video content and visual distortions, especially given the high popularity of social media videos, which originate from a wide range of sources, and are often processed by various compression and enhancement algorithms. While recent BVQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA) studies have made remarkable progress, their models typically perform well on the datasets they were trained on but generalize poorly to unseen videos, making them less effective for accurately evaluating the perceptual quality of diverse social media videos. In this paper, we propose Rich Quality-aware features enabled Video Quality Assessment (RQ-VQA), a simple yet effective method to enhance BVQA by leveraging rich quality-aware features extracted from off-the-shelf BIQA and BVQA models. Our approach exploits the expertise of existing quality assessment models within their trained domains to improve generalization. Specifically, we design a multi-source feature framework that integrates:(1) Learnable spatial features} from a base model fine-tuned on the target VQA dataset to capture domain-specific quality cues; (2) Temporal motion features from the fast pathway of SlowFast pre-trained on action recognition datasets to model motion-related distortions; (3) Spatial quality-aware features from BIQA models trained on diverse IQA datasets to enhance frame-level distortion representation; and (4) Spatiotemporal quality-aware features from a BVQA model trained on large-scale VQA datasets to jointly encode spatial structure and temporal dynamics. These features are concatenated and fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public social media VQA datasets.

Title: On the social bias of speech self-supervised models
Authors: Yi-Cheng Lin, Tzu-Quan Lin, Hsi-Che Lin, Andy T. Liu, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks, yet the biased outcomes, especially affecting marginalized groups, raise significant concerns. Social bias refers to the phenomenon where algorithms potentially amplify disparate properties between social groups present in the data used for training. Bias in SSL models can perpetuate injustice by automating discriminatory patterns and reinforcing inequitable systems. This work reveals that prevalent SSL models inadvertently acquire biased associations. We probe how various factors, such as model architecture, size, and training methodologies, influence the propagation of social bias within these models. Finally, we explore the efficacy of debiasing SSL models through regularization techniques, specifically via model compression. Our findings reveal that employing techniques such as row-pruning and training wider, shallower models can effectively mitigate social bias within SSL model.

Title: Assessment of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential and Future Cardiomyopathy from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Deep Learning in a Cardio-oncology Population
Authors: Jiarui Xing, Sangeon Ryu, Shawn Ahn, Jeacy Espinoza, James L. Cross, Stephanie Halene, James S. Duncan, Alokkumar Jha, Jennifer M Kwan, Nicha C. Dvornek
Abstract: We propose a novel deep learning framework to identify clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a somatic mutation condition associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, using routine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Utilizing 152 multi-view late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) scans from 136 cardio-oncology patients, we developed a convolutional neural network to (1) detect CHIP status and (2) stratify the risk of future cardiomyopathy specifically within the CHIP-positive cohort. To ensure robustness, we performed rigorous feature importance analysis to rule out reliance on demographic confounders such as age and immune checkpoint inhibitor usage. The model achieved an AUC of 0.71 for CHIP detection and, notably, an AUC of 0.87 for predicting future cardiomyopathy in CHIP-positive patients, significantly outperforming demographic-only baselines. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using LGE-CMR signatures as a non-invasive "radiogenomic" screening tool, potentially enabling accessible risk stratification and precision medicine for high-risk cardiovascular populations.

Title: Sufficient and Necessary Barrier-like Conditions for Safety and Reach-avoid Verification of Stochastic Discrete-time Systems
Authors: Bai Xue
Abstract: This paper investigates necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for infinite-horizon safety and reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems, derived via a relaxation of the Bellman equations. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on sufficient conditions, our work rigorously establishes both necessity and sufficiency for infinite-horizon properties. Safety verification concerns certifying that, starting from a given initial state, the system remains within a safe set at all future time steps with probability at least equal to a specified threshold. For this purpose, we formulate a necessary and sufficient barrier-like condition that captures this infinite-time safety property. In contrast, reach-avoid verification generalizes safety verification by also incorporating reachability. Specifically, it aims to ensure that the probability of the system, starting from a given initial state, eventually reaching a target set while remaining within the safe set until the first hit of the target is no less than a prescribed bound. Under suitable assumptions, we establish two necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for this reach-avoid specification.

Title: Two-Timescale Design for Movable Antenna-Enabled Multiuser MIMO Systems
Authors: Ziyuan Zheng, Qingqing Wu, Wen Chen, Guojie Hu
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), which can be swiftly repositioned within a defined region, offer a promising solution to the limitations of fixed-position antennas (FPAs) in adapting to spatial variations in wireless channels, thereby improving channel conditions and communication between transceivers. However, frequent MA position adjustments based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) incur high operational complexity, making real-time CSI acquisition impractical, especially in fast-fading channels. To address these challenges, we propose a two-timescale transmission framework for MA-enabled multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In the large timescale, statistical CSI is exploited to optimize MA positions for long-term ergodic performance, whereas, in the small timescale, beamforming vectors are designed using instantaneous CSI to handle short-term channel fluctuations. Within this new framework, we analyze the ergodic sum rate and develop efficient MA position optimization algorithms for both maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes. These algorithms employ alternating optimization (AO), successive convex approximation (SCA), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques, iteratively optimizing antenna positions and refining surrogate functions that approximate the ergodic sum rate. Numerical results show significant ergodic sum rate gains with the proposed two-timescale MA design over conventional FPA systems, particularly under moderate to strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. Notably, MA with ZF beamforming consistently outperforms MA with MRT, highlighting the synergy between beamforming and MAs for superior interference management in environments with moderate Rician factors and high user density, while MA with MRT can offer a simplified alternative to complex beamforming designs in strong LoS conditions.

Title: Dynamic Input Mapping Inversion to Eliminate Algebraic Loops in Hydraulic Actuator Control
Authors: Alessio Dallabona, Patrik Schermann, Mogens Blanke, Dimitrios Papageorgiou
Abstract: The application of nonlinear control schemes to electro-hydraulic actuators often requires several alterations in the design of the controllers during their implementation. This is to overcome challenges that frequently arise in such control algorithms owing to model nonlinearities. Moreover, advanced control solutions for this type of systems often introduce input algebraic loops that pose significant design and tuning difficulties. Conventional methods to avoid such loops introduce chatter, which considerably degrade tracking performance and has oil degradation and wear as side effects. This study presents a nonlinear control architecture for hydraulic actuators that comprises low-complexity modules that facilitate robust high performance in tracking and avoids the drawbacks of chatter. The salient feature is a dynamic input-mapping inversion module that avoids algebraic loops in the control input and is followed by dedicated position control. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using arguments from Lyapunov theory for cascaded non-autonomous nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated on a high-fidelity simulator of a wind turbine pitch system, and validated on a full-scale laboratory setup that includes a hydraulic pitch system and blade bearing. Appropriate quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the closed-loop system performance in comparison to a state-of-the-art nonlinear design.

Title: Bayesian uncertainty-aware deep learning with noisy labels: Tackling annotation ambiguity in EEG seizure detection
Authors: Deeksha M. Shama, Archana Venkataraman
Abstract: Deep learning is advancing EEG processing for automated epileptic seizure detection and onset zone localization, yet its performance relies heavily on high-quality annotated training data. However, scalp EEG is susceptible to high noise levels, which in turn leads to imprecise annotations of the seizure timing and characteristics. This "label noise" presents a significant challenge in model training and generalization. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian UncertaiNty-aware Deep Learning (BUNDL), a novel algorithm that informs a deep learning model of label ambiguities, thereby enhancing the robustness of seizure detection systems. By integrating domain knowledge into an underlying Bayesian framework, we derive a novel KL-divergence-based loss function that capitalizes on uncertainty to better learn seizure characteristics from scalp EEG. Thus, BUNDL offers a straightforward and model-agnostic method for training deep neural networks with noisy training labels that does not add any parameters to existing architectures. Additionally, we explore the impact of improved detection system on the task of automated onset zone localization. We validate BUNDL using a comprehensive simulated EEG dataset and two publicly available datasets collected by Temple University Hospital (TUH) and Boston Children's Hospital (CHB-MIT). Results show that BUNDL consistently identifies noisy labels and improves the robustness of three base models under various label noise conditions. We also evaluate cross-site generalizability and quantify computational cost of all methods. Ultimately, BUNDL presents as a reliable method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing deep models used in clinical practice, enabling the training of trustworthy models for epilepsy evaluation.

Title: Scan-Adaptive MRI Undersampling Using Neighbor-based Optimization (SUNO)
Authors: Siddhant Gautam, Angqi Li, Nicole Seiberlich, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Accelerated MRI involves collecting partial $k$-space measurements to reduce acquisition time, patient discomfort, and motion artifacts, and typically uses regular undersampling patterns or human-designed schemes. Recent works have studied population-adaptive sampling patterns learned from a group of patients (or scans). However, such patterns can be sub-optimal for individual scans, as they may fail to capture scan or slice-specific details, and their effectiveness can depend on the size and composition of the population. To overcome this issue, we propose a framework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns and a corresponding reconstruction model from a training set. We use an alternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and the reconstruction model where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline optimization of scan-adaptive $k$-space sampling patterns for each example in the training set. A nearest neighbor search is then used to select the scan-adaptive sampling pattern at test time from initially acquired low-frequency $k$-space information. We applied the proposed framework (dubbed SUNO) to the fastMRI multi-coil knee and brain datasets, demonstrating improved performance over the currently used undersampling patterns at both $4\times$ and $8\times$ acceleration factors in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The code for the proposed framework is available at this https URL.

Title: Stretching Rubber, Not Budgets: Accurate Parking Utilization on a Shoestring
Authors: Christopher K. Allsup
Abstract: Effective parking management is essential for ensuring safety and convenience in master-planned communities, particularly in active adult neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth. Accurately assessing parking utilization is a crucial first step in planning for future demand, but data collection methods can be costly and labor-intensive. This paper presents a low-cost yet highly accurate methodology for measuring parking utilization using pneumatic road tubes connected to portable traffic counters from JAMAR Technologies, Inc. By integrating results from JAMAR's analysis tool with custom Python scripting, the methodology enables precise parking lot counts through automated parameter optimization and error correction. The system's efficiency allows for scalable deployment without significant manual observation, reducing both costs and disruptions to daily operations. Using Tellico Village as a case study, this effort demonstrates that community planners can obtain actionable parking insights on a limited budget, empowering them to make informed decisions about capacity expansion and facility scheduling.

Title: Beamforming and Waveform Optimization for RF Wireless Power Transfer with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Amirhossein Azarbahram, Onel L. A. Lopez, Bruno Clerckx, Marco Di Renzo, Matti Latva-Aho
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology to seamlessly charge low-power devices, but its low end-to-end power transfer efficiency remains a critical challenge. To address the latter, low-cost transmit/radiating architectures, e.g., based on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have shown great potential. Beyond diagonal (BD) RIS is a novel branch of RIS offering enhanced performance over traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) in wireless communications, but its potential gains in RF-WPT remain unexplored. Motivated by this, we analyze a BD-RIS-assisted single-antenna RF-WPT system to charge a single rectifier, and formulate a joint beamforming and multi-carrier waveform optimization problem aiming to maximize the harvested power. We propose two solutions relying on semi-definite programming for fully connected BD-RIS, a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based beamforming approach, and an efficient low-complexity iterative method relying on SCA. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms converge and that adding transmit sub-carriers or RIS elements improves the harvesting performance. We show that the transmit power budget impacts the relative power allocation among different sub-carriers depending on the rectifier's operating regime, while BD-RIS shapes the cascade channel differently for frequency-selective and flat scenarios. Finally, we verify by simulation that BD-RIS and D-RIS achieve the same performance under pure far-field line-of-sight conditions (in the absence of mutual coupling). Meanwhile, BD-RIS outperforms D-RIS as the non-line-of-sight components of the channel become dominant.

Title: A Multi-Scale Attention-Based Attack Diagnosis Mechanism for Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks in Power Grids
Authors: Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao
Abstract: Parallel cyber--physical attacks (PCPA) can simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and disrupt measurement data transmission in power grids, severely impairing system situational awareness and attack diagnosis. This paper investigates the attack diagnosis problem for linearized AC/DC power flow models under PCPA, where physical attacks include not only line disconnections but also admittance modifications, such as those caused by compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-assisted attack diagnosis framework based on meta--mixed-integer programming (MMIP), which integrates a convolutional graph cross-attention attack localization (CGCA-AL) model. First, sufficient conditions for measurement reconstruction are derived, enabling the recovery of unknown measurements in attacked areas using available measurements and network topology information. Based on these conditions, the attack diagnosis problem is formulated as an MMIP model. The proposed CGCA-AL employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to predict a probability distribution over potential physical attack locations, which is incorporated into the MMIP as informative objective coefficients. By solving the resulting MMIP, both the locations and magnitudes of physical attacks are optimally estimated, and system states are subsequently reconstructed. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed attack diagnosis framework under complex PCPA scenarios.

Title: Multi-output Classification using a Cross-talk Architecture for Compound Fault Diagnosis of Motors in Partially Labeled Condition
Authors: Wonjun Yi, Wonho Jung, Hyeonuk Nam, Kangmin Jang, Yong-Hwa Park
Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled target datasets. Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for compound fault diagnosis under partially labeled conditions. Based on this investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk architecture, residual neural dimension reductor (RNDR), that enables selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition, frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup and evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the structural advantage of RNDR is more pronounced in compound fault settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods. Lastly, we analyzed the RNDR with various conditions, other models with increased number of parameters, and compared with the ablated RNDR structure.

Title: Nonlinear Oscillatory Response of Automated Vehicle Car-following: Theoretical Analysis with Traffic State and Control Input Limits
Authors: Sixu Li, Yang Zhou
Abstract: This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function (DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear oscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst traffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control input. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e., saturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string stability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically analyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by these limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal and oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is repositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base, DFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation components by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the associated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop nature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually influence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within the loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple solutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the reasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink, and further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm the alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior accuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the framework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when conventional linear methods offer misleading insights.

Authors: Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer, Aude Sportisse, Amirhossein Javaheri, Mohammed Nabil El Korso, Daniel P. Palomar
Abstract: This tutorial aims to provide signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) practitioners with vital tools, in an accessible way, to answer the question: How to deal with missing data? There are many strategies to handle incomplete signals. In this paper, we propose to group these strategies based on three common analytical tasks: i) missing-data imputation, ii) estimation with missing values and iii) prediction with missing values. We focus on methodological and experimental results through specific case studies on real-world applications. Promising and future research directions are also discussed. We hope that the proposed conceptual framework and the presentation of recent missing-data problems related will encourage researchers of the SP and ML communities to develop original methods and to efficiently deal with new applications involving missing data.

Title: Integrating Movable Antennas and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (MA-IRS): Fundamentals, Practical Solutions, and ISAC
Authors: Qingqing Wu, Ziyuan Zheng, Ying Gao, Weidong Mei, Xin Wei, Wen Chen, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) enable active antenna repositioning and passive phase-shift tuning for channel reconfiguration, respectively. Integrating MAs and IRSs boosts spatial degrees of freedom, significantly enhancing wireless network capacity, coverage, and reliability. In this article, we first present the fundamentals of MA-IRS integration, involving clarifying the key design issues, revealing performance gain, and identifying the conditions where MA-IRS synergy persists. Then, we examine practical challenges and propose pragmatic design solutions, including optimization schemes, hardware architectures, deployment strategies, and robust designs for hardware impairments and mobility management. In addition, we highlight how MA-IRS architectures uniquely support advanced integrated sensing and communication, enhancing sensing performance and dual-functional flexibility. Overall, MA-IRS integration emerges as a compelling approach toward next-generation reconfigurable wireless systems.

Title: The Frequency Response of Networks as Open Systems
Authors: Amirhossein Nazerian, Malbor Asllani, Melvyn Tyloo, Wai Lim Ku, Francesco Sorrentino
Abstract: Many biological, technological, and social systems can be effectively described as networks of interacting subsystems. Typically, these networks are not isolated objects, but interact with their environment through both signals and information that is received by specific nodes with an input function or released to the environment by other nodes with an output function. An important question is whether the structure of different networks, together with the particular selection of input and output nodes, is such that it favors the passing or blocking of such signals. For a given network and a given choice of the input and output nodes, the H2-norm provides a natural and general quantification of the extent to which input signals, whether deterministic or stochastic, periodic or arbitrary, are amplified. We analyze a diverse set of empirical networks and find that many naturally occurring systems, such as food webs, signaling pathways, and gene regulatory circuits, are structurally organized to enhance the passing of signals; in contrast, the structure of engineered systems like power grids appears to be intentionally designed to suppress signal propagation.

Title: Robust Control Design and Analysis Based on Lifting Linearization of Nonlinear Systems Under Uncertain Initial Conditions
Authors: Sourav Sinha, Mazen Farhood
Abstract: This paper presents a robust control synthesis and analysis framework for nonlinear systems with uncertain initial conditions. First, a deep learning-based lifting approach is proposed to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems with linear parameter-varying (LPV) state-space models in higher-dimensional spaces while simultaneously characterizing the uncertain initial states within the lifted state space. Then, convex synthesis conditions are provided to generate full-state feedback nonstationary LPV (NSLPV) controllers for the lifted LPV system. A performance measure similar to the l2-induced norm is used to provide robust performance guarantees in the presence of exogenous disturbances and uncertain initial conditions. The paper also includes results for synthesizing full-state feedback linear time-invariant controllers and output feedback NSLPV controllers. Additionally, a robustness analysis approach based on integral quadratic constraint (IQC) theory is developed to analyze and tune the synthesized controllers while accounting for noise associated with state measurements. This analysis approach characterizes model parameters and disturbance inputs using IQCs to reduce conservatism. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.

Title: The ECME Algorithm Using Factor Analysis for DOA Estimation in Nonuniform Noise
Authors: Mingyan Gong
Abstract: Factor analysis (FA) plays a critical role in psychometrics, econometrics, and statistics. Recently, maximum likelihood FA (MLFA) has been applied to direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and a variety of iterative approaches have been developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN) method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In this article, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm, an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed again for MLFA by introducing new complete data, which can thus use two explicit formulas to sequentially update the estimates of parameters at each iteration and have excellent convergence properties. Theoretical analysis shows that the ECME algorithm has almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method. However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable convergence and the convergence to the global optimum is easier. Importantly, MLFA is not the best choice for the subspace based DOA estimation in unknown nonuniform noise.

Title: Explainable AI Technique in Lung Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Nishan Rai, Sujan Khatri, Devendra Risal
Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Title: Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model
Authors: Hyun-Jic Oh, Junsik Kim, Zhiyi Shi, Yichen Wu, Yu-An Chen, Peter K Sorger, Hanspeter Pfister, Won-Ki Jeong
Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions by utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

Title: Pricing Short-Circuit Current via a Primal-Dual Formulation for Preserving Integrality Constraints
Authors: Peng Wang, Luis Badesa
Abstract: Synchronous Generators (SGs) currently provide important levels of Short-Circuit Current (SCC), a critical ancillary service that ensures line protections trip during short-circuit faults. Given the ongoing replacement of SGs by power-electronics-based generation, which have a hard limit for current injection, it has become relevant to optimize the procurement of SCC provided by remaining SGs. Pricing this service is however challenging due to the integrality constraints in Unit Commitment (UC). Existing methods, e.g., dispatchable pricing, restricted pricing and marginal unit pricing, attempt to address this issue but exhibit limitations in handling binary variables, resulting in SCC prices that either fail to cover the operating costs of units or lack interpretability. To overcome these pitfalls, we propose a primal-dual formulation of the SCC-constrained dispatch that preserves the binary nature of UC while effectively computing shadow prices of SCC services. Using a modified IEEE 30-bus system, a comparison is carried out between the proposed approach and the state-of-the-art pricing schemes, highlighting the advantages of the primal-dual method in preserving UC integrality for SCC pricing.

Title: Model-based Deep Learning for Joint RIS Phase Shift Compression and WMMSE Beamforming
Authors: Alexander James Fernandes, Ioannis Psaromiligkos
Abstract: A model-based deep learning (DL) architecture is proposed for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-user communications to reduce the overhead of transmitting phase shift information from the access point (AP) to the RIS controller. The phase shifts are computed at the AP, which has access to the channel state information, and then encoded into a compressed binary control message that is sent to the RIS controller for element configuration. To help reduce beamformer mismatches due to phase shift compression errors, the beamformer is updated using weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) based on the effective channel resulting from the actual (decompressed) RIS reflection coefficients. By unrolling the iterative WMMSE algorithm as part of the wireless communication informed DL architecture, joint phase shift compression and WMMSE beamforming can be trained end-to-end. Simulations show that accounting for phase shift compression errors during beamforming significantly improves the sum-rate performance, even when the number of control bits is lower than the number of RIS elements.

Title: Training-Free Adaptive Quantization for Variable Rate Image Coding for Machines
Authors: Yui Tatsumi, Ziyue Zeng, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has become increasingly important with the rapid integration of computer vision technology into real-world applications. However, most neural network-based ICM frameworks operate at a fixed rate, thus requiring individual training for each target bitrate. This limitation may restrict their practical usage. Existing variable rate image compression approaches mitigate this issue but often rely on additional training, which increases computational costs and complicates deployment. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free framework for quantization strength control which enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By exploiting the scale parameter predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method adaptively modulates quantization step sizes across both channel and spatial dimensions. This allows the model to preserve semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. Our architectural design further enables continuous bitrate control through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate baseline.

Title: Distributed Koopman Operator Learning for Perception and Safe Navigation
Authors: Ali Azarbahram, Shenyu Liu, Gian Paolo Incremona
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and scalable framework for predictive and safe autonomous navigation in dynamic transportation environments by integrating model predictive control (MPC) with distributed Koopman operator learning. High-dimensional sensory data are employed to model and forecast the motion of surrounding dynamic obstacles. A consensus-based distributed Koopman learning algorithm enables multiple computational agents or sensing units to collaboratively estimate the Koopman operator without centralized data aggregation, thereby supporting large-scale and communication-efficient learning across a networked system. The learned operator predicts future spatial densities of obstacles, which are subsequently represented through Gaussian mixture models. Their confidence ellipses are approximated by convex polytopes and embedded as linear constraints in the MPC formulation to guarantee safe and collision-free navigation. The proposed approach not only ensures obstacle avoidance but also scales efficiently with the number of sensing or computational nodes, aligning with cooperative perception principles in autonomous navigation applications. Theoretical convergence guarantees and predictive constraint formulations are established, and extensive simulations demonstrate reliable, safe, and computationally efficient navigation performance in complex environments.

Title: Confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection for ballistocardiogram using template matching and deep learning
Authors: Dongli Cai, Xihe Chen, Yaosheng Chen, Hong Xian, Baoxian Yu, Han Zhang
Abstract: Heartbeat interval can be detected from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals in a non-contact manner. Conventional methods achieved heartbeat detection from different perspectives, where template matching (TM) and deep learning (DL) were based on the similarity of neighboring heartbeat episodes and robust spatio-temporal characteristics, respectively, and thus, performed varied from case to case. Inspired by the above facts, we propose confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection using both TM and DL, and further explore the advantages of both methods in various scenarios. To be specific, the confidence of the heartbeat detection results was evaluated by the consistency of signal morphology and the variability of the detected heartbeat intervals, which could be formulated by the averaged correlation between each heartbeat episode and the detected template and the normalized standard deviation among detected heartbeat intervals, respectively, where the results with higher confidence were remained. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, we conducted experiments using practical clinical BCG dataset with 34 subjects including 924,235 heartbeats. Numerical results showed that the proposed hybrid method achieved an average absolute interval error of 20.73 ms, yielding a reduction of 29.28 ms and 10.13 ms compared to solo TM and DL methods, respectively. Besides, case study showed the robustness of heartbeat detection of TM and DL to individual differences and signal quality, respectively, and in turn, validated that the hybrid method could benefit from the complementary advantages of both methods, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed hybrid method in practical BCG monitoring scenarios.

Title: Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Bin Xu, Ayan Banerjee, Sandeep Gupta
Abstract: Neural networks have become a dominant computational workload across cloud and edge platforms, but rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures; domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs/NPUs); FPGA-based designs; ASIC inference engines; and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs (language processing units), alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the space using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, and memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas including systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and we discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- and point to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.

Title: From Optimization to Control: Quasi Policy Iteration
Authors: Mohammad Amin Sharifi Kolarijani, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani
Abstract: Recent control algorithms for Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been designed using an implicit analogy with well-established optimization algorithms. In this paper, we adopt the quasi-Newton method (QNM) from convex optimization to introduce a novel control algorithm coined as quasi-policy iteration (QPI). In particular, QPI is based on a novel approximation of the ``Hessian'' matrix in the policy iteration algorithm, which exploits two linear structural constraints specific to MDPs and allows for the incorporation of prior information on the transition probability kernel. While the proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as value iteration, it exhibits an empirical convergence behavior similar to that of QNM with a low sensitivity to the discount factor.

Title: Any-Time Regret-Guaranteed Algorithm for Control of Linear Quadratic Systems
Authors: Jafar Abbaszadeh Chekan, Cedric Langbort
Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves anytime regret of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{t})$, with explicit dependence on the system dimensions and on the solution of the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE). Our approach builds on the SDP-based framework of \cite{cohen2019learning}, using an appropriately tuned regularization and a sufficiently accurate initial estimate to construct confidence ellipsoids for control design. A carefully designed input-perturbation mechanism is incorporated to ensure anytime performance. We develop two variants of the algorithm. The first enforces a notion of strong sequential stability, requiring each policy to be stabilizing and successive policies to remain close. However, enforcing this notion results in a suboptimal regret scaling. The second removes the sequential-stability requirement and instead requires only that each generated policy be stabilizing. Closed-loop stability is then preserved through a dwell-time-inspired policy-update rule, adapting ideas from switched-systems control to carefully balance exploration and exploitation. This class of algorithms also addresses key shortcomings of most existing approaches including certainty-equivalence-based methods which typically guarantee stability only in the Lyapunov sense and lack explicit uniform high-probability bounds on the state trajectory expressed in system-theoretic terms. Our analysis explicitly characterizes the trade-off between state amplification and regret, and shows that partially relaxing the sequential-stability requirement yields optimal regret. Finally, our method eliminates the need for any a priori bound on the norm of the DARE solution, an assumption required by all existing computationally efficient optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) based algorithms, and thereby removes the reliance of regret guarantees on such external inputs.

Title: P2U-SLAM: A Monocular Wide-FoV SLAM System Based on Point Uncertainty and Pose Uncertainty
Authors: Yufan Zhang, Kailun Yang, Ze Wang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: This paper presents P2U-SLAM, a visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system with a wide Field of View (FoV) camera, which utilizes pose uncertainty and point uncertainty. While the wide FoV enables considerable repetitive observations of historical map points for matching cross-view features, the data properties of the historical map points and the poses of historical keyframes have changed during the optimization process. The neglect of data property changes results in the lack of partial information matrices in optimization, increasing the risk of long-term positioning performance degradation. The purpose of our research is to mitigate the risks posed by wide-FoV visual input to the SLAM system. Based on the conditional probability model, this work reveals the definite impacts of the above data properties changes on the optimization process, concretizes these impacts as point uncertainty and pose uncertainty, and gives their specific mathematical form. P2U-SLAM embeds point uncertainty into the tracking module and pose uncertainty into the local mapping module respectively, and updates these uncertainties after each optimization operation including local mapping, map merging, and loop closing. We present an exhaustive evaluation on 27 sequences from two popular public datasets with wide-FoV visual input. P2U-SLAM shows excellent performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: pyAMPACT: A Score-Audio Alignment Toolkit for Performance Data Estimation and Multi-modal Processing
Authors: Johanna Devaney, Daniel McKemie, Alex Morgan
Abstract: pyAMPACT (Python-based Automatic Music Performance Analysis and Comparison Toolkit) links symbolic and audio music representations to facilitate score-informed estimation of performance data in audio as well as general linking of symbolic and audio music representations with a variety of annotations. pyAMPACT can read a range of symbolic formats and can output note-linked audio descriptors/performance data into MEI-formatted files. The audio analysis uses score alignment to calculate time-frequency regions of importance for each note in the symbolic representation from which to estimate a range of parameters. These include tuning-, dynamics-, and timbre-related performance descriptors, with timing-related information available from the score alignment. Beyond performance data estimation, pyAMPACT also facilitates multi-modal investigations through its infrastructure for linking symbolic representations and annotations to audio.

Title: Secure Semantic Communication With Homomorphic Encryption
Authors: Rui Meng, Dayu Fan, Haixiao Gao, Yifan Yuan, Bizhu Wang, Xiaodong Xu, Mengying Sun, Chen Dong, Xiaofeng Tao, Ping Zhang, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom), which aims to achieve efficient and reliable transmission of meaning between agents, has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. To ensure the security of communication systems, encryption techniques are employed to safeguard confidentiality and integrity. However, existing encryption schemes encounter obstacles when applied to SemCom. To address this issue, this paper explores the feasibility of applying homomorphic encryption (HE) to SemCom. Initially, we review the encryption algorithms utilized in mobile communication systems and analyze the challenges associated with their application to SemCom. Subsequently, we overview HE techniques and employ scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to demonstrate that the extractable semantic information can be preserved in homomorphic encrypted ciphertext. Based on this finding, we further propose the HE-joint source-channel coding (HE-JSCC) scheme, where the traditional JSCC model architecture is modified to support HE operations. Moreover, we present the simulation results for image classification and image generation tasks. Furthermore, we provide potential future research directions for homomorphic encrypted SemCom.

Title: No Minima, No Collisions: Combining Modulation and Control Barrier Function Strategies for Feasible Dynamic Collision Avoidance
Authors: Yifan Xue, Nadia Figueroa
Abstract: Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) have become a central tool for real-time safety-critical control due to their applicability to general control-affine systems and their ability to enforce constraints through optimization. Yet, they often generate trajectories with undesirable local minima that prevent convergence to goals. On the other hand, Modulation of Dynamical Systems (Mod-DS) methods (including normal, reference, and on-manifold variants) reshape nominal vector fields geometrically and achieve obstacle avoidance with few or even no local minima. However, Mod-DS provides no straightforward mechanism for handling input constraints and remains largely restricted to fully actuated systems. In this paper, we revisit the theoretical foundations of both approaches and show that, despite their seemingly different constructions, the normal Mod-DS is a special case of the CBF-QP, and the reference Mod-DS is linked to the CBF-QP through a single shared equation. These connections motivate our Modulated CBF-QP (MCBF-QP) framework, which introduces reference and on-manifold modulation variants that reduce or fully eliminate the spurious equilibria inherent to CBF-QPs for general control-affine systems operating in dynamic, cluttered environments. We validate the proposed controllers in simulated hospital settings and in real-world experiments on fully actuated Ridgeback robots and underactuated Fetch platforms. Across all evaluations, Modulated CBF-QPs consistently outperform standard CBF-QPs on every performance metric.

Title: AdGT: Decentralized Gradient Tracking with Tuning-free Per-Agent Stepsize
Authors: Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT achieves linear convergence to the global optimal solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.

Title: Generalized Scattering Matrix Framework for Modeling Implantable Antennas in Multilayered Spherical Media
Authors: Chenbo Shi, Xin Gu, Shichen Liang, Jin Pan
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and computationally efficient framework for modeling antennas embedded in spherically stratified media, applicable to implantable biomedical antennas and radome-enclosed systems. The method separates the characterization of the radiator from that of the surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering operators (SSOs). This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation under arbitrary changes of the spherical medium without re-simulating the antenna, yielding orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional DGF-based MoM approaches. The SSO formulation accommodates multilayer, radially inhomogeneous, and radially uniaxial anisotropic profiles, and the GSM can be obtained from diverse numerical solvers or far-field data, supporting array-level synthesis and measurement-driven modeling. Extensive examples confirm excellent agreement with full-wave and DGF-based solutions, demonstrating the accuracy, generality, and practical versatility of the proposed framework.

Title: Perch 2.0: The Bittern Lesson for Bioacoustics
Authors: Bart van Merriënboer, Vincent Dumoulin, Jenny Hamer, Lauren Harrell, Andrea Burns, Tom Denton
Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for bioacoustics.

Title: A 240 Elements Matrix Probe with Aberration Mask for 4D Carotid Artery Computational Ultrasound Imaging
Authors: Yuyang Hu, Michael Brown, Didem Dogan, Mahé Bulot, Maxime Cheppe, Guillaume Ferin, Geert Leus, Antonius F.W. van der Steen, Pieter Kruizinga, Johannes G. Bosch
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides enhanced visualization of the carotid artery (CA) anatomy and volumetric flow, offering improved accuracy for cardiovascular diagnosis and monitoring. However, fully populated matrix transducers with large apertures are complex and costly to implement. Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) offers a promising alternative by enabling simplified hardware design through model-based reconstruction and spatial field encoding. In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 x 24 mm$^2$ large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system's design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications.

Title: Convergence Filters for Efficient Economic MPC of Non-dissipative Systems
Authors: Defeng He, Weiliang Xiong, Shaoyuan Li, Haiping Du
Abstract: This note presents a novel and efficient Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme specifically designed for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. To address the stability challenge of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems, a new concept of convergence filters is introduced. Three alternative convergence filters are designed accordingly to be incorporated into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon approach without explicit terminal state constraints is adopted. This design allows for a flexible trade-off among convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden via simple parameter adjustment. Moreover, sufficient conditions are rigorously derived to guarantee recursive feasibility and stability. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated through simulations on a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.

Title: CMDAR: A Chinese Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark with Diverse Challenges
Authors: Hui Li, Changhao Jiang, Hongyu Wang, Ming Zhang, Jiajun Sun, Zhixiong Yang, Yifei Cao, Shihan Dou, Xiaoran Fan, Baoyu Fan, Tao Ji, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang
Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and English audio data and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce CMDAR, a Chinese benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. CMDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on CMDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. In CMDAR-main, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio reaches 68.47%. However, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice with multiple audios and open-ended tasks. And we provide detail analysis corresponding suggestions for the future development of large audio language models.

Title: On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging
Authors: Sabbir Ahmed, Hafiz Fareed Ahmed, Erfan Nozari
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.

Title: SPARC: Spine with Prismatic and Revolute Compliance for Quadruped Robots
Authors: Yue Wang
Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three torque-controlled actuators, a 1~kHz control board, and protected power electronics in a 1.26~kg package. A floating-base impedance controller with dynamics compensation renders tunable spring-damper behavior along horizontal, vertical, and rotational axes. Benchtop experiments validate the approach: quasi-static tests demonstrate linear force-displacement characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300--700~N/m ($\leq 1.5\%$ error, $R^2 \geq 0.992$), while dynamic trials confirm predictable damping behavior across multiple settings. Furthermore, simulation studies reveal that adapting spine stiffness based on terrain slope and stride length significantly reduces the cost of transport. SPARC provides an open-source platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion, with complete hardware and firmware resources available for community use.

Title: PIKAN: Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Explainable UAV Channel Modelling
Authors: Kürşat Tekbıyık, Güneş Karabulut Kurt, Antoine Lesage-Landry
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and 6G networks.

Title: Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for health indicator extraction from guided waves in aerospace composite structures
Authors: James Josep Perry, Pablo Garcia-Conde Ortiz, George Konstantinou, Cornelie Vergouwen, Edlyn Santha Kumaran, Morteza Moradi
Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents (e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies, which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved 81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Title: Generating Piano Music with Transformers: A Comparative Study of Scale, Data, and Metrics
Authors: Jonathan Lehmkuhl, Ábel Ilyés-Kun, Nico Bremes, Cemhan Kaan Özaltan, Frederik Muthers, Jiayi Yuan
Abstract: Although a variety of transformers have been proposed for symbolic music generation in recent years, there is still little comprehensive study on how specific design choices affect the quality of the generated music. In this work, we systematically compare different datasets, model architectures, model sizes, and training strategies for the task of symbolic piano music generation. To support model development and evaluation, we examine a range of quantitative metrics and analyze how well they correlate with human judgment collected through listening studies. Our best-performing model, a 950M-parameter transformer trained on 80K MIDI files from diverse genres, produces outputs that are often rated as human-composed in a Turing-style listening survey.

Title: Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN
Authors: Hamed Alimohammadi, Samara Mayhoub, Sotiris Chatzimiltis, Mohammad Shojafar, Muhammad Nasir Mumtaz Bhutta
Abstract: Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.

Abstract: Learning biophysically accurate solution operators for cardiac electrophysiology is fundamentally challenged by geometric variability across patient-specific heart anatomies. Most existing neural operator approaches are limited to structured or weakly deformed domains, restricting their applicability to realistic atrial and ventricular geometries. Here, we introduce a unified operator-learning framework that projects inputs and outputs onto a standardised anatomical coordinate system, decoupling electrophysiological dynamics from mesh topology. This formulation enables geometry-independent learning while preserving physiologically meaningful spatial organisation, and allows predictions to be interpolated back onto patient-specific geometries for anatomical interpretation. To support large-scale training within the framework, we develop a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver and generate over 300,000 high-fidelity simulations across diverse patient-specific left atrial geometries with varied pacing and conduction properties. Within this anatomical coordinate domain, we design a neural operator to predict full-field local activation time maps, achieving a mean absolute error of 5.1 ms and an inference time of 0.12 ms per sample, outperforming existing operator learning and convolutional baselines. We further validate the framework on ventricular geometries, demonstrating robust generalisation beyond the atrial setting. Together, this framework establishes a scalable foundation for fast, geometry-invariant cardiac electrophysiology modelling, with potential relevance for real-time and population-scale clinical workflows.

Title: Auditing Human Decision-Making in High-Stakes Environments via Prescriptive AI: A Stress-Test on Real-Time Tactical Management
Authors: Pedro Passos, Patrick Moratori
Abstract: High-stakes decision-making is often compromised by cognitive biases and outcome dependency. Current AI models typically mimic historical human behavior, inheriting these biases and limiting their utility for normative improvement. Here, we introduce a Prescriptive AI framework designed to audit, rather than automate, human judgment in real-time environments. By decoupling decision quality from stochastic outcomes, we quantify "decision latency" and status quo bias in elite soccer management - a high-pressure adversarial domain. Analyzing 2018 FIFA World Cup data, our system exposes critical risk states, such as performance collapse following salient positive events (e.g., an assist), which human experts systematically overlook due to outcome bias. These findings demonstrate that interpretable auditing systems can reveal structural flaws in human reasoning that predictive models obscure. This approach establishes a paradigm for Human-AI interaction prioritizing epistemic accountability over predictive mimicry in safety-critical domains.

Title: A Universal and Robust Framework for Multiple Gas Recognition Based-on Spherical Normalization-Coupled Mahalanobis Algorithm
Authors: Shuai Chen, Yang Song, Chen Wang, Ziran Wang
Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face two interconnected challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shift caused by signal drift and decision boundary failure induced by unknown gas interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance or conventional classifiers, failing to account for anisotropic feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes the Spherical Normalization coupled Mahalanobis (SNM) module, a universal post-processing module for open-set gas recognition. First, it achieves geometric decoupling through cascaded batch and L2 normalization, projecting features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Second, it utilizes Mahalanobis distance to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries that conform to the anisotropic feature geometry. The architecture-agnostic SNM-Module seamlessly integrates with mainstream backbones including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Transformer. Experiments on the public Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration achieves near-theoretical-limit performance in discriminating among multiple target gases, with an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% at 5% false positive rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a 3.0% AUROC improvement and 91.0% standard deviation reduction compared to Class Anchor Clustering (CAC). The module maintains exceptional robustness across five sensor positions, with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively addresses the critical challenge of simultaneously achieving high accuracy and high stability in open-set gas recognition, providing solid support for industrial E-nose deployment.
