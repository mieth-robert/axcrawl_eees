Title: Improving the Plausibility of Pressure Distributions Synthesized from Depth through Generative Modeling
Authors: Neevkumar Manavar, Hanno Gerd Meyer, Joachim Waßmuth, Barbara Hammer, Axel Schneider
Abstract: Monitoring contact pressure in hospital beds is essential for preventing pressure ulcers and enabling real-time patient assessment. Current methods can predict pressure maps but often lack physical plausibility, limiting clinical reliability. This work proposes a framework that enhances plausibility via Informed Latent Space (ILS) and Weight Optimization Loss (WOL) with generative modeling to produce high-fidelity, physically consistent pressure estimates. This study also applies diffusion based conditional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) and proposes training strategy for its latent counterpart Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (LBBDM) tailored for pressure synthesis in lying postures. Experiment results shows proposed method improves physical plausibility and performance over baselines: BBDM with ILS delivers highly detailed maps at higher computational cost and large inference time, whereas LBBDM provides faster inference with competitive performance. Overall, the approach supports non-invasive, vision-based, real-time patient monitoring in clinical environments.

Title: Towards Deep Learning Surrogate for the Forward Problem in Electrocardiology: A Scalable Alternative to Physics-Based Models
Authors: Shaheim Ogbomo-Harmitt, Cesare Magnetti, Chiara Spota, Jakub Grzelak, Oleg Aslanidi
Abstract: The forward problem in electrocardiology, computing body surface potentials from cardiac electrical activity, is traditionally solved using physics-based models such as the bidomain or monodomain equations. While accurate, these approaches are computationally expensive, limiting their use in real-time and large-scale clinical applications. We propose a proof-of-concept deep learning (DL) framework as an efficient surrogate for forward solvers. The model adopts a time-dependent, attention-based sequence-to-sequence architecture to predict electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from cardiac voltage propagation maps. A hybrid loss combining Huber loss with a spectral entropy term was introduced to preserve both temporal and frequency-domain fidelity. Using 2D tissue simulations incorporating healthy, fibrotic, and gap junction-remodelled conditions, the model achieved high accuracy (mean $R^2 = 0.99 \pm 0.01$). Ablation studies confirmed the contributions of convolutional encoders, time-aware attention, and spectral entropy loss. These findings highlight DL as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to physics-based solvers, with potential for clinical and digital twin applications.

Title: Delay Optimization in a Simple Offloading System: Extended Version
Authors: Darin Jeff, Eytan Modiano
Abstract: We consider a computation offloading system where jobs are processed sequentially at a local server followed by a higher-capacity cloud server. The system offers two service modes, differing in how the processing is split between the servers. Our goal is to design an optimal policy for assigning jobs to service modes and partitioning server resources in order to minimize delay. We begin by characterizing the system's stability region and establishing design principles for service modes that maximize throughput. For any given job assignment strategy, we derive the optimal resource partitioning and present a closed-form expression for the resulting delay. Moreover, we establish that the delay-optimal assignment policy exhibits a distinct breakaway structure: at low system loads, it is optimal to route all jobs through a single service mode, whereas beyond a critical load threshold, jobs must be assigned across both modes. We conclude by validating these theoretical insights through numerical evaluation.

Title: A Convex Obstacle Avoidance Formulation
Authors: Ricardo Tapia, Iman Soltani
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires reliable collision avoidance in dynamic environments. Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (NMPCs) are suitable for this task, but struggle in time-critical scenarios requiring high frequency. To meet this demand, optimization problems are often simplified via linearization, narrowing the horizon window, or reduced temporal nodes, each compromising accuracy or reliability. This work presents the first general convex obstacle avoidance formulation, enabled by a novel approach to integrating logic. This facilitates the incorporation of an obstacle avoidance formulation into convex MPC schemes, enabling a convex optimization framework with substantially improved computational efficiency relative to conventional nonconvex methods. A key property of the formulation is that obstacle avoidance remains effective even when obstacles lie outside the prediction horizon, allowing shorter horizons for real-time deployment. In scenarios where nonconvex formulations are unavoidable, the proposed method meets or exceeds the performance of representative nonconvex alternatives. The method is evaluated in autonomous vehicle applications, where system dynamics are highly nonlinear.

Title: Interference Mitigation using U-Net Autoencoder based system
Authors: Hiten Prakash Kothari, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: This paper proposes a U-Net-based autoencoder framework for mitigating interference in communication signals corrupted by noise and diverse interference sources. The approach targets scenarios involving both signal-plus-noise and signal-plus-interference-plus-noise mixtures, including sinusoidal interferers, LFM chirps, QPSK interferers with different sampling rates, and modulated interference such as QAM. The U-Net architecture leverages multiscale feature extraction and skip connections to preserve fine-grained temporal structure while suppressing interference components. Performance is evaluated using bit error rate and compared against conventional cancellation methods. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional techniques in low- and mid-SIR regimes, while remaining competitive at high SIRs. Additional experiments examine the autoencoder's behavior under model mismatch conditions such as carrier offset and colored noise. The study demonstrates that multiscale neural architectures provide a flexible and effective platform for interference mitigation across a wide range of interference types.

Title: Pipeline Stage Resolved Timing Characterization of FPGA and ASIC Implementations of a RISC V Processor
Authors: Mostafa Darvishi
Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline stage resolved timing characterization of a 32-bit RISC V processor implemented on a 20 nm FPGA and a 7 nm FinFET ASIC platform. A unified analysis framework is introduced that decomposes timing paths into logic, routing, and clocking components and maps them to well-defined pipeline stage transitions. This approach enables systematic comparison of timing behavior across heterogeneous implementation technologies at a microarchitectural level. Using static timing analysis and statistical characterization, the study shows that although both implementations exhibit dominant critical paths in the EX to MEM pipeline transition, their underlying timing mechanisms differ fundamentally. FPGA timing is dominated by routing parasitics and placement dependent variability, resulting in wide slack distributions and sensitivity to routing topology. In contrast, ASIC timing is governed primarily by combinational logic depth and predictable parametric variation across process, voltage, and temperature corners, yielding narrow and stable timing distributions. The results provide quantitative insight into the structural origins of timing divergence between programmable and custom fabrics and demonstrate the effectiveness of pipeline stage resolved analysis for identifying platform specific bottlenecks. Based on these findings, the paper derives design implications for achieving predictable timing closure in processor architectures targeting both FPGA and ASIC implementations.

Title: Safe Online Control-Informed Learning
Authors: Tianyu Zhou, Zihao Liang, Zehui Lu, Shaoshuai Mou
Abstract: This paper proposes a Safe Online Control-Informed Learning framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The framework unifies optimal control, parameter estimation, and safety constraints into an online learning process. It employs an extended Kalman filter to incrementally update system parameters in real time, enabling robust and data-efficient adaptation under uncertainty. A softplus barrier function enforces constraint satisfaction during learning and control while eliminating the dependence on high-quality initial guesses. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence and safety guarantees, and the framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on cart-pole and robot-arm systems.

Title: Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography
Authors: Ricardo Gonçalves Molinari, Leonardo Abdala Elias
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the \textit{extensor digitorum communis} (EDC) and \textit{flexor digitorum superficialis} (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.

Title: A Fair, Flexible, Zero-Waste Digital Electricity Market: A First-Principles Approach Combining Automatic Market Making, Holarchic Architectures and Shapley Theory
Authors: Shaun Sweeney, Robert Shorten, Mark O'Malley
Abstract: This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics. Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes. The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule. Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution. Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes. The architecture is climate aligned and policy configurable, but requires a managed transition and new operational tools for system operators and market participants.

Title: Data-Driven Control via Conditional Mean Embeddings: Formal Guarantees via Uncertain MDP Abstraction
Authors: Ibon Gracia, Morteza Lahijanian
Abstract: Controlling stochastic systems with unknown dynamics and under complex specifications is specially challenging in safety-critical settings, where performance guarantees are essential. We propose a data-driven policy synthesis framework that yields formal performance guarantees for such systems using conditional mean embeddings (CMEs) and uncertain Markov decision processes (UMDPs). From trajectory data, we learn the system's transition kernel as a CME, then construct a finite-state UMDP abstraction whose transition uncertainties capture learning and discretization errors. Next, we generate a policy with formal performance bounds through robust dynamic programming. We demonstrate and empirically validate our method through a temperature regulation benchmark.

Title: Fundamental Limits of Localization with Fluid Antenna Systems: A Fisher Information Analysis
Authors: Abdelhamid Salem, Kai-Kit Wong, Hyundong Shin, Yangyang Zhang
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the fundamental limits of localization in fluid antenna systems (FAS) utilizing a Fisher-information-theoretic framework. We develop a unified model to quantify the localization information extractable from time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) measurements, explicitly capturing the synthetic aperture effects induced by FAS. Closed-form expressions are derived for the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) and the corresponding positioning error bound (PEB) in both user-side and base-station (BS)-side FAS configurations. Also, we propose optimal port-selection strategies based on greedy algorithms and convex relaxation to maximize the information gain under a constrained number of activated ports. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed port-selection schemes can substantially tighten the PEB compared with random activation, thereby confirming the strong potential of FAS to enable high-precision localization. These results offer analytical insights and practical design guidelines for FAS-aided positioning in future-generation wireless networks

Title: Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Access in Cognitive IoT Networks under Smart Jamming Attacks
Authors: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) network where a secondary user (SU) operates under both energy constraints and adversarial interference from a smart jammer. The SU coexists with primary users (PUs) and must ensure that its transmissions do not exceed a predefined interference threshold on licensed channels. At each time slot, the SU must jointly determine whether to transmit or harvest energy, which channel to access, and the appropriate transmit power while satisfying energy and interference constraints. Meanwhile, a smart jammer actively selects a channel to disrupt, aiming to degrade the SU's communication performance. This setting presents a significant challenge due to its multi-level decision structure and hybrid action space, which combines both discrete and continuous decisions. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (H-DDPG) framework that decomposes the decision-making process into three levels: the high-level policy determines the mode (transmit or harvest), the mid-level policy selects the channel, and the low-level actor outputs a continuous power level. Concurrently, the jammer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent that learns an adaptive channel jamming strategy using a discrete variant of DDPG. Simulation results show that our H-DDPG approach outperforms conventional flat reinforcement learning baselines.

Title: Cooperative Caching Towards Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive-IoT Networks
Authors: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.

Title: Cooperative Rotatable IRSs for Wireless Communications: Joint Beamforming and Orientation Optimization
Authors: Qiaoyan Peng, Qingqing Wu, Guangji Chen, Wen Chen, Shanpu Shen, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) introduce a new degree of freedom (DoF) for shaping wireless propagation by adaptively adjusting the orientation of IRSs. This paper considers an angle-dependent reflection model in a wireless communication system aided by two rotatable IRSs. Specifically, we study the joint design of the base station transmit beamforming, as well as the cooperative passive beamforming and orientation of the two IRSs, to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Under the light-of-sight (LoS) channels, we first develop a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based method to determine the IRS rotation and derive an optimal rotation in a closed-form expression for a two-dimensional IRS deployment. Then, we extend the design to the general Rician fading channels by proposing an efficient alternating optimization and PSO (AO-PSO) algorithm. Numerical results validate the substantial gains achieved by the IRS rotation over fixed-IRS schemes and also demonstrate the superior performance of the double rotatable IRSs over a single rotatable IRS given a sufficient total number of IRS elements.

Title: Scalable Frameworks for Real-World Audio-Visual Speech Recognition
Authors: Sungnyun Kim
Abstract: The practical deployment of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems is fundamentally challenged by significant performance degradation in real-world environments, characterized by unpredictable acoustic noise and visual interference. This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy. By systematically providing solutions at each of these three levels, this dissertation aims to build a next-generation, robust, and scalable AVSR system with high reliability in real-world applications.

Title: Synthetic Aperture for High Spatial Resolution Acoustoelectric Imaging
Authors: Wei Yi Oon, Yuchen Tang, Baiqian Qi, Wei-Ning Lee
Abstract: Acoustoelectric (AE) imaging provides electro-anatomical contrast by mapping the distribution of electric fields in biological tissues, by delivering ultrasound waves which spatially modulate the medium resistivity via the AE effect. The conventional method in AE imaging is to transmit focused ultrasound (FUS) beams; however, the depth-of-field (DOF) of FUS-AE is limited to the size of the focal spot, which does not span across the centimeter-scale of organs. Instead of fixing the focal depth on transmission, we propose to dynamically synthesize the AE modulation regions via a Synthetic Aperture approach (SA-AE). SA-AE involves a straightforward pixel-based delay-and-sum reconstruction of AE images from unfocused AE signals. In saline and ex vivo lobster nerve experiments, FUS-AE was shown to perform well only at the focal depth, with poor spatial resolution for out-of-focus electric sources. Meanwhile, SA-AE generally improved spatial resolution throughout the DOF, but introduced strong background noise. The flexibility of uncoupled, single-element induced AE signals in SA-AE was further leveraged to quantify their spatial coherence across the transmit aperture, obtaining maps of the coherence factor (CF) and pulse-length coherence factor (CFPL). Weighting SA-AE images with their derived CF and CFPL maps resulted in further improvement in image resolution and contrast, and notably, boosted the image SNR beyond that of FUS-AE. CFPL exhibited stronger noise suppression over CF. Using unfocused wave transmissions, the proposed coherence-weighted SA-AE strategy offers a high resolution yet noise-robust solution towards the practical imaging of fast biological currents.

Title: Hybrid Iterative Detection for OTFS: Interplay between Local L-MMSE and Global Message Passing
Authors: Ruohai Yang, Shuangyang Li, Han Yu, Zhiqiang Wei, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust solution for high-mobility wireless communications. However, conventional detection algorithms, such as linear equalizers and message passing (MP) methods, either suffer from noise enhancement or fail under complex doubly-selective channels, especially in the presence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we propose a hybrid low-complexity iterative detection framework that combines linear minimum mean square error (L-MMSE) estimation with MP-based probabilistic inference. The key idea is to apply a new delay-Doppler (DD) commutation precoder (DDCP) to the DD domain signal vector, such that the resulting effective channel matrix exhibits a structured form with several locally dense blocks that are sparsely inter-connected. This precoding structure enables a hybrid iterative detection strategy, where a low-dimensional L-MMSE estimation is applied to the dense blocks, while MP is utilized to exploit the sparse inter-block connections. Furthermore, we provide a detailed complexity analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme incurs lower computational cost compared to the full-size L-MMSE detection. The simulation results of convergence performance confirm that the proposed hybrid MP detection achieves fast and reliable convergence with controlled complexity. In terms of error performance, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves significantly better bit error rate (BER) under various channel conditions. Particularly in multipath scenarios, the BER performance of the proposed method closely approaches the matched filter bound (MFB), indicating its near-optimal error performance.

Title: Fast Frequency Response Potential of Data Centers through Workload Modulation and UPS Coordination
Authors: Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh
Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced system inertia and increased the need for fast frequency response (FFR) in modern power systems. Data centers, as large and flexible electrical consumers, hold great potential to contribute to frequency stabilization due to their controllable IT workloads and on-site uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging data centers for providing fast frequency response through real-time workload modulation and UPS coordination. A dynamic model combining data center power consumption and grid frequency dynamics is developed, capturing the interactions between IT servers, cooling systems, and energy storage. Control strategies based on frequency deviation are implemented to adjust server power and discharge UPS batteries during frequency events. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce frequency nadir and shorten recovery time without compromising service quality. The results highlight the promising role of data centers as grid-supporting resources in future low-inertia systems.

Title: Antenna Coding Optimization Based on Pixel Antennas for MIMO Wireless Power Transfer with DC Combining
Authors: Yijun Chen, Shanpu Shen, Tianrui Qiao, Hongyu Li, Jun Qian, Ross Murch
Abstract: This paper investigates antenna coding based on pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Antenna coding is closely related to the Fluid Antenna System (FAS) concept and further generalizes the radiation pattern reconfigurability. We first introduce a beamspace channel model to demonstrate reconfigurable radiation patterns enabled by antenna coders. By jointly optimizing the antenna coding and transmit beamforming with perfect channel state information (CSI), we exploit gains from antenna coding, transmit beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity to maximize the output DC power. We adopt an alternating optimization approach with the quasi-Newton method and Successive Exhaustive Boolean Optimization (SEBO) method with warm-start to handle the transmit beamforming design and antenna coding design respectively. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed MIMO WPT system with pixel antennas achieves up to 15 dB gain in average output DC power compared with a conventional system with fixed antenna configuration, highlighting the potential of pixel antennas for boosting the WPT efficiency.

Title: Coordinated Fast Frequency Response from Electric Vehicles, Data Centers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems
Authors: Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh
Abstract: High renewable penetration has significantly reduced system inertia in modern power grids, increasing the need for fast frequency response (FFR) from distributed and non-traditional resources. While electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have each demonstrated the capability to provide sub-second active power support, their combined frequency response potential has not been systematically evaluated. This paper proposes a coordinated control framework that aggregates these heterogeneous resources to provide fast, stable, and reliable FFR. Dynamic models for EV fleets, data center UPS and workload modulation, and BESS are developed, explicitly capturing their response times, power limits, and operational constraints. A hierarchical control architecture is introduced, where an upper-level coordinator dynamically allocates FFR among resources based on response speed and available capacity, and lower-level controllers implement the actual power response. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the coordinated EV-DC-BESS framework improves frequency nadir by up to 0.2 Hz, reduces RoCoF, and accelerates frequency recovery compared with single-resource FFR. Results confirm that synergistic coordination significantly enhances grid stability, especially in low-inertia scenarios. This work highlights the value of multi-resource aggregation for future frequency regulation markets in renewable-dominated grids.

Title: KalMRACO: Unifying Kalman Filter and Model Reference Adaptive Control for Robust Control and Estimation of Uncertain Systems
Authors: Lauritz Rismark Fosso, Christian Holden, Sveinung Johan Ohrem
Abstract: A common assumption when applying the Kalman filter is a priori knowledge of the system parameters. These parameters are not necessarily known, and this may limit real-world applications of the Kalman filter. The well-established Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) utilizes a known reference model and ensures that the input-output behavior of a potentially unknown system converges to that of the reference model. We present KalMRACO, a unification of the Kalman filter and MRAC leveraging the reference model of MRAC as the Kalman filter system model, thus eliminating, to a large degree, the need for knowledge of the underlying system parameters in the application of the Kalman filter. We also introduce the concept of blending estimated states and measurements in the feedback law to handle stability issues during the initial transient. KalMRACO is validated through simulations and lab trials on an underwater vehicle. Results show superior tracking of the reference model state, observer state convergence, and noise mitigation properties.

Title: Rethinking Gaussian-Windowed Wavelets for Damping Identification
Authors: Hadi M. Daniali, Martin v. Mohrenschildt
Abstract: In modal analysis, the prevalent use of Gaussian-based wavelets (such as Morlet and Gabor) for damping estimation is rarely questioned. In this study, we challenge this conventional approach by systematically exploring envelope-based damping estimators and proposing a data-driven framework that optimizes the shape and parameters of the envelope utilizing synthetic impulse responses with known ground-truth envelopes. The performance of the resulting estimators is benchmarked across a range of scenarios and compared against frequency-domain damping estimation methods, including Least Squares Rational Function (LSRF), poly-reference Least Squares Complex Frequency-Domain (pLSCF), peak picking (PP), and the Yoshida method. Our findings indicate that Triangle and Welch windows consistently outperform or are on par with Gaussian wavelet methods in contexts of moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In contrast, Blackman filtering demonstrates superior robustness under low SNR conditions and scenarios involving closely spaced modes. Among the frequency-domain methods assessed, LSRF shows the most reliability at very low SNR; however, the non-Gaussian optimized envelope estimators perform exceptionally well as the SNR improves.

Title: Graph Signal Denoising Using Regularization by Denoising and Its Parameter Estimation
Authors: Hayate Kojima, Hiroshi Higashi, Yuichi Tanaka
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an interpretable denoising method for graph signals using regularization by denoising (RED). RED is a technique developed for image restoration that uses an efficient (and sometimes black-box) denoiser in the regularization term of the optimization problem. By using RED, optimization problems can be designed with the explicit use of the denoiser, and the gradient of the regularization term can be easily computed under mild conditions. We adapt RED for denoising of graph signals beyond image processing. We show that many graph signal denoisers, including graph neural networks, theoretically or practically satisfy the conditions for RED. We also study the effectiveness of RED from a graph filter perspective. Furthermore, we propose supervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods based on deep algorithm unrolling. These methods aim to enhance the algorithm applicability, particularly in the unsupervised setting. Denoising experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed method improves signal denoising accuracy in mean squared error compared to existing graph signal denoising methods.

Title: Investigating the impact of stereo processing -- a study for extending the Open Dataset of Audio Quality (ODAQ)
Authors: Sascha Dick, Christoph Thompson, Chih-Wei Wu, Pablo Delgado, Phillip A. Williams, Matteo Torcoli
Abstract: In this paper, we present an initial study for extending Open Dataset of Audio Quality (ODAQ) towards the impact of stereo processing. Monaural artifacts from ODAQ were adapted in combinations with left-right (LR) and mid-side (MS) stereo processing, across stimuli including solo instruments, typical wide stereo mixes and and hard-panned mixes. Listening tests in different presentation context -- with and without direct comparison of MS and LR conditions -- were conducted to collect subjective data beyond monaural artifacts while also scrutinizing the listening test methodology. The ODAQ dataset is extended with new material along with subjective scores from 16 expert listeners. The listening test results show substantial influences of the stimuli's spatial characteristics as well as the presentation context. Notably, several significant disparities between LR and MS only occur when presented in direct comparison. The findings suggest that listeners primarily assess timbral impairments when spatial characteristics are consistent and focus on stereo image only when timbral quality is similar. The rating of an additional mono anchor was overall consistent across different stereo characteristics, averaging at 65 on the MUSHRA scale, further corroborating that listeners prioritize timbral over spatial impressions.

Title: Robust Design for Multi-Antenna LEO Satellite Communications with Fractional Delay and Doppler Shifts: An RSMA-OTFS Approach
Authors: Yunnuo Xu, Yumeng Zhang, Yijie Mao, Bruno Clerck, Yun Hee Kim, Yujun Li
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems face challenges due to high satellite mobility, which hinders the reliable acquisition of instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and subsequently degrades multi-user transmission performance. This paper investigates a downlink multi-user multi-antenna system, and tackles the above challenges by introducing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission. Specifically, OTFS enables stable characterization of time-varying channels by representing them in the delay-Doppler domain. However, realistic propagation introduces various inter-symbol and inter-user interference due to non-orthogonal yet practical rectangular pulse shaping, fractional delays, Doppler shifts, and imperfect (statistical) CSIT. In this context, RSMA offers promising robustness for interference mitigation and CSIT imperfections, and hence is integrated with OTFS to provide a comprehensive solution. A compact cross-domain input-output relationship for RSMA-OTFS is established, and an ergodic sum-rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a weighted minimum mean-square-error based alternating optimization algorithm that does not depend on channel sparsity. Simulation results reveal that the considered practical propagation effects significantly degrade performance if unaddressed. Furthermore, the RSMA-OTFS scheme demonstrates improved ergodic sum-rate and robustness against CSIT uncertainty across various user deployments and CSIT qualities.

Title: A Data-Driven Approach for Electric Vehicle Powertrain Modeling
Authors: Eymen Ipek, Mario Hirz
Abstract: Electrification in the automotive industry and increasing powertrain complexity demand accelerated, cost-effective development cycles. While data-driven models are recently investigated at component level, a gap exists in systematically integrating them into cohesive, system-level simulations for virtual validation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a modular framework for developing powertrain simulations. By defining standardized interfaces for key components-the battery, inverter, and electric motor-our methodology enables independently developed models, whether data-driven, physics-based, or empirical, to be easily integrated. This approach facilitates scalable system-level modeling, aims to shorten development timelines and to meet the agile demands of the modern automotive industry.

Title: A Geometric Task-Space Port-Hamiltonian Formulation for Redundant Manipulators
Authors: Federico Califano, Camilla Rota, Riccardo Zanella, Antonio Franchi
Abstract: We present a novel geometric port-Hamiltonian formulation of redundant manipulators performing a differential kinematic task $\eta=J(q)\dot{q}$, where $q$ is a point on the configuration manifold, $\eta$ is a velocity-like task space variable, and $J(q)$ is a linear map representing the task, for example the classical analytic or geometric manipulator Jacobian matrix. The proposed model emerges from a change of coordinates from canonical Hamiltonian dynamics, and splits the standard Hamiltonian momentum variable into a task-space momentum variable and a null-space momentum variable. Properties of this model and relation to Lagrangian formulations present in the literature are highlighted. Finally, we apply the proposed model in an \textit{Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control} (IDA-PBC) design to stabilize and shape the impedance of a 7-DOF Emika Panda robot in simulation.

Title: User Localization and Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Hong Xing, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel user localization and channel estimation framework for pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where pinching antennas are grouped into subarrays on each waveguide to cooperatively estimate user/scatterer locations, thus reconstructing channels. Both single-waveguide (SW) and multi-waveguide (MW) structures are considered. SW consists of multiple alternatingly activated subarrays, while MW deploys one subarray on each waveguide to enable concurrent subarray measurements. For the 2D scenarios with a fixed user/scatter height, an orthogonal matching pursuit-based geometry-consistent localization (OMP-GCL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages inter-subarray geometric relationships and compressed sensing for precise estimation. Theoretical analysis on Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) demonstrates that: 1) The estimation accuracy can be improved by increasing the geometric diversity through multi-subarray deployment; and 2) SW provides a limited geometric diversity within a $180^\circ$ half space and leads to angle ambiguity, while MW enables full-space observations and reduces overheads. The OMP-GCL algorithm is further extended to 3D scenarios, where user and scatter heights are also estimated. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, and verify that MW achieves centimeter- and decimeter-level localization accuracy in 2D and 3D scenarios with only three waveguides.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks promises the integration of radar-like sensing capabilities into communication infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate a multi-static sensing framework where half-duplex base stations (BSs) are assigned as either transmitter or sensing receiver nodes. We propose a randomized sparse resource allocation scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design tailored for the multi-static scenario to simultaneously mitigate inter-BS interference (IBI) and sensing ambiguities. The waveform design also ensures robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) via a judicious choice of subcarrier spacing according to the deployment of BSs. The potential ambiguity caused by sparse signaling is addressed through controlled irregularity in both time and frequency domains, with a negligible noise floor elevation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed design in the presence of multiple targets and clutter.

Title: Pragmatic Earth-Fixed Beam Management for 3GPP NTN Common Signaling in LEO Satellites
Authors: Xavier Artiga, Màrius Caus, Ana Pérez-Neira
Abstract: This work proposes a pragmatic method for the design of beam footprint layouts and beam hopping illumination patterns to efficiently broadcast 3GPP NTN common signaling to large coverage areas using EIRP-limited LEO satellites. This method minimizes the time resources required to sweep over the whole coverage while ensuring that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio received by users is above a given threshold. It discusses the design of: (i) an Earth-fixed grid of beam layouts; (ii) beamforming vectors and beam power allocation; (iii) beam hopping patterns and (iv) space, time and frequency resource allocation of 3GPP common signaling. Two main beam layout solutions are proposed to significantly reduce the number of beams required to illuminate the coverage area: one based on phased array beams with low beam crossover levels and the other on widened beams. A numerical evaluation using practical system parameters showed that both solutions perform similarly, but that the best result is obtained with phased arrays beams with optimized beam cross over levels. Indeed, for the system evaluated, they allowed reducing the total number of beams from 1723 to 451, which combined with a proper beam hopping pattern and scheduling scheme allowed obtaining a coverage ratio of 100% and a common signaling efficiency (i.e. number of slots carrying common signaling over total number of slots) up to 80.6% for the most stringent common signaling periodicity of 20 ms considered by 3GPP.

Title: Terahertz Signal Coverage Enhancement in Hall Scenarios Based on Single-Hop and Dual-Hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Ben Chen, Zhangdui Zhong, Ke Guan, Danping He, Yiran Wang, Jianwen Ding, Qi Luo
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication offers ultra-high data rates and has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless networks. However, the inherently high free-space path loss of THz waves significantly limits the coverage range of THz communication systems. Therefore, extending the effective coverage area is a key challenge for the practical deployment of THz networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation, provide a solution to enhance THz coverage. To investigate multi-RIS deployment scenarios, this work integrates an antenna array-based RIS model into the ray-tracing simulation platform. Using an indoor hall as a representative case study, the enhancement effects of single-hop and dual-hop RIS configurations on indoor signal coverage are evaluated under various deployment schemes. The developed framework offers valuable insights and design references for optimizing RIS-assisted indoor THz communication and coverage estimation.

Title: Equivariant Filter Cascade for Relative Attitude, Target's Angular Velocity, and Gyroscope Bias Estimation
Authors: Gil Serrano, Pedro Lourenço, Bruno J. Guerreiro, Rita Cunha
Abstract: Rendezvous and docking between a chaser spacecraft and an uncooperative target, such as an inoperative satellite, require synchronization between the chaser spacecraft and the target. In these scenarios, the chaser must estimate the relative attitude and angular velocity of the target using onboard sensors, in the presence of gyroscope bias. In this work, we propose a cascade of Equivariant Filters (EqF) to address this problem. The first stage of the cascade estimates the chaser's attitude and the bias, using measurements from a star tracker, while the second stage of the cascade estimates the relative attitude and the target's angular velocity, using observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. The stability of the EqF cascade is theoretically analyzed and simulation results demonstrate the filter cascade's performance.

Title: Quadratic Kalman Filter for Elliptical Extended Object Tracking based on Decoupling State Components
Authors: Simon Steuernagel, Marcus Baum
Abstract: Extended object tracking involves estimating both the physical extent and kinematic parameters of a target object, where typically multiple measurements are observed per time step. In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.

Title: Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation Based Joint Communication and Radar for Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Zhuoran Li, Zhen Gao, Sheng Chen, Dusit Niyato, Zhaocheng Wan, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles. We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions. Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance. We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems. Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions. Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

Title: Relaying Signal When Monitoring Traffic: Double Use of Aerial Vehicles Towards Intelligent Low-Altitude Networking
Authors: Jiahui Liang, Wenlihan Lu, Tianyi Liu, Kang Kang, Guixin Pan, Liuqing Yang, Xinhu Zheng, Shijian Gao
Abstract: In intelligent low-altitude networks, integrating monitoring tasks into communication unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can consume resources and increase handoff latency for communication links. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy that enables a "double use" of UAVs, unifying the monitoring and relay handoff functions into a single, efficient process. Our scheme, guided by an integrated sensing and communication framework, coordinates these multi-role UAVs through a proactive handoff network that fuses multi-view sensory data from aerial and ground vehicles. A lightweight vehicle inspection module and a two-stage training procedure are developed to ensure monitoring accuracy and collaborative efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach: it reduces communication outage probability by nearly 10% at a 200 Mbps requirement without compromising monitoring performance and maintains high resilience (86% achievable rate) even in the absence of multiple UAVs, outperforming traditional ground-based handoff schemes. Our code is available at the this https URL.

Title: Nonlinear System Identification Nano-drone Benchmark
Authors: Riccardo Busetto, Elia Cereda, Marco Forgione, Gabriele Maroni, Dario Piga, Daniele Palossi
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for system identification based on 75k real-world samples from the Crazyflie 2.1 Brushless nano-quadrotor, a sub-50g aerial vehicle widely adopted in robotics research. The platform presents a challenging testbed due to its multi-input, multi-output nature, open-loop instability, and nonlinear dynamics under agile maneuvers. The dataset comprises four aggressive trajectories with synchronized 4-dimensional motor inputs and 13-dimensional output measurements. To enable fair comparison of identification methods, the benchmark includes a suite of multi-horizon prediction metrics for evaluating both one-step and multi-step error propagation. In addition to the data, we provide a detailed description of the platform and experimental setup, as well as baseline models highlighting the challenge of accurate prediction under real-world noise and actuation nonlinearities. All data, scripts, and reference implementations are released as open-source at this https URL to facilitate transparent comparison of algorithms and support research on agile, miniaturized aerial robotics.

Title: Equivariant Observer for Bearing Estimation with Linear and Angular Velocity Inputs
Authors: Gil Serrano, Marcelo Jacinto, Bruno J. Guerreiro, Rita Cunha
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of designing an equivariant observer for a first order dynamical system on the unit-sphere. Building upon the established case of unit bearing vector dynamics with angular velocity inputs, we introduce an additional linear velocity input projected onto the unit-sphere tangent space. This extended formulation is particularly useful in image-based visual servoing scenarios where stable bearing estimates are required and the relative velocity between the vehicle and target features must be accounted for. Leveraging lifted kinematics to the Special Orthogonal group, we design an observer for the bearing vector and prove its almost global asymptotic stability. Additionally, we demonstrate how the equivariant observer can be expressed in the original state manifold. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework
Authors: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.

Title: Closed-Loop Consistent, Causal Data-Driven Predictive Control via SSARX
Authors: Aihui Liu, Magnus Jansson
Abstract: We propose a fundamental-lemma-free data-driven predictive control (DDPC) scheme for synthesizing model predictive control (MPC)-like policies directly from input-output data. Unlike the well-known DeePC approach and other DDPC methods that rely on Willems' fundamental lemma, our method avoids stacked Hankel representations and the DeePC decision variable g. Instead, we develop a closed-loop consistent, causal DDPC scheme based on the multi-step predictor Subspace-ARX (SSARX). The method first (i) estimates predictor/observer Markov parameters via a high-order ARX model to decouple the noise, then (ii) learns a multi-step past-to-future map by regression, optionally with a reduced-rank constraint. The SSARX predictor is strictly causal, which allows it to be integrated naturally into an MPC formulation. Our experimental results show that SSARX performs competitively with other methods when applied to closed-loop data affected by measurement and process noise.

Title: Scalable Nonlinear DeePC: Bridging Direct and Indirect Methods and Basis Reduction
Authors: Thomas O. de Jong, Mircea Lazar, Siep Weiland, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: This paper studies regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) within a nonlinear framework and its relationship to subspace predictive control (SPC). The $\Pi$-regularization is extended to general basis functions and it is shown that, under suitable conditions, the resulting basis functions DeePC formulation constitutes a relaxation of basis functions SPC. To improve scalability, we introduce an SVD-based dimensionality reduction that preserves the equivalence with SPC, and we derive a reduced {\Pi}-regularization. A LASSO based sparse basis selection method is proposed to obtain a reduced basis from lifted data. Simulations on a nonlinear van der Pol oscillator model indicate that, in the absence of noise, DeePC and SPC yield equivalent absolute mean tracking errors (AMEs) when large penalties are applied. In contrast, under noisy measurements, careful tuning of the DeePC regularization results in a reduced AME, outperforming SPC.

Title: Test Time Optimized Generalized AI-based Medical Image Registration Method
Authors: Sneha Sree C., Dattesh Shanbhag, Sudhanya Chatterjee
Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for aligning anatomical structures across imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. Among existing techniques, non-rigid registration (NRR) is particularly challenging due to the need to capture complex anatomical deformations caused by physiological processes like respiration or contrast-induced signal variations. Traditional NRR methods, while theoretically robust, often require extensive parameter tuning and incur high computational costs, limiting their use in real-time clinical workflows. Recent deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise; however, their dependence on task-specific retraining restricts scalability and adaptability in practice. These limitations underscore the need for efficient, generalizable registration frameworks capable of handling heterogeneous imaging contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for 3D non-rigid registration that generalizes across multiple imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Unlike conventional methods that rely on application-specific models, our approach eliminates anatomy- or modality-specific customization, enabling streamlined integration into diverse clinical environments.

Title: Fusion of Cellular ISAC and Passive RF Sensing for UAV Detection and Tracking
Authors: Cole Dickerson, Sean Kearney, Sultan Manjur, Ismail Guvenc, Sevgi Gurbuz, Ali Gurbuz, Ozgur Ozdemir, Mihail Sichitiu
Abstract: The rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian and critical-infrastructure airspace has created a need for reliable detection and tracking systems that operate under diverse environmental and sensing conditions. This paper presents a UAV detection and tracking system that fuses measurements from a network of passive Keysight N6841A RF sensors and a Ku-band Fortem TrueView R20 radar operating in the FR3 spectrum (16.3 GHz) as an ISAC proxy. Real-world experiments at the NSF AERPAW testbed demonstrate that radar and RF sensing provide complementary strengths under varying geometric, range, and line-of-sight conditions. A Kalman filter using a constant-velocity motion model integrates the asynchronous 2D RF and 3D radar observations, suppressing large standalone errors, improving accuracy over individual modalities, and increasing tracking coverage without degrading performance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal, ISAC-oriented sensing for robust UAV tracking in outdoor environments.

Title: Tunable Gaussian Pulse for Delay-Doppler ISAC
Authors: Bruno Felipe Costa, Anup Mishra, Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Taufik Abrão, Petar Popovski
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for next-generation networks targets robust operation under high mobility and high Doppler spread, leading to severe inter-carrier interference (ICI) in systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. Delay--Doppler (DD)-domain ISAC offers a more robust foundation under high mobility, but it requires a suitable DD-domain pulse-shaping filter. The prevailing DD pulse designs are either communication-centric or static, which limits adaptation to non-stationary channels and diverse application demands. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the tunable Gaussian pulse (TGP), a DD-native, analytically tunable pulse shape parameterized by its aspect ratio \( \gamma \), chirp rate \( \alpha_c \), and phase coupling \( \beta_c \). On the sensing side, we derive closed-form Cramér--Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) that map \( (\gamma,\alpha_c,\beta_c) \) to fundamental delay and Doppler precision. On the communications side, we show that \( \alpha_c \) and \( \beta_c \) reshape off-diagonal covariance, and thus inter-symbol interference (ISI), without changing received power, isolating capacity effects to interference structure rather than power loss. A comprehensive trade-off analysis demonstrates that the TGP spans a flexible operational region from the high capacity of the Sinc pulse to the high precision of the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse. Notably, TGP attains near-RRC sensing precision while retaining over \( 90\% \) of Sinc's maximum capacity, achieving a balanced operating region that is not attainable by conventional static pulse designs.

Title: An Energy-Efficient Adiabatic Capacitive Neural Network Chip
Authors: Himadri Singh Raghav, Sachin Maheshwari, Mike Smart, Patrick Foster, Alex Serb
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, coupled with increasing data bandwidth requirements, in applications such as video processing and high-resolution sensing, have created a growing demand for high computational performance under stringent energy constraints, especially for battery-powered and edge devices. To address this, we present a mixed-signal adiabatic capacitive neural network chip, designed in a 130$nm$ CMOS technology, to demonstrate significant energy savings coupled with high image classification accuracy. Our dual-layer hardware chip, incorporating 16 single-cycle multiply-accumulate engines, can reliably distinguish between 4 classes of 8x8 1-bit images, with classification results over 95\%, within 2.7\% of an equivalent software version. Energy measurements reveal average energy savings between 2.1x and 6.8x, compared to an equivalent CMOS capacitive implementation.

Title: Segmental Attention Decoding With Long Form Acoustic Encodings
Authors: Pawel Swietojanski, Xinwei Li, Mingbin Xu, Takaaki Hori, Dogan Can, Xiaodan Zhuang
Abstract: We address the fundamental incompatibility of attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models with long-form acoustic encodings. AED models trained on segmented utterances learn to encode absolute frame positions by exploiting limited acoustic context beyond segment boundaries, but fail to generalize when decoding long-form segments where these cues vanish. The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments. We show these modifications close the accuracy gap between continuous and segmented acoustic encodings, enabling auto-regressive use of the attention decoder.

Title: Configurable γ Photon Spectrometer to Enable Precision Radioguided Tumor Resection
Authors: Rahul Lall, Youngho Seo, Ali M. Niknejad, Mekhail Anwar
Abstract: Surgical tumor resection aims to remove all cancer cells in the tumor margin and at centimeter-scale depths below the tissue surface. During surgery, microscopic clusters of disease are intraoperatively difficult to visualize and are often left behind, significantly increasing the risk of cancer recurrence. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has shown the ability to selectively tag cancer cells with gamma ({\gamma}) photon emitting radioisotopes to identify them, but require a mm-scale {\gamma} photon spectrometer to localize the position of these cells in the tissue margin (i.e., a function of incident {\gamma} photon energy) with high specificity. Here we present a 9.9 mm2 integrated circuit (IC)-based {\gamma} spectrometer implemented in 180 nm CMOS, to enable the measurement of single {\gamma} photons and their incident energy with sub-keV energy resolution. We use small 2 2 um reverse-biased diodes that have low depletion region capacitance, and therefore produce millivolt-scale voltage signals in response to the small charge generated by incident {\gamma} photons. A low-power energy spectrometry method is implemented by measuring the decay time it takes for the generated voltage signal to settle back to DC after a {\gamma} detection event, instead of measuring the voltage drop directly. This spectrometry method is implemented in three different pixel architectures that allow for configurable pixel sensitivity, energy-resolution, and energy dynamic range based on the widely heterogenous surgical and patient presentation in RGS. The spectrometer was tested with three common {\gamma}-emitting radioisotopes (64Cu, 133Ba, 177Lu), and is able to resolve activities down to 1 uCi with sub-keV energy resolution and 1.315 MeV energy dynamic range, using 5-minute acquisitions.

Title: Cryptographic transformations over polyadic rings
Authors: Steven Duplij, Na Fu, Qiang Guo
Abstract: This article introduces a novel cryptographic paradigm based on nonderived polyadic algebraic structures. Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $\Phi(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the "quantized" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols.

Title: Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Resource Management in O-RAN
Authors: Fatemeh Lotfi, Fatemeh Afghah
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern applications demands wireless networks capable of real time adaptability and efficient resource management. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.

Title: Time-aware UNet and super-resolution deep residual networks for spatial downscaling
Authors: Mika Sipilä, Sabrina Maggio, Sandra De Iaco, Klaus Nordhausen, Monica Palma, Sara Taskinen
Abstract: Satellite data of atmospheric pollutants are often available only at coarse spatial resolution, limiting their applicability in local-scale environmental analysis and decision-making. Spatial downscaling methods aim to transform the coarse satellite data into high-resolution fields. In this work, two widely used deep learning architectures, the super-resolution deep residual network (SRDRN) and the encoder-decoder-based UNet, are considered for spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone. Both methods are extended with a lightweight temporal module, which encodes observation time using either sinusoidal or radial basis function (RBF) encoding, and fuses the temporal features with the spatial representations in the networks. The proposed time-aware extensions are evaluated against their baseline counterparts in a case study on ozone downscaling over Italy. The results suggest that, while only slightly increasing computational complexity, the temporal modules significantly improve downscaling performance and convergence speed.

Title: Group-Theoretic Reinforcement Learning of Dynamical Decoupling Sequences
Authors: Charles Marrder, Shuo Sun, Murray J. Holland
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling seeks to mitigate phase decoherence in qubits by applying a carefully designed sequence of effectively instantaneous electromagnetic pulses. Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.

Title: Symbol Distributions in Semantic Communications: A Source-Channel Equilibrium Perspective
Authors: Hanju Yoo, Dongha Choi, Songkuk Kim, Chan-Byoung Chae, Robert W. Heath Jr
Abstract: Semantic communication systems often use an end-to-end neural network to map input data into continuous symbols. These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis.

Title: ACE-SLAM: Scene Coordinate Regression for Neural Implicit Real-Time SLAM
Authors: Ignacio Alzugaray, Marwan Taher, Andrew J. Davison
Abstract: We present a novel neural RGB-D Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system that learns an implicit map of the scene in real time. For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM. Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art. Project Page: this https URL

Title: Quality-Aware Framework for Video-Derived Respiratory Signals
Authors: Nhi Nguyen, Constantino Álvarez Casado, Le Nguyen, Manuel Lage Cañellas, Miguel Bordallo López
Abstract: Video-based respiratory rate (RR) estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across extraction methods. We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quality-driven predictive modeling to deliver scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring solutions.

Title: Robust Beamforming for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Unknown Channel Statistics: A Hybrid Offline-Online Framework
Authors: Wenzhuo Zou, Ming-Min Zhao, An Liu, Min-Jian Zhao
Abstract: Robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, particularly when the channel estimation error statistics are unknown. Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Title: Trajectory Tracking for Multi-Manipulator Systems in Constrained Environments
Authors: Mayank Sewlia, Christos K. Verginis, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.

Title: LegionITS: A Federated Intrusion-Tolerant System Architecture
Authors: Tadeu Freitas, Carlos Novo, Manuel E. Correia, Rolando Martins
Abstract: The growing sophistication, frequency, and diversity of cyberattacks increasingly exceed the capacity of individual entities to fully understand and counter them. While existing solutions, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms, and Security Operation Center (SOC), play a vital role in mitigating known threats, they often struggle to effectively address emerging and unforeseen attacks. To increase the effectiveness of cyber defense, it is essential to foster greater information sharing between entities; however, this requires addressing the challenge of exchanging sensitive data without compromising confidentiality or operational security. To address the challenges of secure and confidential Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing, we propose a novel architecture that federates Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) and leverages concepts from Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) to empower SOCs. This framework enables controlled collaboration and data privacy while enhancing collective defenses. As a proof of concept, we evaluate one module by applying Differential Privacy (DP) to Federated Learning (FL), observing a manageable accuracy drop from 98.42% to 85.98% (average loss 12.44%) while maintaining reliable detection of compromised messages. These results highlight the viability of secure data sharing and establishes a foundation for the future full-scale implementation of LegionITS.

Abstract: The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.

Title: PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion
Authors: Huizheng Wang, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin
Abstract: Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency. This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria. We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.

Title: Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Henrik Hose, Paul Brunzema, Alexander von Rohr, Alexander Gräfe, Angela P. Schoellig, Sebastian Trimpe
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.

Title: Temporal interference stimulation for deep brain neuromodulation in humans
Authors: Pierre Vassiliadis, Elena Beanato, Maximilian J. Wessel, Friedhelm C. Hummel
Abstract: For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment.

Title: Agile Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing
Authors: Yewen Cao, Yulin Shao
Abstract: The advancement to 6G calls for waveforms that transcend static robustness to achieve intelligent adaptability. Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), despite its strength in doubly-dispersive channels, has been confined by chirp parameters optimized for worst-case scenarios. This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM. Agile-AFDM, therefore, offers a crucial step forward in the design of agile waveforms for 6G and beyond.

Title: AnySleep: a channel-agnostic deep learning system for high-resolution sleep staging in multi-center cohorts
Authors: Niklas Grieger, Jannik Raskob, Siamak Mehrkanoon, Stephan Bialonski
Abstract: Sleep is essential for good health throughout our lives, yet studying its dynamics requires manual sleep staging, a labor-intensive step in sleep research and clinical care. Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring. We make the model publicly available to facilitate large-scale studies with heterogeneous electrode setups and to accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers in sleep.

Title: Linguists should learn to love speech-based deep learning models
Authors: Marianne de Heer Kloots, Paul Boersma, Willem Zuidema
Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

Title: The Innovation Null Space of the Kalman Predictor: A Stochastic Perspective for DeePC
Authors: Aihui Liu, Magnus Jansson
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma uses a key decision variable $g$ to combine measured input-output data and describe trajectories of a linear time-invariant system. In this paper, we ask: what is a good choice for this vector $g$ when the system is affected by noise? For a linear system with Gaussian noise, we show that there exists an optimal subspace for this decision variable $g$, which is the null space of the innovation Hankel matrix. If the decision vector lies in this null space, the resulting predictor gets closer to the Kalman predictor. To show this, we use a result that we refer to as the Kalman Filter Fundamental Lemma (KFFL), which applies Willems' lemma to the Kalman predictor. This viewpoint also explains several existing data-driven predictive control methods: regularized DeePC schemes act as soft versions of the innovation null-space constraint, instrumental-variable methods enforce it by construction, and ARX-based approaches explicitly estimate this innovation null space.

Title: Synthetic Electrogram Generation with Variational Autoencoders for ECGI
Authors: Miriam Gutiérrez Fernández, Karen López-Linares, Carlos Fambuena Santos, María S. Guillem, Andreu M. Climent, Óscar Barquero Pérez
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its clinical assessment requires accurate characterization of atrial electrical activity. Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.

Title: Adaptable Segmentation Pipeline for Diverse Brain Tumors with Radiomic-guided Subtyping and Lesion-Wise Model Ensemble
Authors: Daniel Capellán-Martín, Abhijeet Parida, Zhifan Jiang, Nishad Kulkarni, Krithika Iyer, Austin Tapp, Syed Muhammad Anwar, María J. Ledesma-Carbayo, Marius George Linguraru
Abstract: Robust and generalizable segmentation of brain tumors on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains difficult because tumor types differ widely. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.

Title: gridfm-datakit-v1: A Python Library for Scalable and Realistic Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow Data Generation
Authors: Alban Puech, Matteo Mazzonelli, Celia Cintas, Tamara R. Govindasamy, Mangaliso Mngomezulu, Jonas Weiss, Matteo Baù, Anna Varbella, François Mirallès, Kibaek Kim, Le Xie, Hendrik F. Hamann, Etienne Vos, Thomas Brunschwiler
Abstract: We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\Delta$ are provided. Available on GitHub at this https URL under Apache 2.0 and via `pip install gridfm-datakit`.

Title: Enhancing Orbital Debris Remediation with Reconfigurable Space-Based Laser Constellations
Authors: David O. Williams Rogers, Hang Woon Lee
Abstract: Orbital debris poses an escalating threat to space missions and the long-term sustainability of Earth's orbital environment. The literature proposes various approaches for orbital debris remediation, including the use of multiple space-based lasers that collaboratively engage debris targets. While the proof of concept for this laser-based approach has been demonstrated, critical questions remain about its scalability and responsiveness as the debris population continues to expand rapidly. This paper introduces constellation reconfiguration as a system-level strategy to address these limitations. Through coordinated orbital maneuvers, laser-equipped satellites can dynamically adapt their positions to respond to evolving debris distributions and time-critical events. We formalize this concept as the Reconfigurable Laser-to-Debris Engagement Scheduling Problem (R-L2D-ESP), an optimization framework that determines the optimal sequence of constellation reconfigurations and laser engagements to maximize debris remediation capacity, which quantifies the constellation's ability to nudge, deorbit, or perform just-in-time collision avoidance maneuvers on debris objects. To manage the complexity of this combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a receding horizon approach. Our experiments reveal that reconfigurable constellations significantly outperform static ones, achieving greater debris remediation capacity and successfully deorbiting substantially more debris objects. Additionally, our sensitivity analyses identify the key parameters that influence remediation performance the most, providing essential insights for future system design. These findings demonstrate that constellation reconfiguration represents a promising advancement for laser-based debris removal systems, offering the adaptability and scalability necessary to enhance this particular approach to orbital debris remediation.

Title: Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization
Authors: Yen-Ju Lu, Kunxiao Gao, Mingrui Liang, Helin Wang, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak, Jesus Villalba
Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at this https URL. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

Title: Spherical Leech Quantization for Visual Tokenization and Generation
Authors: Yue Zhao, Hanwen Jiang, Zhenlin Xu, Chutong Yang, Ehsan Adeli, Philipp Krähenbühl
Abstract: Non-parametric quantization has received much attention due to its efficiency on parameters and scalability to a large codebook. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding. The geometry of lattice codes explains the necessity of auxiliary loss terms when training auto-encoders with certain existing lookup-free quantization variants such as BSQ. As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($\Lambda_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits. The improvement also extends to state-of-the-art auto-regressive image generation frameworks.

Title: Joint Network Topology Inference in the Presence of Hidden Nodes
Authors: Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Andrei Buciulea, Antonio G. Marques, Santiago Segarra
Abstract: We investigate the increasingly prominent task of jointly inferring multiple networks from nodal observations. While most joint inference methods assume that observations are available at all nodes, we consider the realistic and more difficult scenario where a subset of nodes are hidden and cannot be measured. Under the assumptions that the partially observed nodal signals are graph stationary and the networks have similar connectivity patterns, we derive structural characteristics of the connectivity between hidden and observed nodes. This allows us to formulate an optimization problem for estimating networks while accounting for the influence of hidden nodes. We identify conditions under which a convex relaxation yields the sparsest solution, and we formalize the performance of our proposed optimization problem with respect to the effect of the hidden nodes. Finally, synthetic and real-world simulations provide evaluations of our method in comparison with other baselines.

Title: Translating Electrocardiograms to Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Useful for Cardiac Assessment and Disease Screening: A Multi-Center Study
Authors: Zhengyao Ding, Ziyu Li, Yujian Hu, Youyao Xu, Chengchen Zhao, Yiheng Mao, Haitao Li, Zhikang Li, Qian Li, Jing Wang, Yue Chen, Mengjia Chen, Longbo Wang, Xuesen Chu, Weichao Pan, Ziyi Liu, Fei Wu, Hongkun Zhang, Ting Chen, Zhengxing Huang
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.

Title: Semantic Communication Meets Heterogeneous Network: Emerging Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges
Authors: Guhan Zheng, Qiang Ni, Aryan Kaushik, Lixia Yang, Yushi Wang, Charilaos Zarakovitis
Abstract: Recent developments in machine learning (ML) techniques enable users to extract, transmit, and reproduce information semantics via ML-based semantic communication (SemCom). This significantly increases network spectral efficiency and transmission robustness. In the network, the semantic encoders and decoders among various users, based on ML, however, require collaborative updating according to new transmission tasks. The various heterogeneous characteristics of most networks in turn introduce emerging but unique challenges for semantic codec updating that are different from other general ML model updating. In this article, we first overview the key components of the SemCom system. We then discuss the unique challenges associated with semantic codec updates in heterogeneous networks. Accordingly, we point out a potential framework and discuss the pros and cons thereof. Finally, several future research directions are also discussed.

Title: Multimodal Deep Learning for Stroke Prediction and Detection using Retinal Imaging and Clinical Data
Authors: Saeed Shurrab, Aadim Nepal, Terrence J. Lee-St. John, Nicola G. Ghazi, Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, Farah E. Shamout
Abstract: Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes.

Title: Optimal Satellite Maneuvers for Spaceborne Jamming Attacks
Authors: Filippos Fotiadis, Quentin Rommel, Brian M. Sadler, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Satellites are becoming exceedingly critical for communication, making them prime targets for cyber-physical attacks. We consider a rogue satellite in low Earth orbit that jams the uplink communication between another satellite and a ground station. To achieve maximal interference with minimal fuel consumption, the jammer carefully maneuvers itself relative to the target satellite's antenna. We cast this maneuvering objective as a two-stage optimal control problem, involving i) repositioning to an efficient jamming position before uplink communication commences; and ii) maintaining an efficient jamming position after communication has started. We obtain the optimal maneuvering trajectories for the jammer and perform simulations to show how they enable the disruption of uplink communication with reasonable fuel consumption.

Title: High Volume Rate 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction with Diffusion Models
Authors: Tristan S.W. Stevens, Oisín Nolan, Oudom Somphone, Jean-Luc Robert, Ruud J.G. van Sloun
Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image quality. One compromise is to retain focus in elevation while leveraging unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full 3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a 3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic anomalies under strong subsampling.

Title: Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing for RGB Image Using Weighted Nucleus Sparsity and Total Variation Regularization
Authors: Nanxin Gong, Saori Takeyama, Masahiro Yamaguchi, Takumi Urata, Fumikazu Kimura, Keiko Ishii
Abstract: The Papanicolaou stain, consisting of five dyes, provides extensive color information essential for cervical cancer cytological screening. The visual observation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. Direct RGB quantification is unreliable because RGB intensities vary with staining and imaging conditions. Stain unmixing offers a promising alternative by quantifying dye amounts. In previous work, multispectral imaging was utilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain. However, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the number of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel training-free Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images. This model enforces (i) nonnegativity, (ii) weighted nucleus sparsity for hematoxylin, and (iii) total variation smoothness, resulting in a convex optimization problem. Our method achieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against the results of multispectral imaging. We further used it to distinguish cells in lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a precancerous gastric-type adenocarcinoma lesion, from normal endocervical cells. Stain abundance features clearly separated the two groups, and a classifier based on stain abundance achieved 98.0% accuracy. By converting subjective color impressions into numerical markers, this technique highlights the strong promise of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.

Title: Data-driven Implementations of Various Generalizations of Balanced Truncation
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar, Qiu-Yan Song, Zhi-Hua Xiao, Victor Sreeram
Abstract: There exist two main approaches for non-intrusive implementations of approximate balanced truncation within the Loewner framework: the quadrature-based method [1] and the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI)-based method [2]. Both approaches rely solely on samples of the transfer function to construct truncated balanced models, eliminating the need for access to the original model's statespace realization. Recently, the quadrature-based approach has been extended to various generalizations of balanced truncation, including positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real balanced truncation, and balanced stochastic truncation. While this extension [3] is theoretically non-intrusive-meaning it does not require the original state-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the transfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are currently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical contribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for these generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the original transfer function for implementation.

Title: Pronunciation-Lexicon Free Training for Phoneme-based Crosslingual ASR via Joint Stochastic Approximation
Authors: Saierdaer Yusuyin, Te Ma, Hao Huang, Zhijian Ou
Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model. To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Furthermore, we propose marginal likelihood scoring (MLS) decoding to align inference with the training objective and P2G augmentation to improve the robustness of P2G mapping. Based on the Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5% error rate reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG training code and complete pipeline.

Title: Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Sehyun Ryu, Hyun Jong Yang
Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS), which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

Title: The Phantom of Davis-Wielandt Shell: A Unified Framework for Graphical Stability Analysis of MIMO LTI Systems
Authors: Ding Zhang, Xiaokan Yang, Axel Ringh, Li Qiu
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell for graphical stability analysis of multi-input and multi-output linear time-invariant feedback systems. Connections between DW shells and various graphical representations, as well as gain and phase measures, are established through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we map the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation conditions. A rotated scaled relative graph ($\theta$-SRG) concept is proposed as a mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops. We also propose a reliable and generalizable algorithm for visualizing the $\theta$-SRGs and include a system example to demonstrate the reduced conservatism of the proposed condition.

Abstract: Cooperative localization is considered a key solution for enabling autonomous navigation of multi-vehicle systems (MVS) in GNSS-denied environments. Among all solutions, distributed cooperative localization (DCL) has garnered widespread attention due to its robustness and scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale MVS. To address the challenge of untrackable state correlations between vehicles in a distributed framework, covariance intersection (CI) has been introduced as a means to fuse relative measurements under unknown correlations. However, existing studies treat CI merely as a plug-in method, applying traditional optimization criteria directly and focusing only on simple two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. When directly extended to three-dimensional (3D) scenarios with more complex state space (higher dimensions, additional state components, and significant disparities in scale and observability among state components), traditional methods fail to achieve balanced state estimation across all state components, leading to a significant degradation in the estimation accuracy of some state components. This highlights the need to design specialized mechanisms to improve the data fusion process. In this paper, we introduce a weighting mechanism, namely the weighted covariance intersection (WCI), to regulate the fusion process of CI. A concurrent fusion strategy for multiple distance measurements and a dedicated weighting matrix based on the error propagation rule of the inertial navigation system (INS) are developed for the data fusion process in DCL. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed WCI significantly enhances cooperative localization performance compared to traditional CI, while the distributed approach outperforms the centralized approach in terms of robustness and scalability.

Title: Towards Automated EEG-Based Epilepsy Detection Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders
Authors: Annika Stiehl, Nicolas Weeger, Christian Uhl, Dominic Bechtold, Nicole Ille, Stefan Geißelsöder
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured when time series signals are used as input.

Title: Data-fused MPC with Guarantees: Application to Flying Humanoid Robots
Authors: Davide Gorbani, Mohamed Elobaid, Giuseppe L'Erario, Hosameldin Awadalla Omer Mohamed, Daniele Pucci
Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown dynamics. Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.

Title: Adversarial Pursuits in Cislunar Space
Authors: Filippos Fotiadis, Quentin Rommel, Gregory Falco, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Cislunar space is becoming a critical domain for future lunar and interplanetary missions, yet its remoteness, sparse infrastructure, and unstable dynamics create single points of failure. Adversaries in cislunar orbits can exploit these vulnerabilities to pursue and jam co-located communication relays, potentially severing communications between lunar missions and the Earth. We study a pursuit-evasion scenario between two spacecraft in a cislunar orbit, where the evader must avoid a pursuer-jammer while remaining close to its nominal trajectory. We model the evader-pursuer interaction as a zero-sum adversarial differential game cast in the circular restricted three-body problem. This formulation incorporates critical aspects of cislunar orbital dynamics, including autonomous adjustment of the reference orbit phasing to enable aggressive evading maneuvers, and shaping of the evader's cost with the orbit's stable and unstable manifolds. We solve the resulting nonlinear game locally using a continuous-time differential dynamic programming variant, which iteratively applies linear-quadratic approximations to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. We simulate the evader's behavior against both a worst-case and a linear-quadratic pursuer. Our results pave the way for securing future missions in cislunar space against emerging cyber threats.

Title: Geometry-Based Drift Compensation for Distributed Channel Sounding Measurements in Dynamic Drone Scenarios
Authors: Lorenz Mohr, Marc Miranda, Sebastian Semper, Julia Beuster, Carsten Andrich, Sebastian Giehl, Christian Schneider, Reiner S. Thomä
Abstract: Measured impulse responses obtained from a dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) channel sounding system exhibit effects attributable to time-varying carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling frequency offset (SFO). To correct the recorded data in post-processing, we extend existing geometry-based drift compensation algorithms by an explicit line-of-sight (LoS) determination, combining a symbol-wise high-resolution parameter estimation (HRPE) in delay with a Kalman filter. This proposed extension facilitates the removal of rapidly varying synchronization mismatches from channel sounding measurements in rich multipath propagation scenarios. Furthermore, we propose using the relative residual power after subtraction of estimated multipath components as a metric for ground-truth-independent comparison of post-processing synchronization methods for recorded channel sounding data. The application of the proposed procedure shows that our approach outperforms existing post-processing compensation algorithms, reducing the relative residual power by more than 5 dB and the delay-Doppler estimate root mean square errors (RMSEs) of a passive UAV target by approximately 60 %.

Title: TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Johannes Kiechle, Stefan M. Fischer, Daniel M. Lang, Cosmin I. Bercea, Matthew J. Nyflot, Lina Felsner, Julia A. Schnabel, Jan C. Peeken
Abstract: The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at this http URL and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at this https URL.

Title: On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices
Authors: Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez
Abstract: Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.

Title: WaveC2R: Wavelet-Driven Coarse-to-Refined Hierarchical Learning for Radar Retrieval
Authors: Chunlei Shi, Han Xu, Yinghao Li, Yi-Lin Wei, Yongchao Feng, Yecheng Zhang, Dan Niu
Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.

Title: Learning Robust and Correct Controllers Guided by Feasibility-Aware Signal Temporal Logic via BarrierNet
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wenliang Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enforcing safety in optimization-based controllers, and their integration with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has enabled the specification-driven synthesis of complex robotic behaviors. However, existing CBF-STL approaches typically rely on fixed hyperparameters and myopic, per-time step optimization, which can lead to overly conservative behavior, infeasibility near tight input limits, and difficulty satisfying long-horizon STL tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a feasibility-aware learning framework that embeds trainable, time-varying High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) into a differentiable Quadratic Program (dQP). Our approach provides a systematic procedure for constructing time-varying HOCBF constraints for a broad fragment of STL and introduces a unified robustness measure that jointly captures STL satisfaction, QP feasibility, and control-bound compliance. Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments.

Title: Secure Wireless Communication Using Coherent Distributed Transmission and Spatial Signal Decomposition
Authors: Anton Schlegel, Jason M/ Merlo, Samuel Wagner, John B. Lancaster, Jeffrey A. Nanzer
Abstract: We present a new approach to secure wireless communications using coherent distributed transmission of signals that are spatially decomposed between a two-element distributed antenna array. High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured.

Title: Competent Discrete Time Modeling For analogue controlled PWM Converter Considering State-Feedback
Authors: Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Hourong Song, Branislav Hredzak, Yingyi Yan
Abstract: Ever since this http URL proposed the state space averaging notion. The small signal model has been widely used as a design tool to tune control parameters. As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted. However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result this http URL.

Title: Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Building Energy Management System
Authors: Huiliang Zhang, Di Wu, Arnaud Zinflou, Benoit Boulet
Abstract: The building sector is one of the largest contributors to global energy consumption. Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.

Title: Med3DVLM: An Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Image Analysis
Authors: Yu Xin, Gorkem Can Ates, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image analysis, but extending them to 3D remains challenging due to the high computational demands of volumetric data and the difficulty of aligning 3D spatial features with clinical text. We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%). In open-ended visual question answering (VQA), it scores 36.76% METEOR (vs. 33.58%), and in closed-ended VQA, it achieves 79.95% accuracy (vs. 75.78%). These results highlight Med3DVLM's ability to bridge the gap between 3D imaging and language, enabling scalable, multi-task reasoning across clinical applications.

Title: Closing the Loop: Motion Prediction Models beyond Open-Loop Benchmarks
Authors: Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi, Christian Schlauch, Nicole Scheuerer, Yue Yao, Nadja Klein, Daniel Göhring, Jörg Reichardt
Abstract: Fueled by motion prediction competitions and benchmarks, recent years have seen the emergence of increasingly large learning based prediction models, many with millions of parameters, focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy by mere centimeters. However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Wi-CBR: Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition
Authors: Ruobei Zhang, Shengeng Tang, Huan Yan, Xiang Zhang, Jiabao Guo
Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, it enables the model to not only explore a wider feature space but also to avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

Title: Manifold Learning for Personalized and Label-Free Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmias
Authors: Amir Reza Vazifeh, Jason W. Fleischer
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable supervised models. ECG signals vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow different labeling standards and may be biased, greatly hindering supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, such as principal component analysis, prioritize large (often obvious) variances and typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. When labels are missing or variations are small, both approaches fail. Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) algorithms, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), can address these challenges and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals without training or prior information. Using lead II and V1 signals from the MIT-BIH dataset, UMAP and t-SNE generate rich two-dimensional latent spaces with visually separable clusters. Applied to mixed populations of heartbeats, these clusters correspond to different individuals, while for single subjects they reveal distinct arrhythmia patterns. A simple classifier on these embeddings discriminates individual recordings with >= 90% accuracy and identifies arrhythmias in single patients with a median accuracy of 98.96% and median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond cardiology.

Title: A constrained optimization approach to nonlinear system identification through simulation error minimization
Authors: Vito Cerone, Sophie M. Fosson, Simone Pirrera, Diego Regruto
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to system identification for nonlinear input-output models that minimizes the simulation error and frames the problem as a constrained optimization task. The proposed method addresses vanishing gradient issues, enabling faster convergence than traditional gradient-based techniques. We present an algorithm based on feedback linearization control of Lagrange multipliers and conduct a theoretical analysis of its performance. We prove that the algorithm converges to a local minimum, and it enhances computational efficiency by exploiting the problem's structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms gradient-based methods in both computational effort and estimation accuracy.

Title: Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting
Authors: Moein Heidari, Mohammad Amin Roohi, Ilker Hacihaliloglu
Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.
