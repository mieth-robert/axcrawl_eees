Title: Double Directional Wireless Channel Generation: A Statistics-Informed Generative Approach
Authors: Md-Ferdous Pervej, Patel Pratik, Koushik Manjunatha, Prasad Shamain, Andreas F. Molisch
Abstract: Channel models that represent various operating conditions a communication system might experience are important for design and standardization of any communication system. While statistical channel models have long dominated this space, machine learning (ML) is becoming a popular alternative approach. However, existing approaches have mostly focused on predictive solutions to match instantaneous channel realizations. Other solutions have focused on pathloss modeling, while double-directional (DD) channel representation is needed for a complete description. Motivated by this, we (a) develop a generative solution that uses a hybrid Transformer (hTransformer) model with a low-rank projected attention calculation mechanism and a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer to generate complete DD channel information and (b) design a domain-knowledge-informed training method to match the generated and true channel realizations' statistics. Our extensive simulation results validate that the generated samples' statistics closely align with the true statistics while mostly outperforming the performance of existing predictive approaches.

Title: Sensing for Communication: RIS-Assisted ISAC Coordination Gain Enhancement With Imperfect CSI
Authors: Xiaohui Li, Qi Zhu, Yunpei Chen, Chadi Assi, Yifei Yuan
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has the potential to facilitate coordination gains from mutual assistance between sensing and communication (S&C), especially sensing-aided communication enhancement (SACE). Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is another potential technique for achieving resource-efficient communication enhancement. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative RIS-assisted SACE (R-SACE) mechanism with the goal of improving the systemic communication performance of the ISAC system in practical scenarios where the channel status information (CSI) is imperfectly known. In the proposed R-SACE mechanism, a dual-functional base station (BS) provides downlink communication services to both the communication user and the dynamically changing target that is detected using the communication signals. RIS assists in both sensing and communications of the BS. A typical scenario is investigated in which either or both the direct and RIS-assisted reflected communication links are available depending on sensing results. The average systemic throughput (AST) over the entire timeline of the R-SACE mechanism is maximized by jointly optimizing both temporal and spatial resources under the probabilistic constraint and the sensing performance, transmission power, and communication interference constraints. The non-convex probabilistic mixed optimization problem is transformed and then solved by the proposed fixed-point iterative (FPI) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FPI algorithm and R-SACE mechanism outperform the baseline algorithms and communication enhancement mechanisms in achieving higher systemic communication performance.

Title: mixEEG: Enhancing EEG Federated Learning for Cross-subject EEG Classification with Tailored mixup
Authors: Xuan-Hao Liu, Bao-Liang Lu, Wei-Long Zheng
Abstract: The cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) classification exhibits great challenges due to the diversity of cognitive processes and physiological structures between different subjects. Modern EEG models are based on neural networks, demanding a large amount of data to achieve high performance and generalizability. However, privacy concerns associated with EEG pose significant limitations to data sharing between different hospitals and institutions, resulting in the lack of large dataset for most EEG tasks. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple decentralized clients to collaboratively train a global model without direct communication of raw data, thus preserving privacy. For the first time, we investigate the cross-subject EEG classification in the FL setting. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework termed mixEEG. Specifically, we tailor the vanilla mixup considering the unique properties of the EEG modality. mixEEG shares the unlabeled averaged data of the unseen subject rather than simply sharing raw data under the domain adaptation setting, thus better preserving privacy and offering an averaged label as pseudo-label. Extensive experiments are conducted on an epilepsy detection and an emotion recognition dataset. The experimental result demonstrates that our mixEEG enhances the transferability of global model for cross-subject EEG classification consistently across different datasets and model architectures.

In this work, we formulate an Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) optimization problem aimed at fairly maximizing beampattern gains across multiple directions of interest, while ensuring that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for communication users and the overall power constraint are satisfied. To solve this problem, we propose an optimization algorithm and provide a formal proof of its convergence.

Title: Comparative analysis of Realistic EMF Exposure Estimation from Low Density Sensor Network by Finite & Infinite Neural Networks
Authors: Mohammed Mallik, Laurent Clavier, Davy P. Gaillot
Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of environmental exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) is essential for conducting risk assessments. These assessments aim to explore potential connections between RF-EMF exposure and its effects on human health, as well as on wildlife and plant life. Existing research has used different machine learning tools for EMF exposure estimation; however, a comparative analysis of these techniques is required to better understand their performance for real-world datasets. In this work, we present both finite and infinite-width convolutional network-based methods to estimate and assess EMF exposure levels from 70 real-world sensors in Lille, France. A comparative analysis has been conducted to analyze the performance of the methods' execution time and estimation accuracy. To improve estimation accuracy for higher-resolution grids, we utilized a preconditioned gradient descent method for kernel estimation. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation criterion for comparing the performance of these deep learning models.

Title: nnInteractiveSlicer: A 3D Slicer extension for nnInteractive
Authors: Coen de Vente, Kiran Vaidhya Venkadesh, Bram van Ginneken, Clara I. SÃ¡nchez
Abstract: nnInteractiveSlicer integrates nnInteractive, a state-of-the-art promptable deep learning-based framework for 3D image segmentation, into the widely used 3D Slicer platform. Our extension implements a client-server architecture that decouples computationally intensive model inference from the client-side interface. Therefore, nnInteractiveSlicer eliminates heavy hardware constraints on the client-side and enables better operating system compatibility than existing plugins for nnInteractive. Running both the client and server-side on a single machine is also possible, offering flexibility across different deployment scenarios. The extension provides an intuitive user interface with all interaction types available in the original framework (point, bounding box, scribble, and lasso prompts), while including a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow.

Title: Towards Simple Machine Learning Baselines for GNSS RFI Detection
Authors: Viktor Ivanov, Richard C. Wilson, Maurizio Scaramuzza
Abstract: Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a proper justification for the decisions made in deep learning-based model architectures. Our paper challenges the status quo in machine learning approaches for GNSS RFI detection, revealing the potentially misleading track of current research and highlighting alternative directions. Our position advocates for a shift in focus from solely pursuing novel model designs to critically evaluating the utility of complex black box deep learning methods against simpler and more interpretable machine learning baselines. Our findings demonstrate the need for the creation of simple baselines and suggest the need for more exploration and development of simple and interpretable machine learning methods for the detection of GNSS RFIs. The increment of model complexity in the state-of-the-art deep learning-based models often provides very little improvement. Thanks to a unique dataset from Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple machine learning baseline for GNSS RFI detection on real-world large-scale aircraft data containing flight recordings impacted by real jamming. The experimental results indicate that our solution successfully detects potential GNSS RFI with 91% accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We believe that our work offers insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.

Title: Fusing Global and Local: Transformer-CNN Synergy for Next-Gen Current Estimation
Authors: Junlang Huang, Hao Chen, Li Luo, Yong Cai, Lexin Zhang, Tianhao Ma, Yitian Zhang, Zhong Guan
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model combining Transformer and CNN for predicting the current waveform in signal lines. Unlike traditional approaches such as current source models, driver linear representations, waveform functional fitting, or equivalent load capacitance methods, our model does not rely on fixed simplified models of standard-cell drivers or RC loads. Instead, it replaces the complex Newton iteration process used in traditional SPICE simulations, leveraging the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer framework to directly predict current responses without iterative solving steps. The hybrid architecture effectively integrates the global feature-capturing ability of Transformers with the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs, significantly improving the accuracy of current waveform predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional SPICE simulations, the proposed algorithm achieves an error of only 0.0098. These results highlight the algorithm's superior capabilities in predicting signal line current waveforms, timing analysis, and power evaluation, making it suitable for a wide range of technology nodes, from 40nm to 3nm.

Title: Estimation of Solar Spectral Irradiance Using Meteorological Data and Analysis of Optimal Conditions for Solar Power Generation
Authors: Jeonggyu Hwang
Abstract: This study proposes an approximate model to estimate the solar radiation spectrum intensity in Seoul, Republic of Korea, for the year 2024, aiming to analyze optimal conditions related to energy generation. Since the solar radiation spectrum varies with atmospheric conditions, accurately predicting it typically requires complex spectral radiation models. However, such models entail high computational costs, hindering real-time application. To address this, this study introduces a simplified approximation model using only direct normal irradiance (DNI) among real-time meteorological elements, employing linear scaling of the standard spectrum (ASTM G-173). This model first estimates DNI using global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and solar position information (such as zenith angle), then linearly adjusts the standard spectrum to compute real-time spectrum intensity. The model approximates realistic DNI values by correcting various meteorological parameters, including zenith angle, cloud cover, and visibility. The analysis shows that GHI exhibits stable seasonal patterns, peaking in summer and minimizing in winter. In contrast, DNI demonstrates significant temporal variability and frequent abnormal peaks (e.g., exceeding 9,000 W/m^2), highlighting the importance of data refinement and anomaly detection in predicting energy generation. In conclusion, GHI is suitable for general photovoltaic analyses, whereas DNI is crucial for direct-beam sensitive systems like concentrated solar power (CSP), requiring meticulous data quality management. Future research should focus on identifying the causes of DNI anomalies and developing real-time quality control algorithms.

Title: DL-AMC: Deep Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification
Authors: Faheem Ur Rehman, Qamar Abbas, M. Karam Shehzad
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a signal processing technique widely used at the physical layer of wireless systems to enhance spectrum utilization efficiency. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate AMC system, termed DL-AMC, which leverages deep learning techniques. Specifically, DL-AMC is built using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNetv2. To evaluate its performance, we curated a comprehensive dataset containing various modulation schemes. Each modulation type was transformed into an eye diagram, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values ranging from -20 dB to 30 dB. We trained the CNN models on this dataset to enable them to learn the discriminative features of each modulation class effectively. Experimental results show that the proposed DL-AMC models achieve high classification accuracy, especially in low SNR conditions. These results highlight the robustness and efficacy of DL-AMC in accurately classifying modulations in challenging wireless environments

Title: A Construction of Pairwise Co-prime Integer Matrices of Any Dimension and Their Least Common Right Multiple
Authors: Guangpu Guo, Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: Compared with co-prime integers, co-prime integer matrices are more challenging due to the non-commutativity. In this paper, we present a new family of pairwise co-prime integer matrices of any dimension and large size. These matrices are non-commutative and have low spread, i.e., their ratios of peak absolute values to mean absolute values (or the smallest non-zero absolute values) of their components are low. When matrix dimension is larger than $2$, this family of matrices differs from the existing families, such as circulant, Toeplitz matrices, or triangular matrices, and therefore, offers more varieties in applications. In this paper, we first prove the pairwise coprimality of the constructed matrices, then determine their determinant absolute values, and their least common right multiple (lcrm) with a closed and simple form. We also analyze their sampling rates when these matrices are used as sampling matrices for a multi-dimensional signal. The proposed family of pairwise co-prime integer matrices may have applications in multi-dimensional Chinese remainder theorem (MD-CRT) that can be used to determine integer vectors from their integer vector remainders modulo a set of integer matrix moduli, and also in multi-dimensional sparse sensing and multirate systems.

Title: Techno-economic environmental and social assessment framework for energy transition pathways in integrated energy communities: a case study in Alaska
Authors: Jayashree Yadav, Ingemar Mathiasson, Bindu Panikkar, Mads Almassalkhi
Abstract: The transition to low-carbon energy systems demands comprehensive evaluation tools that account for technical, economic, environmental, and social dimensions. While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy transition, few provide an integrated framework that captures the full spectrum of impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive techno-economic, environmental, and social (TEES) assessment framework to evaluate energy transition pathways. The framework provides a structured methodology for assessing infrastructure needs, cost implications, emissions reductions, and social equity impacts, offering a systematic approach for informed decision-making. To illustrate its applicability, a detailed case study of a remote community in Alaska is conducted, evaluating the TEES impacts of three distinct energy transition pathways including heat pumps (HPs) and battery integration, resource coordination and expanded community solar photovoltaic (PV). Findings show that coordination of HPs minimizes peak demand, enhances grid reliability, and reduces energy burdens among low-income households. Extensive simulation-based analysis reveals that strategically staging electric HPs with existing oil heating systems can lower overall energy costs by 19% and reduce emissions by 29% compared to the today's system and outperforms all-heat-pump strategy for economic savings. By combining a generalizable, community-centric assessment framework with data-driven case study insights, this work offers a practical tool for utilities, community stakeholders and policymakers to work toward equitable and sustainable energy transitions.

Title: Interpretable Automatic Rosacea Detection with Whitened Cosine Similarity
Authors: Chengyu Yang, Chengjun Liu
Abstract: According to the National Rosacea Society, approximately sixteen million Americans suffer from rosacea, a common skin condition that causes flushing or long-term redness on a person's face. To increase rosacea awareness and to better assist physicians to make diagnosis on this disease, we propose an interpretable automatic rosacea detection method based on whitened cosine similarity in this paper. The contributions of the proposed methods are three-fold. First, the proposed method can automatically distinguish patients suffering from rosacea from people who are clean of this disease with a significantly higher accuracy than other methods in unseen test data, including both classical deep learning and statistical methods. Second, the proposed method addresses the interpretability issue by measuring the similarity between the test sample and the means of two classes, namely the rosacea class versus the normal class, which allows both medical professionals and patients to understand and trust the results. And finally, the proposed methods will not only help increase awareness of rosacea in the general population, but will also help remind patients who suffer from this disease of possible early treatment, as rosacea is more treatable in its early stages.

Title: Wavelet-Based CSI Reconstruction for Improved Wireless Security Through Channel Reciprocity
Authors: Nora Basha, Bechir Hamdaoui
Abstract: The reciprocity of channel state information (CSI) collected by two devices communicating over a wireless channel has been leveraged to provide security solutions to resource-limited IoT devices. Despite the extensive research that has been done on this topic, much of the focus has been on theoretical and simulation analysis. However, these security solutions face key implementation challenges, mostly pertaining to limitations of IoT hardware and variations of channel conditions, limiting their practical adoption. To address this research gap, we revisit the channel reciprocity assumption from an experimental standpoint using resource-constrained devices. Our experimental study reveals a significant degradation in channel reciprocity for low-cost devices due to the varying channel conditions. Through experimental investigations, we first identify key practical causes for the degraded channel reciprocity. We then propose a new wavelet-based CSI reconstruction technique using wavelet coherence and time-lagged cross-correlation to construct CSI data that are consistent between the two participating devices, resulting in significant improvement in channel reciprocity. Additionally, we propose a secret-key generation scheme that exploits the wavelet-based CSI reconstruction, yielding significant increase in the key generation rates. Finally, we propose a technique that exploits CSI temporal variations to enhance device authentication resiliency through effective detection of replay attacks.

Title: Communication-Efficient Cooperative Localization: A Graph Neural Network Approach
Authors: Yinan Zou, Christopher G. Brinton, Vishrant Tripathi
Abstract: Cooperative localization leverages noisy inter-node distance measurements and exchanged wireless messages to estimate node positions in a wireless network. In communication-constrained environments, however, transmitting large messages becomes problematic. In this paper, we propose an approach for communication-efficient cooperative localization that addresses two main challenges. First, cooperative localization often needs to be performed over wireless networks with loopy graph topologies. Second is the need for designing an algorithm that has low localization error while simultaneously requiring a much lower communication overhead. Existing methods fall short of addressing these two challenges concurrently. To achieve this, we propose a vector quantized message passing neural network (VQ-MPNN) for cooperative localization. Through end-to-end neural network training, VQ-MPNN enables the co-design of node localization and message compression. Specifically, VQ-MPNN treats prior node positions and distance measurements as node and edge features, respectively, which are encoded as node and edge states using a graph neural network. To find an efficient representation for the node state, we construct a vector quantized codebook for all node states such that instead of sending long messages, each node only needs to transmit a codeword index. Numerical evaluations demonstrates that our proposed VQ-MPNN approach can deliver localization errors that are similar to existing approaches while reducing the overall communication overhead by an order of magnitude.

Title: SynthFM: Training Modality-agnostic Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation without Real Medical Data
Authors: Sourya Sengupta, Satrajit Chakrabarty, Keerthi Sravan Ravi, Gopal Avinash, Ravi Soni
Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in zero-shot segmentation for natural images but struggle with medical image segmentation due to differences in texture, contrast, and noise. Annotating medical images is costly and requires domain expertise, limiting large-scale annotated data availability. To address this, we propose SynthFM, a synthetic data generation framework that mimics the complexities of medical images, enabling foundation models to adapt without real medical data. Using SAM's pretrained encoder and training the decoder from scratch on SynthFM's dataset, we evaluated our method on 11 anatomical structures across 9 datasets (CT, MRI, and Ultrasound). SynthFM outperformed zero-shot baselines like SAM and MedSAM, achieving superior results under different prompt settings and on out-of-distribution datasets.

Title: Safe Data-Driven Predictive Control
Authors: Amin Vahidi-Moghaddam, Kaian Chen, Kaixiang Zhang, Zhaojian Li, Yan Wang, Kai Wu
Abstract: In the realm of control systems, model predictive control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable potential; however, its reliance on accurate models and substantial computational resources has hindered its broader application, especially within real-time nonlinear systems. This study presents an innovative control framework to enhance the practical viability of the MPC. The developed safe data-driven predictive control aims to eliminate the requirement for precise models and alleviate computational burdens in the nonlinear MPC (NMPC). This is achieved by learning both the system dynamics and the control policy, enabling efficient data-driven predictive control while ensuring system safety. The methodology involves a spatial temporal filter (STF)-based concurrent learning for system identification, a robust control barrier function (RCBF) to ensure the system safety amid model uncertainties, and a RCBF-based NMPC policy approximation. An online policy correction mechanism is also introduced to counteract performance degradation caused by the existing model uncertainties. Demonstrated through simulations on two applications, the proposed approach offers comparable performance to existing benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs.

Title: Adaptive Control of Dubins Vehicle in the Presence of Loss of Effectiveness (Extended Version)
Authors: Daniel Maldonado Naranjo, Anuradha M. Annaswamy
Abstract: The control of a Dubins Vehicle when subjected to a loss of control effectiveness is considered. A complex state-space representation is used to model the vehicle dynamics. An adaptive control design is proposed, with the underlying stability analysis guaranteeing closed-loop boundedness and tracking of a desired path. It is shown that a path constructed by waypoints and a minimum turn radius can be specified using a reference model which can be followed by the closed loop system. The control design utilizes the complex representation as well as a PID controller for the nominal closed-loop. How the design can be modified to ensure that the control input does not saturate is also discussed. Simulation studies are carried out to complement the theoretical derivations.

Title: Advancing Autonomous Vehicle Safety: A Combined Fault Tree Analysis and Bayesian Network Approach
Authors: Lansu Dai, Burak Kantarci
Abstract: This paper integrates Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Bayesian Networks (BN) to assess collision risk and establish Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) B failure rate targets for critical autonomous vehicle (AV) components. The FTA-BN integration combines the systematic decomposition of failure events provided by FTA with the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of BN, which allow for dynamic updates in failure probabilities, enhancing the adaptability of risk assessment. A fault tree is constructed based on AV subsystem architecture, with collision as the top event, and failure rates are assigned while ensuring the total remains within 100 FIT. Bayesian inference is applied to update posterior probabilities, and the results indicate that perception system failures (46.06 FIT) are the most significant contributor, particularly failures to detect existing objects (PF5) and misclassification (PF6). Mitigation strategies are proposed for sensors, perception, decision-making, and motion control to reduce the collision risk. The FTA-BN integration approach provides dynamic risk quantification, offering system designers refined failure rate targets to improve AV safety.

Title: Examining Different Placement Strategies for Indoor Environmental Quality Sensors in Office Environments
Authors: Riccardo Talami, Xinhao Hu, Ilyas Dawoodjee, Ali Ghahramani
Abstract: Collecting Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) data from an occupant's immediate surroundings can provide personalized insights for healthy environmental conditions aligned with occupant preferences, but effective sensor placement for data accuracy and reliability has not been thoroughly explored. This paper explores various positioning of IEQ multi-sensing devices at individual workstations in typical office settings, aiming to identify sensor placements that most accurately reflect the environmental conditions experienced by occupants. We examined five unique positions close to an occupant (above and below the monitor, right side of the desk, ceiling, and chair backrest), two orientations, and three desk locations characterized by different lighting levels, thermal and airflow conditions. Data on temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matters (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), illuminance, and sound were collected over a 2-week longitudinal experiment, followed by short-term experiments simulating common pollution events such as coughing and sneezing. Principal Component Analysis, Spearman's rank correlation, R2, and Mean Absolute Error were applied to identify the position and orientation that best captures the most information and matches breathing zone measurements. It was found that above the monitor position, facing the occupant, best captures the IEQ conditions experienced by the occupant.

Title: Neural Network-assisted Interval Reachability for Systems with Control Barrier Function-Based Safe Controllers
Authors: Damola Ajeyemi, Saber Jafarpour, Emiliano Dall'Anese
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been widely utilized in the design of optimization-based controllers and filters for dynamical systems to ensure forward invariance of a given set of safe states. While CBF-based controllers offer safety guarantees, they can compromise the performance of the system, leading to undesirable behaviors such as unbounded trajectories and emergence of locally stable spurious equilibria. Computing reachable sets for systems with CBF-based controllers is an effective approach for runtime performance and stability verification, and can potentially serve as a tool for trajectory re-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient interval reachability method for performance verification of systems with optimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based controller by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization problems repeatedly, and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an embedding system that leverages state-of-the-art neural network verification algorithms for bounding the output of the neural network. Results in terms of closeness of solutions of trajectories of the system with the optimization-based controller and the neural network are derived. Using a single trajectory of the embedding system along with our closeness of solutions result, we obtain an over-approximation of the reachable set of the system with optimization-based controllers. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the technical findings.

Title: General Theory of Coupled Characteristic Mode: An Eigen Subspace Approach
Authors: Rakesh Sinha, Sandip Ghosal
Abstract: In this work, the problem of characteristic mode analysis using eigendecomposition of the method of moments impedance matrix has been simplified using the eigen-subspace approach. The idea behind the eigen-subspace arises from the physical properties of antenna or scatterers, where only a few eigenmodes are enough to characterize the antenna or scatterer. Therefore, entire space eigenanalysis is a waste of computational resources, and eigen-subspace analysis with few modes is good enough to characterize antennas and scatterers. It has been assumed that there is an eigen-subspace (or hyperplane) of coupled characteristic mode, which coincides with the eigen-hyperplane of uncoupled characteristic mode. We can say the coupled characteristic modes are linear combinations of isolated modes based on this assumption. The linear combination is mapped via modal coupling matrix. Using the modal coupling matrix, we can explain the behavior of arbitrarily shaped antennas and scatterers. A computationally efficient method is developed to compute coupled characteristic modes of two mutually coupled scatterers or antennas using the eigen-subspace. The method is summarized as a theorem of two-body coupled characteristic mode. The theorem of two-body coupled characteristic mode has been extended to the N-body coupled characteristic mode. Two algorithms have been developed for the two-body multimode coupled characteristic mode and N-body multimode coupled characteristic mode. Two numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed concepts.

Authors: Felix BrÃ¤ndle, Frank AllgÃ¶wer
Abstract: Data-driven controller design based on data informativity has gained popularity due to its straightforward applicability, while providing rigorous guarantees. However, applying this framework to the estimator synthesis problem introduces technical challenges, which can only be solved so far by adding restrictive assumptions. In this work, we remove these restrictions to improve performance guarantees. Moreover, our parameterization allows the integration of additional structural knowledge, such as bounds on parameters. Our findings are validated using numerical examples.

Title: Distributed Kalman Filter with Ultimately Accurate Fused Measurement Covariance
Authors: Tuo Yang, Jiachen Qian, Zhisheng Duan, Zhiyong Sun
Abstract: This paper investigates the distributed Kalman filter (DKF) for linear systems, with specific attention on measurement fusion, which is a typical way of information sharing and is vital for enhancing stability and improving estimation accuracy. We show that it is the mismatch between the fused measurement and the fused covariance that leads to performance degradation or inconsistency in previous consensus-based DKF algorithms. To address this issue, we introduce two fully distributed approaches for calculating the exact covariance of the fused measurements, building upon which the modified DKF algorithms are proposed. Moreover, the performance analysis of the modified algorithms is also provided under rather mild conditions, including the steady-state value of the estimation error covariance. We also show that due to the guaranteed consistency in the modified DKF algorithms, the steady-state estimation accuracy is significantly improved compared to classical DKF algorithms. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis and show the advantages of the proposed methods.

Title: Fast Reconfiguration of LC-RISs: Modeling and Algorithm Design
Authors: Mohamadreza Delbari, Robin Neuder, Alejandro JimÃ©nez-SÃ¡ez, Arash Asadi, Vahid Jamali
Abstract: LC technology is a promising hardware solution for realizing extremely large RISs due to its advantages in cost-effectiveness, scalability, energy efficiency, and continuous phase shift tunability. However, the slow response time of the LC cells, especially in comparison to the silicon-based alternatives like radio frequency switches and PIN diodes, limits the performance. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in TDMA applications where RIS must sequentially serve users in different locations, as the phase-shifting response time of LC cells can constrain system performance. This paper addresses the slow phase-shifting limitation of LC by developing a physics-based model for the time response of an LC unit cell and proposing a novel phase-shift design framework to reduce the transition time. Specifically, exploiting the fact that LC-RIS at milimeter wave bands have a large electric aperture, we optimize the LC phase shifts based on user locations, eliminating the need for full channel state information and minimizing reconfiguration overhead. Moreover, instead of focusing on a single point, the RIS phase shifters are designed to optimize coverage over an area. This enhances communication reliability for mobile users and mitigates performance degradation due to user location estimation errors. The proposed design minimizes the transition time between configurations, a critical requirement for TDMA schemes. Our analysis reveals that the impact of RIS reconfiguration time on system throughput becomes particularly significant when TDMA intervals are comparable to the reconfiguration time. In such scenarios, optimizing the phase-shift design helps mitigate performance degradation while ensuring specific QoS requirements. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been tested through experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that it also performs effectively in practice.

Title: Flip-KLJN: Random Resistance Flipping for Noise-Driven Secure Communication
Authors: Recep Akif Tasci, Ibrahim Yildirim, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: The information-theoretically (unconditionally) secure Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) bit exchange protocol uses two identical resistor pairs with high (H) and low (L) resistance values, driven by Gaussian noise generators emulating Johnson noise with a high common temperature. The resulting mean-square noise voltage on the wire connecting Alice and Bob has three levels: low (L/L), intermediate (H/L or L/H), and high (H/H), and secure key sharing is achieved at the intermediate level (L/H or H/L). This paper introduces the Flip-KLJN scheme, where a pre-agreed intermediate level, such as H/L, triggers a flip of the bit map value during the bit exchange period. For Eve, the bit map flips appear random. Thus, the formerly discarded H/H and L/L situations can also have a pre-agreed bit value mapping, which flips together with the original bit mapping. Thus, Flip-KLJN doubles the key rate and ensures that all three levels on the wire are indistinguishable for Eve. Bit error probabilities are addressed through analytic calculations and computer simulations.

Title: An Empirical Investigation of Reconstruction-Based Models for Seizure Prediction from ECG Signals
Authors: Mohammad Reza Chopannavaz, Foad Ghaderi
Abstract: Epileptic seizures are sudden neurological disorders characterized by abnormal, excessive neuronal activity in the brain, which is often associated with changes in cardiovascular activity. These disruptions can pose significant physical and psychological challenges for patients. Therefore, accurate seizure prediction can help mitigate these risks by enabling timely interventions, ultimately improving patients' quality of life. Traditionally, EEG signals have been the primary standard for seizure prediction due to their precision in capturing brain activity. However, their high cost, susceptibility to noise, and logistical constraints limit their practicality, restricting their use to clinical settings. In order to overcome these limitations, this study focuses on leveraging ECG signals as an alternative for seizure prediction. In this paper, we present a novel method for predicting seizures based on detecting anomalies in ECG signals during their reconstruction. By extracting time-frequency features and leveraging various advanced deep learning architectures, the proposed method identifies deviations in heart rate dynamics associated with seizure onset. The proposed approach was evaluated using the Siena database and could achieve specificity of 99.16\%, accuracy of 76.05\%, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.01/h, with an average prediction time of 45 minutes before seizure onset. These results highlight the potential of ECG-based seizure prediction as a patient-friendly alternative to traditional EEG-based methods.

Title: Statistical Linear Regression Approach to Kalman Filtering and Smoothing under Cyber-Attacks
Authors: Kundan Kumar, Muhammad Iqbal, Simo SÃ¤rkkÃ¤
Abstract: Remote state estimation in cyber-physical systems is often vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to wireless connections between sensors and computing units. In such scenarios, adversaries compromise the system by injecting false data or blocking measurement transmissions via denial-of-service attacks, distorting sensor readings. This paper develops a Kalman filter and Rauch--Tung--Striebel (RTS) smoother for linear stochastic state-space models subject to cyber-attacked measurements. We approximate the faulty measurement model via generalized statistical linear regression (GSLR). The GSLR-based approximated measurement model is then used to develop a Kalman filter and RTS smoother for the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under cyber-attacks is demonstrated through a simulated aircraft tracking experiment.

Title: Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter for trajectory measurements
Authors: Marco Fontana, Ãngel F. GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez, Simon Maskell
Abstract: This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.

Title: Successive Jump and Mode Decomposition
Authors: Mojtaba Nazari, Anders Rosendal KorshÃ¸j, Naveed ur Rehman
Abstract: We propose fully data-driven variational methods, termed successive jump and mode decomposition (SJMD) and its multivariate extension, successive multivariate jump and mode decomposition (SMJMD), for successively decomposing nonstationary signals into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and jump components. Unlike existing methods that treat oscillatory modes and jump discontinuities separately and often require prior knowledge of the number of components (K) -- which is difficult to obtain in practice -- our approaches employ successive optimization-based schemes that jointly handle AM-FM oscillations and jump discontinuities without the need to predefine K. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Artifact detection and localization in single-channel mobile EEG for sleep research using deep learning and attention mechanisms
Authors: Khrystyna Semkiv, Jia Zhang, Maria Laura Ferster, Walter Karlen
Abstract: Artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) degrade signal quality and impact the analysis of brain activity. Current methods for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual intervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of data that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG with attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine learning and signal processing approaches. We trained/tuned all models on 72 manually annotated EEG recordings obtained during home-based monitoring from 18 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.05 y ($\pm$5.02). We tested them on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.33 y ($\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\% of epochs. CNN-CBAM achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other approaches. The attention maps from CNN-CBAM localized artifacts within the epoch with a sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.67. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automating the detection and localization of artifacts in wearable sleep EEG.

Title: Physics-informed data-driven control without persistence of excitation
Authors: Martina Vanelli, Julien M. Hendrickx
Abstract: We show that data that is not sufficiently informative to allow for system re-identification can still provide meaningful information when combined with external or physical knowledge of the system, such as bounded system matrix norms. We then illustrate how this information can be leveraged for safety and energy minimization problems and to enhance predictions in unmodelled dynamics. This preliminary work outlines key ideas toward using limited data for effective control by integrating physical knowledge of the system and exploiting interpolation conditions.

Title: AI-Driven Smart Sportswear for Real-Time Fitness Monitoring Using Textile Strain Sensors
Authors: Chenyu Tang, Wentian Yi, Zibo Zhang, Edoardo Occhipinti, Luigi G. Occhipinti
Abstract: Wearable biosensors have revolutionized human performance monitoring by enabling real-time assessment of physiological and biomechanical parameters. However, existing solutions lack the ability to simultaneously capture breath-force coordination and muscle activation symmetry in a seamless and non-invasive manner, limiting their applicability in strength training and rehabilitation. This work presents a wearable smart sportswear system that integrates screen-printed graphene-based strain sensors with a wireless deep learning framework for real-time classification of exercise execution quality. By leveraging 1D ResNet-18 for feature extraction, the system achieves 92.3% classification accuracy across six exercise conditions, distinguishing between breathing irregularities and asymmetric muscle exertion. Additionally, t-SNE analysis and Grad-CAM-based explainability visualization confirm that the network accurately captures biomechanically relevant features, ensuring robust interpretability. The proposed system establishes a foundation for next-generation AI-powered sportswear, with applications in fitness optimization, injury prevention, and adaptive rehabilitation training.

Title: STF-GCN: A Multi-Domain Graph Convolution Network Method for Automatic Modulation Recognition via Adaptive Correlation
Authors: Mingyuan Shao, Zhengqiu Fu, Dingzhao Li, Fuqing Zhang, Yilin Cai, Shaohua Hong, Lin Cao, Yuan Peng, Jie Qi
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is an essential part of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) dynamic spectrum allocation. However, current deep learning-based AMR (DL-AMR) methods are challenged to extract discriminative and robust features at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where the representation of modulation symbols is highly interfered by noise. Furthermore, current research on GNN methods for AMR tasks generally suffers from issues related to graph structure construction and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal-Frequency Graph Convolution Network (STF-GCN) framework, with the temporal domain as the anchor point, to fuse spatial and frequency domain features embedded in the graph structure nodes. On this basis, an adaptive correlation-based adjacency matrix construction method is proposed, which significantly enhances the graph structure's capacity to aggregate local information into individual nodes. In addition, a PoolGAT layer is proposed to coarsen and compress the global key features of the graph, significantly reducing the computational complexity. The results of the experiments confirm that STF-GCN is able to achieve recognition performance far beyond the state-of-the-art DL-AMR algorithms, with overall accuracies of 64.35%, 66.04% and 70.95% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b and RML22 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracies under low SNR conditions from -14dB to 0dB outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by 1.20%, 1.95% and 1.83%, respectively.

Title: POD-Based Sparse Stochastic Estimation of Wind Turbine Blade Vibrations
Authors: Lorenzo Schena, Wim Munters, Jan Helsen, Miguel A. Mendez
Abstract: This study presents a framework for estimating the full vibrational state of wind turbine blades from sparse deflection measurements. The identification is performed in a reduced-order space obtained from a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations based on Geometrically Exact Beam Theory (GEBT). In this space, a Reduced Order Model (ROM) is constructed using a linear stochastic estimator, and further enhanced through Kalman fusion with a quasi-steady model of azimuthal dynamics driven by measured wind speed. The performance of the proposed estimator is assessed in a synthetic environment replicating turbulent inflow and measurement noise over a wide range of operating conditions. Results demonstrate the method's ability to accurately reconstruct three-dimensional deformations and accelerations using noisy displacement and acceleration measurements at only four spatial locations. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework for real-time blade monitoring, optimal sensor placement, and active load control in wind turbine systems.

Title: Joint Transmit Waveform and Receive Filter Design for ISAC System with Jamming
Authors: Yuan Shu, Chenhao Qi, Shiwen Mao
Abstract: In this paper, to suppress jamming in the complex electromagnetic environment, we propose a joint transmit waveform and receive filter design framework for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). By jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and receive filters, we aim at minimizing the multiuser interference (MUI), subject to the constraints of the target mainlobe, jamming mainlobe and peak sidelobe level of the receive filter output as well as the transmit power of the ISAC base station. We propose two schemes to solve the problem, including joint transmit waveform and matched filter design (JTMD) and joint transmit waveform and mismatched filter design (JTMMD) schemes. For both schemes, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to iteratively optimize the transmit waveform and receive filters, where the number of targets as well as the range and angles of each target can also be estimated. Simulation results show that both the JTMD and JTMMD schemes achieve superior performance in terms of communication MUI and radar detection performance.

Title: Mitigating Timbre Leakage with Universal Semantic Mapping Residual Block for Voice Conversion
Authors: Na Li, Chuke Wang, Yu Gu, Zhifeng Li
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) transforms source speech into a target voice by preserving the content. However, timbre information from the source speaker is inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we introduce a residual block to a content extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module, each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.

Title: Secondary Safety Control for Systems with Sector Bounded Nonlinearities
Authors: Yankai Lin, Michelle S. Chong, Carlos Murguia
Abstract: We consider the problem of safety verification and safety-aware controller synthesis for systems with sector bounded nonlinearities. We aim to keep the states of the system within a given safe set under potential actuator and sensor attacks. Specifically, we adopt the setup that a controller has already been designed to stabilize the plant. Using invariant sets and barrier certificate theory, we first give sufficient conditions to verify the safety of the closed-loop system under attacks. Furthermore, by using a subset of sensors that are assumed to be free of attacks, we provide a synthesis method for a secondary controller that enhances the safety of the system. The sufficient conditions to verify safety are derived using Lyapunov-based tools and the S-procedure. Using the projection lemma, the conditions are then formulated as linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems which can be solved efficiently. Lastly, our theoretical results are illustrated through numerical simulations.

Title: Control Co-Design Under Uncertainty for Offshore Wind Farms: Optimizing Grid Integration, Energy Storage, and Market Participation
Authors: Himanshu Sharma, Wei Wang, Bowen Huang, Buxin She, Thiagarajan Ramachandaran
Abstract: Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.

Title: Distributed Uplink Joint Transmission for 6G Communication
Authors: Kumar Sai Bondada, Usama Saeed, Yibin Liang, Daniel J. Jakubisin, Lingjia Liu, R. Michael Buehrer
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral efficiency achieved through uplink joint transmission, where a serving user and the network users (UEs) collaborate by jointly transmitting to the base station (BS). The analysis incorporates the resource requirements for information sharing among UEs as a critical factor in the capacity evaluation. Furthermore, coherent and non-coherent joint transmission schemes are compared under various transmission power scenarios, providing insights into spectral and energy efficiency. A selection algorithm identifying the optimal UEs for joint transmission, achieving maximum capacity, is discussed. The results indicate that uplink joint transmission is one of the promising techniques for enabling 6G, achieving greater spectral efficiency even when accounting for the resource requirements for information sharing.

Title: Channel Estimation and Hybrid Precoding for Massive MIMO-OTFS System With Doubly Squint
Authors: Mingming Duan, Pengfei Zhang, Shun Zhang, Yao Ge, Octavia A. Dobre, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) are promising technologies for next generation wireless communication systems for their abilities to counteract the issue of high mobility with large Doppler spread and mitigate the channel path attenuation, respectively. The natural integration of massive MIMO with OTFS in millimeter-wave systems can improve communication data rate and enhance the spectral efficiency. However, when transmitting wideband signals with large-scale arrays, the beam squint effect may occur, causing discrepancies in beam directions across subcarriers in multi-carrier systems. Moreover, the high-mobility wideband millimeter wave communications can induce the Doppler squint effect, leading to different Doppler shifts among the subcarriers. Both beam squint effect and Doppler squint effect (denoted as doubly squint effect) can degrade communication performance significantly. In this paper, we present an efficient channel estimation and hybrid precoding scheme to address the doubly squint effect in massive MIMO-OTFS systems. We first characterize the wideband channel model and the input-output relationship for massive MIMO-OTFS transmission considering doubly squint effect. We then mathematically derive the impact of channel parameters on chirp pilots under the doubly squint effect. Additionally, we develop a peak-index-based channel estimation scheme. By leveraging the results from channel estimation, we propose a hybrid precoding method to mitigate the doubly squint effect in downlink transmission scenarios. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and show its superiority over the existing schemes.

Title: Analysis of the Unscented Transform Controller for Systems with Bounded Nonlinearities
Authors: Siddharth A. Dinkar, Ram Padmanabhan, Anna Clarke, Per-Olof Gutman, Melkior Ornik
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the Unscented Transform Controller (UTC), a technique to control nonlinear systems motivated as a dual to the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). We consider linear, discrete-time systems augmented by a bounded nonlinear function of the state. For such systems, we review 1-step and N-step versions of the UTC. Using a Lyapunov-based analysis, we prove that the states and inputs converge to a bounded ball around the origin, whose radius depends on the bound on the nonlinearity. Using examples of a fighter jet model and a quadcopter, we demonstrate that the UTC achieves satisfactory regulation and tracking performance on these nonlinear models.

Title: TorchFX: A modern approach to Audio DSP with PyTorch and GPU acceleration
Authors: Matteo Spanio, Antonio RodÃ 
Abstract: The burgeoning complexity and real-time processing demands of audio signals necessitate optimized algorithms that harness the computational prowess of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Existing Digital Signal Processing (DSP) libraries often fall short in delivering the requisite efficiency and flexibility, particularly in integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. In response, we introduce TorchFX: a GPU-accelerated Python library for DSP, specifically engineered to facilitate sophisticated audio signal processing. Built atop the PyTorch framework, TorchFX offers an Object-Oriented interface that emulates the usability of torchaudio, enhancing functionality with a novel pipe operator for intuitive filter chaining. This library provides a comprehensive suite of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, with a focus on multichannel audio files, thus facilitating the integration of DSP and AI-based approaches. Our benchmarking results demonstrate significant efficiency gains over traditional libraries like SciPy, particularly in multichannel contexts. Despite current limitations in GPU compatibility, ongoing developments promise broader support and real-time processing capabilities. TorchFX aims to become a useful tool for the community, contributing to innovation and progress in DSP with GPU acceleration. TorchFX is publicly available on GitHub at this https URL.

Authors: Zhouchang Li, Runze Lin, Hongye Su, Lei Xie
Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0, the refining industry is evolving towards large-scale integration and flexible production systems. In response to these new demands, this paper presents a novel optimization framework for plant-wide refinery planning, integrating model decomposition with deep reinforcement learning. The approach decomposes the complex large scale refinery optimization problem into manageable submodels, improving computational efficiency while preserving accuracy. A reinforcement learning-based pricing mechanism is introduced to generate pricing strategies for intermediate products, facilitating better coordination between submodels and enabling rapid responses to market changes. Three industrial case studies, covering both single-period and multi-period planning, demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency while ensuring refinery profitability.

Title: Reverberation-based Features for Sound Event Localization and Detection with Distance Estimation
Authors: Davide Berghi, Philip J. B. Jackson
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) involves predicting active sound event classes over time while estimating their positions. The localization subtask in SELD is usually treated as a direction of arrival estimation problem, ignoring source distance. Only recently, SELD was extended to 3D by incorporating distance estimation, enabling the prediction of sound event positions in 3D space (3D SELD). However, existing methods lack input features designed for distance estimation. We argue that reverberation encodes valuable information for this task. This paper introduces two novel feature formats for 3D SELD based on reverberation: one using direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) and another leveraging signal autocorrelation to provide the model with insights into early reflections. Pre-training on synthetic data improves relative distance error (RDE) and overall SELD score, with autocorrelation-based features reducing RDE by over 3 percentage points on the STARSS23 dataset. The code to extract the features is available at this http URL.

Title: Multi-user Wireless Image Semantic Transmission over MIMO Multiple Access Channels
Authors: Bingyan Xie, Yongpeng Wu, Feng Shu, Jiangzhou Wang, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: This paper focuses on a typical uplink transmission scenario over multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC) and thus propose a multi-user learnable CSI fusion semantic communication (MU-LCFSC) framework. It incorporates CSI as the side information into both the semantic encoders and decoders to generate a proper feature mask map in order to produce a more robust attention weight distribution. Especially for the decoding end, a cooperative successive interference cancellation procedure is conducted along with a cooperative mask ratio generator, which flexibly controls the mask elements of feature mask maps. Numerical results verify the superiority of proposed MU-LCFSC compared to DeepJSCC-NOMA over 3 dB in terms of PSNR.

Authors: Enzo Ferreira Tomaz Silva, Pedro Henrique Silva Coutinho, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Miroslav KrstiÄ
Abstract: This paper deals with the gradient-based extremum seeking control for multivariable maps under actuator saturation. By exploiting a polytopic embedding of the unknown Hessian, we derive a LMI-based synthesis condition to ensure that the origin of the average closed-loop error system is exponentially stable. Then, the convergence of the extremum seeking control system under actuator saturation to the unknown optimal point is proved by employing Lyapunov stability and averaging theories. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: From Speech to Summary: A Comprehensive Survey of Speech Summarization
Authors: Fabian Retkowski, Maike ZÃ¼fle, Andreas Sudmann, Dinah Pfau, Jan Niehues, Alexander Waibel
Abstract: Speech summarization has become an essential tool for efficiently managing and accessing the growing volume of spoken and audiovisual content. However, despite its increasing importance, speech summarization is still not clearly defined and intersects with several research areas, including speech recognition, text summarization, and specific applications like meeting summarization. This survey not only examines existing datasets and evaluation methodologies, which are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of summarization approaches but also synthesizes recent developments in the field, highlighting the shift from traditional systems to advanced models like fine-tuned cascaded architectures and end-to-end solutions.

Title: Influence of the particle morphology on the spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas process
Authors: Y. Sinnwell, A. Maksakov, S. Palis, S. Antonyuk
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of particle morphology on spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas spraying (LPCGS) by analyzing three copper powders with distinct shapes and microstructures. A comprehensive morphology analysis was conducted using both 2D and 3D imaging techniques. Light microscopy combined with image processing quantified particle circularity in 2D projections, while X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) enabled precise 3D reconstructions to determine sphericity, surface area, and volume distributions. The results showed significant variations in the particle morphology of the investigated feedstock copper powders, with irregularly shaped particles exhibiting lower circularity and sphericity compared to more spherical feedstocks. These morphological differences had a direct impact on the particle velocity distributions and spatial dispersion within the spray jet, as measured by high-speed particle image velocimetry. Irregular particles experienced stronger acceleration and exhibited a more focused spray dispersion, whereas spherical particles reached lower maximum velocities and showed a wider dispersion in the jet. These findings highlight the critical role of particle morphology in optimization of cold spray processes for advanced coating and additive manufacturing applications.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Day-to-day Dynamic Tolling in Tradable Credit Schemes
Authors: Xiaoyi Wu, Ravi Seshadri, Filipe Rodrigues, Carlos Lima Azevedo
Abstract: Tradable credit schemes (TCS) are an increasingly studied alternative to congestion pricing, given their revenue neutrality and ability to address issues of equity through the initial credit allocation. Modeling TCS to aid future design and implementation is associated with challenges involving user and market behaviors, demand-supply dynamics, and control mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the latter and address the day-to-day dynamic tolling problem under TCS, which is formulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process and solved using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Our results indicate that RL algorithms achieve travel times and social welfare comparable to the Bayesian optimization benchmark, with generalization across varying capacities and demand levels. We further assess the robustness of RL under different hyperparameters and apply regularization techniques to mitigate action oscillation, which generates practical tolling strategies that are transferable under day-to-day demand and supply variability. Finally, we discuss potential challenges such as scaling to large networks, and show how transfer learning can be leveraged to improve computational efficiency and facilitate the practical deployment of RL-based TCS solutions.

Title: RL-based Control of UAS Subject to Significant Disturbance
Authors: Kousheek Chakraborty, Thijs Hof, Ayham Alharbat, Abeje Mersha
Abstract: This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based control framework for position and attitude control of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) subjected to significant disturbance that can be associated with an uncertain trigger signal. The proposed method learns the relationship between the trigger signal and disturbance force, enabling the system to anticipate and counteract the impending disturbances before they occur. We train and evaluate three policies: a baseline policy trained without exposure to the disturbance, a reactive policy trained with the disturbance but without the trigger signal, and a predictive policy that incorporates the trigger signal as an observation and is exposed to the disturbance during training. Our simulation results show that the predictive policy outperforms the other policies by minimizing position deviations through a proactive correction maneuver. This work highlights the potential of integrating predictive cues into RL frameworks to improve UAS performance.

Title: InSPE: Rapid Evaluation of Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement
Authors: Zhaoliang Zheng, Yun Zhang, Zongling Meng, Johnson Liu, Xin Xia, Jiaqi Ma
Abstract: Infrastructure sensing is vital for traffic monitoring at safety hotspots (e.g., intersections) and serves as the backbone of cooperative perception in autonomous driving. While vehicle sensing has been extensively studied, infrastructure sensing has received little attention, especially given the unique challenges of diverse intersection geometries, complex occlusions, varying traffic conditions, and ambient environments like lighting and weather. To address these issues and ensure cost-effective sensor placement, we propose Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement Evaluation (InSPE), a perception surrogate metric set that rapidly assesses perception effectiveness across diverse infrastructure and environmental scenarios with combinations of multi-modal sensors. InSPE systematically evaluates perception capabilities by integrating three carefully designed metrics, i.e., sensor coverage, perception occlusion, and information gain. To support large-scale evaluation, we develop a data generation tool within the CARLA simulator and also introduce Infra-Set, a dataset covering diverse intersection types and environmental conditions. Benchmarking experiments with state-of-the-art perception algorithms demonstrate that InSPE enables efficient and scalable sensor placement analysis, providing a robust solution for optimizing intelligent intersection infrastructure.

Title: Spectral Normalization for Lipschitz-Constrained Policies on Learning Humanoid Locomotion
Authors: Jaeyong Shin, Woohyun Cha, Donghyeon Kim, Junhyeok Cha, Jaeheung Park
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in training agile and adaptable controllers for legged robots, enabling them to learn complex locomotion behaviors directly from experience. However, policies trained in simulation often fail to transfer to real-world robots due to unrealistic assumptions such as infinite actuator bandwidth and the absence of torque limits. These conditions allow policies to rely on abrupt, high-frequency torque changes, which are infeasible for real actuators with finite bandwidth. Traditional methods address this issue by penalizing aggressive motions through regularization rewards, such as joint velocities, accelerations, and energy consumption, but they require extensive hyperparameter tuning. Alternatively, Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP) enforce finite bandwidth action control by penalizing policy gradients, but their reliance on gradient calculations introduces significant GPU memory overhead. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes Spectral Normalization (SN) as an efficient replacement for enforcing Lipschitz continuity. By constraining the spectral norm of network weights, SN effectively limits high-frequency policy fluctuations while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Experimental evaluations in both simulation and real-world humanoid robot show that SN achieves performance comparable to gradient penalty methods while enabling more efficient parallel training.

Title: Generalized Multilingual Text-to-Speech Generation with Language-Aware Style Adaptation
Authors: Haowei Lou, Hye-young Paik, Sheng Li, Wen Hu, Lina Yao
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) models can generate natural, human-like speech across multiple languages by transforming phonemes into waveforms. However, multilingual TTS remains challenging due to discrepancies in phoneme vocabularies and variations in prosody and speaking style across languages. Existing approaches either train separate models for each language, which achieve high performance at the cost of increased computational resources, or use a unified model for multiple languages that struggles to capture fine-grained, language-specific style variations. In this work, we propose LanStyleTTS, a non-autoregressive, language-aware style adaptive TTS framework that standardizes phoneme representations and enables fine-grained, phoneme-level style control across languages. This design supports a unified multilingual TTS model capable of producing accurate and high-quality speech without the need to train language-specific models. We evaluate LanStyleTTS by integrating it with several state-of-the-art non-autoregressive TTS architectures. Results show consistent performance improvements across different model backbones. Furthermore, we investigate a range of acoustic feature representations, including mel-spectrograms and autoencoder-derived latent features. Our experiments demonstrate that latent encodings can significantly reduce model size and computational cost while preserving high-quality speech generation.

Title: Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux
Authors: Ming Xu, Stephen Gould, Iman Shames
Abstract: We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite horizon optimal control problems with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on four robotic motion planning problems. IPDDP2 reliably converges to low optimality error and exhibits local quadratic and global convergence from remote starting points. Notably, we showcase the robustness of IPDDP2 by using it to solve a contact-implicit, joint limited acrobot swing-up problem involving complementarity constraints from a range of initial conditions. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.

Title: Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization
Authors: Xueping Zhang, Yaxiong Chen, Ruilin Yao, Yunfei Zi, Shengwu Xiong
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.

Title: Passive Underwater Acoustic Signal Separation based on Feature Decoupling Dual-path Network
Authors: Yucheng Liu, Longyu Jiang
Abstract: Signal separation in the passive underwater acoustic domain has heavily relied on deep learning techniques to isolate ship radiated noise. However, the separation networks commonly used in this domain stem from speech separation applications and may not fully consider the unique aspects of underwater acoustics beforehand, such as the influence of different propagation media, signal frequencies and modulation characteristics. This oversight highlights the need for tailored approaches that account for the specific characteristics of underwater sound propagation. This study introduces a novel temporal network designed to separate ship radiated noise by employing a dual-path model and a feature decoupling approach. The mixed signals' features are transformed into a space where they exhibit greater independence, with each dimension's significance decoupled. Subsequently, a fusion of local and global attention mechanisms is employed in the separation layer. Extensive comparisons showcase the effectiveness of this method when compared to other prevalent network models, as evidenced by its performance in the ShipsEar and DeepShip datasets.

Title: On the Design of Diffusion-based Neural Speech Codecs
Authors: Pietro Foti, Andreas Brendel
Abstract: Recently, neural speech codecs (NSCs) trained as generative models have shown superior performance compared to conventional codecs at low bitrates. Although most state-of-the-art NSCs are trained as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models (DMs), a recent class of generative models, represent a promising alternative due to their superior performance in image generation relative to GANs. Consequently, DMs have been successfully applied for audio and speech coding among various other audio generation applications. However, the design of diffusion-based NSCs has not yet been explored in a systematic way. We address this by providing a comprehensive analysis of diffusion-based NSCs divided into three contributions. First, we propose a categorization based on the conditioning and output domains of the DM. This simple conceptual framework allows us to define a design space for diffusion-based NSCs and to assign a category to existing approaches in the literature. Second, we systematically investigate unexplored designs by creating and evaluating new diffusion-based NSCs within the conceptual framework. Finally, we compare the proposed models to existing GAN and DM baselines through objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

Title: Sectoral and spatial decomposition methods for multi-sector capacity expansion models
Authors: Federico Parolin, Yu Weng, Paolo Colbertaldo, Ruaridh Macdonald
Abstract: Multi-sector capacity expansion models play a crucial role in energy planning by providing decision support for policymaking in technology development. To ensure reliable support, these models require high technological, spatial, and temporal resolution, leading to large-scale linear programming problems that are often computationally intractable. To address this challenge, conventional approaches rely on simplifying abstractions that trade accuracy for computational efficiency. Benders decomposition has been widely explored to improve computational efficiency in electricity capacity expansion models. Specifically, state-of-the-art methods have primarily focused on improving performance through temporal decomposition. However, multi-sector models introduce additional complexity, requiring new decomposition strategies. In this work, we propose a budget-based formulation to extend decomposition to the sectoral and spatial domains. We test the developed sectoral and spatial Benders decomposition algorithms on case studies of the continental United States, considering different configurations in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. Results show that our algorithms achieve substantial performance improvement compared to existing decomposition algorithms, with runtime reductions within 15%-70%. The proposed methods leverage the generic structure of multi-sector capacity expansion models, and can thus be applied to most existing energy planning models, ensuring computational tractability without sacrificing resolution.

Title: On The Landscape of Spoken Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Siddhant Arora, Kai-Wei Chang, Chung-Ming Chien, Yifan Peng, Haibin Wu, Yossi Adi, Emmanuel Dupoux, Hung-Yi Lee, Karen Livescu, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: The field of spoken language processing is undergoing a shift from training custom-built, task-specific models toward using and optimizing spoken language models (SLMs) which act as universal speech processing systems. This trend is similar to the progression toward universal language models that has taken place in the field of (text) natural language processing. SLMs include both "pure" language models of speech -- models of the distribution of tokenized speech sequences -- and models that combine speech encoders with text language models, often including both spoken and written input or output. Work in this area is very diverse, with a range of terminology and evaluation settings. This paper aims to contribute an improved understanding of SLMs via a unifying literature survey of recent work in the context of the evolution of the field. Our survey categorizes the work in this area by model architecture, training, and evaluation choices, and describes some key challenges and directions for future work.

Authors: Kaleb Ben Naveed, Devansh R. Agrawal, Daniel M. Cherenson, Haejoon Lee, Alia Gilbert, Hardik Parwana, Vishnu S. Chipade, William Bentz, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Ensuring safe autonomy is crucial for deploying aerial robots in real-world applications. However, safety is a multifaceted challenge that must be addressed from multiple perspectives, including navigation in dynamic environments, operation under resource constraints, and robustness against adversarial attacks and uncertainties. In this paper, we present the authors' recent work that tackles some of these challenges and highlights key aspects that must be considered to enhance the safety and performance of autonomous aerial systems. All presented approaches are validated through hardware experiments.

Title: Neural Fidelity Calibration for Informative Sim-to-Real Adaptation
Authors: Youwei Yu, Lantao Liu
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and navigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands expert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge simulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the reconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity Calibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based diffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual fidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual fidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world dynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us to sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy fine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a) we fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build sequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the diffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may degrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable hallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator calibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse robots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical contribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and real-world experiments. Notably, our approach demonstrates robust robot navigation under challenging real-world conditions, such as a broken wheel axle on snowy surfaces.

Title: Enhancing knowledge retention for continual learning with domain-specific adapters and features gating
Authors: Mohamed Abbas Hedjazi, Oussama Hadjerci, Adel Hafiane
Abstract: Continual learning empowers models to learn from a continuous stream of data while preserving previously acquired knowledge, effectively addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. In this study, we propose a new approach that integrates adapters within the self-attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers to enhance knowledge retention when sequentially adding datasets from different domains. Unlike previous methods that continue learning with only one dataset, our approach introduces domain-specific output heads and feature gating, allowing the model to maintain high accuracy on previously learned tasks while incorporating only the essential information from multiple domains. The proposed method is compared to prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in the current state of the art. The results provide evidence that our method effectively alleviates the limitations of previous works. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis using three datasets, CIFAR-100, Flowers102, and DTD, each representing a distinct domain, to investigate the impact of task order on model performance. Our findings underscore the critical role of dataset sequencing in shaping learning outcomes, demonstrating that strategic ordering can significantly improve the model's ability to adapt to evolving data distributions over time while preserving the integrity of previously learned knowledge.

Title: Safe Flow Matching: Robot Motion Planning with Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Xiaobing Dai, Dian Yu, Shanshan Zhang, Zewen Yang
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with unseen environments or dynamic constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching (SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow matching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain within safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of previously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of constraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion planning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety, generalization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

Title: Performance Evaluation of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for a Quadruped Robot Leg
Authors: Hossein Shojaei, Hamid Rahmanei, Seyed Hossein Sadati
Abstract: The complexities in the dynamic model of the legged robots make it necessary to utilize model-free controllers in the task of trajectory tracking. In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.

Title: Nonparametric Steady-state Learning for Robust Output Regulation of Nonlinear Output Feedback Systems
Authors: Shimin Wang, Martin Guay, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the presented nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization endeavour for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics, removing the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semidefinite derivatives and the commmonly employed assumption that the nonlinear system should be linear-in-parameter(parameterized) condition. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be classified into a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state/input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous by guaranteeing convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.

Title: On output consensus of heterogeneous dynamical networks
Authors: Yongkang Su, Lanlan Su, Sei Zhen Khong
Abstract: This work is concerned with interconnected networks with non-identical subsystems. We investigate the output consensus of the network where the dynamics are subject to external disturbance and/or reference input. For a network of output-feedback passive subsystems, we first introduce an index that characterises the gap between a pair of adjacent subsystems by the difference of their input-output trajectories. The set of these indices quantifies the level of heterogeneity of the networks. We then provide a condition in terms of the level of heterogeneity and the connectivity of the networks for ensuring the output consensus of the interconnected network.

Title: Formal Verification and Control with Conformal Prediction
Authors: Lars Lindemann, Yiqi Zhao, Xinyi Yu, George J. Pappas, Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh
Abstract: In this survey, we design formal verification and control algorithms for autonomous systems with practical safety guarantees using conformal prediction (CP), a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. We focus on learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs) in which the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) is a major bottleneck that hampers the use of existing model-based verification and design techniques. Instead, we advocate for the use of CP, and we will demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control theory, and robotics. We argue that CP is specifically useful due to its simplicity (easy to understand, use, and modify), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and data distributions, i.e., is distribution-free), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate). We pursue the following goals with this survey. First, we provide an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts who are interested in using CP to solve problems in autonomy. Second, we show how to use CP for the verification of LECs, e.g., for verifying input-output properties of neural networks. Third and fourth, we review recent articles that use CP for safe control design as well as offline and online verification of LEASs. We summarize their ideas in a unifying framework that can deal with the complexity of LEASs in a computationally efficient manner. In our exposition, we consider simple system specifications, e.g., robot navigation tasks, as well as complex specifications formulated in temporal logic formalisms. Throughout our survey, we compare to other statistical techniques (e.g., scenario optimization, PAC-Bayes theory, etc.) and how these techniques have been used in verification and control. Lastly, we point the reader to open problems and future research directions.

Title: Construction of the Sparsest Maximally r-Robust Graphs
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: In recent years, the notion of r-robustness for the communication graph of the network has been introduced to address the challenge of achieving consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Higher r-robustness typically implies higher tolerance to malicious information towards achieving resilient consensus, but it also implies more edges for the communication graph. This in turn conflicts with the need to minimize communication due to limited resources in real-world applications (e.g., multi-robot networks). In this paper, our contributions are twofold. (a) We provide the necessary subgraph structures and tight lower bounds on the number of edges required for graphs with a given number of nodes to achieve maximum robustness. (b) We then use the results of (a) to introduce two classes of graphs that maintain maximum robustness with the least number of edges. Our work is validated through a series of simulations.

Title: A System Parametrization for Direct Data-Driven Analysis and Control with Error-in-Variables
Authors: Felix BrÃ¤ndle, Frank AllgÃ¶wer
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new parametrization to perform direct data-driven analysis and controller synthesis for the error-in-variables case. To achieve this, we employ the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to transform the problem into a linear fractional transformation (LFT) with unknown measurement errors and disturbances as uncertainties. For bounded uncertainties, we apply robust control techniques to derive a guaranteed upper bound on the H2-norm of the unknown true system. To this end, a single semidefinite program (SDP) needs to be solved, with complexity that is independent of the amount of data. Furthermore, we exploit the signal-to-noise ratio to provide a data-dependent condition, that characterizes whether the proposed parametrization can be employed. The modular formulation allows to extend this framework to controller synthesis with different performance criteria, input-output settings, and various system properties. Finally, we validate the proposed approach through a numerical example.

Title: Scaled Relative Graph Analysis of Lur'e Systems and the Generalized Circle Criterion
Authors: Julius P.J. Krebbekx, Roland TÃ³th, Amritam Das
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from a pitfall that limit its applicability in analyzing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome this pitfall by modifying the SRG of a linear time invariant operator, combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion, and apply our result to Lur'e systems. We thereby obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with a broader class of nonlinearities, and provides (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds.

Title: RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data
Authors: Maxwell A. Xu, Jaya Narain, Gregory Darnell, Haraldur Hallgrimsson, Hyewon Jeong, Darren Forde, Richard Fineman, Karthik J. Raghuram, James M. Rehg, Shirley Ren
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised Relative Contrastive learning approach for training a motion foundation model from wearable accelerometry sensors. First, a learnable distance measure is trained to capture motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. Then, the learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometry time-series, which we use to train our foundation model to model relative relationships across time and across subjects. The foundation model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks, including human activity recognition and gait metric regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a foundation model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.

Title: On trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics
Authors: Thomas Auer, Frank Woittennek
Abstract: An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.

Title: Comprehensive Evaluation of OCT-based Automated Segmentation of Retinal Layer, Fluid and Hyper-Reflective Foci: Impact on Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Assessment
Authors: S. Chen, D. Ma, M. Raviselvan, S. Sundaramoorthy, K. Popuri, M. J. Ju, M. V. Sarunic, D. Ratra, M. F. Beg
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss, requiring early and accurate assessment to prevent irreversible damage. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) enables high-resolution retinal imaging, but automated segmentation performance varies, especially in cases with complex fluid and hyperreflective foci (HRF) patterns. This study proposes an active-learning-based deep learning pipeline for automated segmentation of retinal layers, fluid, and HRF, using four state-of-the-art models: U-Net, SegFormer, SwinUNETR, and VM-UNet, trained on expert-annotated SD-OCT volumes. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation, and retinal thickness was quantified using a K-nearest neighbors algorithm and visualized with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) maps. SwinUNETR achieved the highest overall accuracy (DSC = 0.7719; NSD = 0.8149), while VM-UNet excelled in specific layers. Structural differences were observed between non-proliferative and proliferative DR, with layer-specific thickening correlating with visual acuity impairment. The proposed framework enables robust, clinically relevant DR assessment while reducing the need for manual annotation, supporting improved disease monitoring and treatment planning.

Title: A Modular Edge Device Network for Surgery Digitalization

Abstract: Future surgical care demands real-time, integrated data to drive informed decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.

Title: Insights into the explainability of Lasso-based DeePC for nonlinear systems
Authors: Gianluca Giacomelli, Simone Formentin, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. MÃ¼ller, Valentina Breschi
Abstract: Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has recently gained the spotlight as an easy-to-use control technique that allows for constraint handling while relying on raw data only. Initially proposed for linear time-invariant systems, several DeePC extensions are now available to cope with nonlinear systems. Nonetheless, these solutions mainly focus on ensuring the controller's effectiveness, overlooking the explainability of the final result. As a step toward explaining the outcome of DeePC for the control of nonlinear systems, in this paper, we focus on analyzing the earliest and simplest DeePC approach proposed to cope with nonlinearities in the controlled system, using a Lasso regularization. Our theoretical analysis highlights that the decisions undertaken by DeePC with Lasso regularization are unexplainable, as control actions are determined by data incoherent with the system's local behavior. This result is true even when the available input/output samples are grouped according to the different operating conditions explored during data collection. Our numerical study confirms these findings, highlighting the benefits of data grouping in terms of performance while showing that explainability remains a challenge in control design via DeePC.

Title: Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids with ZIP Loads
Authors: Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control and communication topology co-design approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (DC MGs) with generic ``ZIP'' loads. While ZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its constant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and destabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous voltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and topology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To address these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system comprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected according to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a local controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary topology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked ``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs. Subsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust (dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the dissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and globally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and embed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI problems, thus providing a one-shot approach (as opposed to iterative schemes) to solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper provides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches.

Title: Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.

Title: Secure Communications for All Users in Low-Resolution IRS-aided Systems Under Imperfect and Unknown CSI
Authors: Monir Abughalwa, Diep N. Nguyen, Dinh Thai Hoang, Thang X. Vu, Eryk Dutkiewicz, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity and uncertainty of their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all users where a low resolution intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. In real-life scenarios, due to hardware limitations of the IRS' passive reflective elements (PREs), the use of a full-resolution (continuous) phase shift (CPS) is impractical. In this paper, we thus consider a more practical case where the phase shift (PS) is modeled by a low-resolution (quantized) phase shift (QPS) while addressing the phase shift error (PSE) induced by the imperfect channel state information (CSI). To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming vector and the IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under perfect/imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. To tackle it, we linearize the objective function and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When the perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution with low computational complexity. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure communication for all users while the IRS's PREs are quantized and are affected by the PSE.

Title: "Security for Everyone" in Finite Blocklength IRS-aided Systems With Perfect and Imperfect CSI
Authors: Monir Abughalwa, Diep N. Nguyen, Dinh Thai Hoang, Van-Dinh Nguyen, Ming Zeng, Quoc-Viet Pham, Eryk Dutkiewicz
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity in their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. The problem is even more difficult under finite blocklength constraints that are popular in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all URLLC/mMTC users in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) where intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming and IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under the FBR latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To tackle it, we linearize the objective function, and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI-related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution with low computational complexity thanks to our closed-form linearization approach. This makes the solution scalable for large IRS deployments. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure communication for all users while satisfying FBR constraints even with only imperfect CSI.

Title: A Multi-Modal AI System for Screening Mammography: Integrating 2D and 3D Imaging to Improve Breast Cancer Detection in a Prospective Clinical Study
Authors: Jungkyu Park, Jan Witowski, Yanqi Xu, Hari Trivedi, Judy Gichoya, Beatrice Brown-Mulry, Malte Westerhoff, Linda Moy, Laura Heacock, Alana Lewin, Krzysztof J. Geras
Abstract: Although digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) improves diagnostic performance over full-field digital mammography (FFDM), false-positive recalls remain a concern in breast cancer screening. We developed a multi-modal artificial intelligence system integrating FFDM, synthetic mammography, and DBT to provide breast-level predictions and bounding-box localizations of suspicious findings. Our AI system, trained on approximately 500,000 mammography exams, achieved 0.945 AUROC on an internal test set. It demonstrated capacity to reduce recalls by 31.7% and radiologist workload by 43.8% while maintaining 100% sensitivity, underscoring its potential to improve clinical workflows. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, reducing the gap to a perfect AUROC by 35.31%-69.14% relative to strong baselines. In prospective deployment across 18 sites, the system reduced recall rates for low-risk cases. An improved version, trained on over 750,000 exams with additional labels, further reduced the gap by 18.86%-56.62% across large external datasets. Overall, these results underscore the importance of utilizing all available imaging modalities, demonstrate the potential for clinical impact, and indicate feasibility of further reduction of the test error with increased training set when using large-capacity neural networks.

Title: Robustness of Online Identification-based Policy Iteration to Noisy Data
Authors: Bowen Song, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: This article investigates the core mechanisms of indirect data-driven control for unknown systems, focusing on the application of policy iteration (PI) within the context of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control problem. Specifically, we consider a setting where data is collected sequentially from a linear system subject to exogenous process noise, and is then used to refine estimates of the optimal control policy. We integrate recursive least squares (RLS) for online model estimation within a certainty-equivalent framework, and employ PI to iteratively update the control policy. In this work, we investigate first the convergence behavior of RLS under two different models of adversarial noise, namely point-wise and energy bounded noise, and then we provide a closed-loop analysis of the combined model identification and control design process. This iterative scheme is formulated as an algorithmic dynamical system consisting of the feedback interconnection between two algorithms expressed as discrete-time systems. This system theoretic viewpoint on indirect data-driven control allows us to establish convergence guarantees to the optimal controller in the face of uncertainty caused by noisy data. Simulations illustrate the theoretical results.

Title: Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model
Authors: James P. Wilson, Shalabh Gupta, Thomas A. Wettergren
Abstract: The paper develops a novel motion model, called Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model (GMDM), which extends the Dubins model by considering multiple speeds. While the Dubins model produces time-optimal paths under a constant speed constraint, these paths could be suboptimal if this constraint is relaxed to include multiple speeds. This is because a constant speed results in a large minimum turning radius, thus producing paths with longer maneuvers and larger travel times. In contrast, multi-speed relaxation allows for slower speed sharp turns, thus producing more direct paths with shorter maneuvers and smaller travel times. Furthermore, the inability of the Dubins model to reduce speed could result in fast maneuvers near obstacles, thus producing paths with high collision risks. In this regard, GMDM provides the motion planners the ability to jointly optimize time and risk by allowing the change of speed along the path. GMDM is built upon the six Dubins path types considering the change of speed on path segments. It is theoretically established that GMDM provides full reachability of the configuration space for any speed selections. Furthermore, it is shown that the Dubins model is a specific case of GMDM for constant speeds. The solutions of GMDM are analytical and suitable for real-time applications. The performance of GMDM in terms of solution quality (i.e., time/time-risk cost) and computation time is comparatively evaluated against the existing motion models in obstacle-free as well as obstacle-rich environments via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that in obstacle-free environments, GMDM produces near time-optimal paths with significantly lower travel times than the Dubins model while having similar computation times. In obstacle-rich environments, GMDM produces time-risk optimized paths with substantially lower collision risks.

Title: As Good As A Coin Toss: Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli
Authors: Di Cooke, Abigail Edwards, Sophia Barkoff, Kathryn Kelly
Abstract: One of the current principal defenses against weaponized synthetic media continues to be the ability of the targeted individual to visually or auditorily recognize AI-generated content when they encounter it. However, as the realism of synthetic media continues to rapidly improve, it is vital to have an accurate understanding of just how susceptible people currently are to potentially being misled by convincing but false AI generated content. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how capable people were at distinguishing between authentic and synthetic images, audio, video, and audiovisual media. We find that on average, people struggled to distinguish between synthetic and authentic media, with the mean detection performance close to a chance level performance of 50%. We also find that accuracy rates worsen when the stimuli contain any degree of synthetic content, features foreign languages, and the media type is a single modality. People are also less accurate at identifying synthetic images when they feature human faces, and when audiovisual stimuli have heterogeneous authenticity. Finally, we find that higher degrees of prior knowledgeability about synthetic media does not significantly impact detection accuracy rates, but age does, with older individuals performing worse than their younger counterparts. Collectively, these results highlight that it is no longer feasible to rely on the perceptual capabilities of people to protect themselves against the growing threat of weaponized synthetic media, and that the need for alternative countermeasures is more critical than ever before.

Title: The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy of Risks From Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Peter Slattery, Alexander K. Saeri, Emily A. C. Grundy, Jess Graham, Michael Noetel, Risto Uuk, James Dao, Soroush Pour, Stephen Casper, Neil Thompson
Abstract: The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors & misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.

Title: FireRedTTS: A Foundation Text-To-Speech Framework for Industry-Level Generative Speech Applications
Authors: Hao-Han Guo, Yao Hu, Kun Liu, Fei-Yu Shen, Xu Tang, Yi-Chen Wu, Feng-Long Xie, Kun Xie, Kai-Tuo Xu
Abstract: This work proposes FireRedTTS, a foundation text-to-speech framework, to meet the growing demands for personalized and diverse generative speech applications. The framework comprises three parts: data processing, foundation system, and downstream applications. First, we comprehensively present our data processing pipeline, which transforms massive raw audio into a large-scale high-quality TTS dataset with rich annotations and a wide coverage of content, speaking style, and timbre. Then, we propose a language-model-based foundation TTS system. The speech signal is compressed into discrete semantic tokens via a semantic-aware speech tokenizer, and can be generated by a language model from the prompt text and audio. Then, a two-stage waveform generator is proposed to decode them to the high-fidelity waveform. We present two applications of this system: voice cloning for dubbing and human-like speech generation for chatbots. The experimental results demonstrate the solid in-context learning capability of FireRedTTS, which can stably synthesize high-quality speech consistent with the prompt text and audio. For dubbing, FireRedTTS can clone target voices in a zero-shot way for the UGC scenario and adapt to studio-level expressive voice characters in the PUGC scenario via few-shot fine-tuning with 1-hour recording. Moreover, FireRedTTS achieves controllable human-like speech generation in a casual style with paralinguistic behaviors and emotions via instruction tuning, to better serve spoken chatbots.

Title: Maintaining Strong r-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Haejoon Lee, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: In leader-follower consensus, strong r-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong r-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.

Title: E-3DGS: Gaussian Splatting with Exposure and Motion Events
Authors: Xiaoting Yin, Hao Shi, Yuhan Bao, Zhenshan Bing, Yiyi Liao, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Achieving 3D reconstruction from images captured under optimal conditions has been extensively studied in the vision and imaging fields. However, in real-world scenarios, challenges such as motion blur and insufficient illumination often limit the performance of standard frame-based cameras in delivering high-quality images. To address these limitations, we incorporate a transmittance adjustment device at the hardware level, enabling event cameras to capture both motion and exposure events for diverse 3D reconstruction scenarios. Motion events (triggered by camera or object movement) are collected in fast-motion scenarios when the device is inactive, while exposure events (generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower motion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our framework supports three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events, Fast Reconstruction relying on motion events, and Balanced Hybrid optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. On the EventNeRF dataset, we demonstrate that exposure events significantly improve fine detail reconstruction compared to motion events and outperform frame-based cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination and overexposure. Furthermore, we introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method achieves faster and higher-quality reconstruction than event-based NeRF and is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data. E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands. The source code and dataset will be available at this https URL.

Title: Planning and Learning in Risk-Aware Restless Multi-Arm Bandit Problem
Authors: Nima Akbarzadeh, Yossiri Adulyasak, Erick Delage
Abstract: In restless multi-arm bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless multi-arm bandit problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness. We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and provide a solution based on Whittle index. In addition, we address the learning problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless multi-arm bandits is illustrated through a set of numerical experiments in the contexts of machine replacement and patient scheduling applications under both planning and learning setups.

Title: Auto-Encoded Supervision for Perceptual Image Super-Resolution
Authors: MinKyu Lee, Sangeek Hyun, Woojin Jun, Jae-Pil Heo
Abstract: This work tackles the fidelity objective in the perceptual super-resolution~(SR). Specifically, we address the shortcomings of pixel-level $L_\text{p}$ loss ($\mathcal{L}_\text{pix}$) in the GAN-based SR framework. Since $L_\text{pix}$ is known to have a trade-off relationship against perceptual quality, prior methods often multiply a small scale factor or utilize low-pass filters. However, this work shows that these circumventions fail to address the fundamental factor that induces blurring. Accordingly, we focus on two points: 1) precisely discriminating the subcomponent of $L_\text{pix}$ that contributes to blurring, and 2) only guiding based on the factor that is free from this trade-off relationship. We show that they can be achieved in a surprisingly simple manner, with an Auto-Encoder (AE) pretrained with $L_\text{pix}$. Accordingly, we propose the Auto-Encoded Supervision for Optimal Penalization loss ($L_\text{AESOP}$), a novel loss function that measures distance in the AE space, instead of the raw pixel space. Note that the AE space indicates the space after the decoder, not the bottleneck. By simply substituting $L_\text{pix}$ with $L_\text{AESOP}$, we can provide effective reconstruction guidance without compromising perceptual quality. Designed for simplicity, our method enables easy integration into existing SR frameworks. Experimental results verify that AESOP can lead to favorable results in the perceptual SR task.

Title: Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Yi-Ping Chen, Vispi Karkaria, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Faith Rolark, Daniel Quispe, Robert X. Gao, Jian Cao, Wei Chen
Abstract: Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.

Title: Towards Unified Music Emotion Recognition across Dimensional and Categorical Models
Authors: Jaeyong Kang, Dorien Herremans
Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in Music Emotion Recognition (MER) comes from the fact that emotion labels can be heterogeneous across datasets with regard to the emotion representation, including categorical (e.g., happy, sad) versus dimensional labels (e.g., valence-arousal). In this paper, we present a unified multitask learning framework that combines these two types of labels and is thus able to be trained on multiple datasets. This framework uses an effective input representation that combines musical features (i.e., key and chords) and MERT embeddings. Moreover, knowledge distillation is employed to transfer the knowledge of teacher models trained on individual datasets to a student model, enhancing its ability to generalize across multiple tasks. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including MTG-Jamendo, DEAM, PMEmo, and EmoMusic. According to our experimental results, the inclusion of musical features, multitask learning, and knowledge distillation significantly enhances performance. In particular, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including the best-performing model from the MediaEval 2021 competition on the MTG-Jamendo dataset. Our work makes a significant contribution to MER by allowing the combination of categorical and dimensional emotion labels in one unified framework, thus enabling training across datasets.
