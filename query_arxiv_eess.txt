Title: Comparative Analysis of Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification
Authors: Kunal Kawadkar
Abstract: The emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has revolutionized computer vision, yet their effectiveness compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of CNN and ViT architectures across three critical medical imaging tasks: chest X-ray pneumonia detection, brain tumor classification, and skin cancer melanoma detection. We evaluated four state-of-the-art models - ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Base, and DeiT-Small - across datasets totaling 8,469 medical images. Our results demonstrate task-specific model advantages: ResNet-50 achieved 98.37% accuracy on chest X-ray classification, DeiT-Small excelled at brain tumor detection with 92.16% accuracy, and EfficientNet-B0 led skin cancer classification at 81.84% accuracy. These findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting architectures for medical AI applications, highlighting the importance of task-specific architecture selection in clinical decision support systems.

Title: Querying GI Endoscopy Images: A VQA Approach
Authors: Gaurav Parajuli
Abstract: VQA (Visual Question Answering) combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with image understanding to answer questions about a given image. It has enormous potential for the development of medical diagnostic AI systems. Such a system can help clinicians diagnose gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accurately and efficiently. Although many of the multimodal LLMs available today have excellent VQA capabilities in the general domain, they perform very poorly for VQA tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging. This study is a submission for ImageCLEFmed-MEDVQA-GI 2025 subtask 1 that explores the adaptation of the Florence2 model to answer medical visual questions on GI endoscopy images. We also evaluate the model performance using standard metrics like ROUGE, BLEU and METEOR

Title: Simultaneous improvement of control and estimation for battery management systems
Authors: Mohammad S. Ramadan, Marfred Barrera, Mihai Anitescu, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: The state of charge of battery systems is an important metric typically estimated by observation models, represented by open-circuit voltage graphs. These observation models are often nonlinear in the state of charge, resulting in varying observability from a state estimation perspective. In this paper, we employ a stochastic optimal control (also known as dual control) approach to simultaneously satisfy the control objective in the state of charge of battery systems and improve estimation accuracy. This is achieved implicitly by prioritizing trajectories that pass through high-observability regions of the state space, thereby improving the quality of future measurements. We apply our algorithm to a numerical simulation of a multi-battery system and show a statistical improvement in both the control objective and the state estimation error.

Title: DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB
Authors: Haonan Si, Zhaolin Wang, Xiansheng Guo, Jin Zhang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA) is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the Cram√©r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while maintaining a low computational complexity.

Title: Ensemble Control of Stochastic Oscillators via Periodic and Feedback Control
Authors: Kaito Ito, Haruhiro Kume, Hideaki Ishii
Abstract: We address the problem of steering the phase distribution of oscillators all receiving the same control input to a given target distribution. In a large population limit, the distribution of oscillators can be described by a probability density. Then, our problem can be seen as that of ensemble control with a constraint on the steady-state density. In particular, we consider the case where oscillators are subject to stochastic noise, for which the theoretical understanding is still lacking. First, we characterize the reachability of the phase distribution under periodic feedforward control via the Fourier coefficients of the target density and the phase sensitivity function of oscillators. This enables us to design a periodic input that makes the stationary distribution of oscillators closest to the target by solving a convex optimization problem. Next, we devise an ensemble control method combining periodic and feedback control, where the feedback component is designed to accelerate the convergence of the distribution of oscillators. We exhibit some convergence results for the proposed method, including a result that holds even under measurement errors in the phase distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example.

Title: Real-Time Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Using Pre-trained Visual Representations
Authors: Teng (Aleksandra)Ma, Sile Yin, Li-Chia Yang, Shuo Zhang
Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios. In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE system.

Title: Transmission With Machine Language Tokens: A Paradigm for Task-Oriented Agent Communication
Authors: Zhuoran Xiao, Chenhui Ye, Yijia Feng, Yunbo Hu, Tianyu Jiao, Liyu Cai, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: The rapid advancement in large foundation models is propelling the paradigm shifts across various industries. One significant change is that agents, instead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in the future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native communication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability of large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a potential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language, which is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In this paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system. Specifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine language represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is trained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit information from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine language tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for transmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission overhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that compresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing robustness against channel noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces transmission overhead for downstream tasks while enhancing accuracy relative to the SOTA methods.

Title: Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application
Authors: Daxiang Li, Zhichao Zhang, Wei Yao
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the 1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT), gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However, existing 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical uniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D non-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD), which is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in time-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in practical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical imaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these challenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the 2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT). The 2D NSFRFT has four degrees of freedom, includes the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases, and maintains a more general 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD. We derive its properties and present three discrete algorithms, two of which are fast algorithms with computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$ comparable to that of the 2D SFRFT. Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the 2D NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering, and denoising.

Title: ST-DAI: Single-shot 2.5D Spatial Transcriptomics with Intra-Sample Domain Adaptive Imputation for Cost-efficient 3D Reconstruction
Authors: Jiahe Qian, Yaoyu Fang, Xinkun Wang, Lee A. Cooper, Bo Zhou
Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden.

Title: Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform
Authors: Ziqi Yan, Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: To address limitations of the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) Wiener filtering and the traditional joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRFT) Wiener filtering, this study proposes a filtering method based on the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT. The gradient backpropagation mechanism is employed to enable the adaptive selection of transform order pair and filter coefficients. First, leveraging the hyper-differential form of the GFRFT and the fractional Fourier transform, the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT is constructed and its properties are analyzed. Second, time-varying graph signals are divided into dynamic graph sequences of equal span along the temporal dimension. A spatiotemporal joint representation is then established through vectorized reorganization, followed by the joint time-vertex Wiener filtering. Furthermore, by rigorously proving the differentiability of the transform orders, both the transform orders and filter coefficients are embedded as learnable parameters within a neural network architecture. Through gradient backpropagation, their synchronized iterative optimization is achieved, constructing a parameters-adaptive learning filtering framework. This method leverages a model-driven approach to learn the optimal transform order pair and filter coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework improves the time-varying graph signals denoising performance, while reducing the computational burden of the traditional grid search strategy.

Title: Causal Link Discovery with Unequal Edge Error Tolerance
Authors: Joni Shaska, Urbashi Mitra
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for causal discovery with asymmetric error control, called Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Despite the importance of applications where different types of edge errors may have different importance, current state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms do not differentiate between the types of edge errors, nor provide any finite-sample guarantees on the edge errors. Hence, this framework seeks to minimize one type of error while keeping the other below a user-specified tolerance level. Using techniques from information theory, fundamental performance limits are found, characterized by the R√©nyi divergence, for Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Furthermore, a causal discovery algorithm is introduced for the case of linear additive Gaussian noise models, called epsilon-CUT, that provides finite-sample guarantees on the false positive rate, while staying competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Experimental Implementation and Validation of Predictor-Based CACC for Vehicular Platoons With Distinct Actuation Delays
Authors: Amirhossein Samii, Redmer de Haan, Nikolaos Bekiaris-Liberis
Abstract: We provide experimental validation, in a pair of vehicles, of a recently introduced predictor-based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design, developed for achieving delay compensation in heterogeneous vehicular platoons subject to long actuation delays that may be distinct for each individual vehicle. We provide the explicit formulae of the control design that is implemented, accounting for the effect of zero-order hold and sampled measurements; as well as we obtain vehicle and string stability conditions numerically, via derivation of the transfer functions relating the speeds of pairs of consecutive vehicles. We also present consistent simulation results for a platoon with a larger number of vehicles, under digital implementation of the controller. Both the simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the predictor-based CACC design in guaranteeing individual vehicle stability, string stability, and tracking, despite long/distinct actuation delays.

Title: Affine Invariant Semi-Blind Receiver: Joint Channel Estimation and High-Order Signal Detection for Multiuser Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems
Authors: Erdeng Zhang, Shuntian Zheng, Sheng Wu, Haoge Jia, Zhe Ji, Ailing Xiao
Abstract: Massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are foundational for downlink multi-user (MU) communication in future wireless networks, for their ability to enhance spectral efficiency and support a large number of users simultaneously. However, high user density intensifies severe inter-user interference (IUI) and pilot overhead. Consequently, existing blind and semi-blind channel estimation (CE) and signal detection (SD) algorithms suffer performance degradation and increased complexity, especially when further challenged by frequency-selective channels and high-order modulation demands. To this end, this paper proposes a novel semi-blind joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) method. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid precoding architecture to suppress IUI. Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation fitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are used to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution. For high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the effective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE accuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages improved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain of 11\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the proposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.

Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Behavioral Hardware Impairments in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Uplink: Centralized Operation
Authors: √ñzlem Tuƒüfe Demir, Muhammed Selman Somuncu, Ahmet M. Elbir, Emil Bj√∂rnson
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points (APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining. Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent colored noise.

Title: Impact of Phase Noise and Power Amplifier Non-Linearities on Downlink Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems
Authors: √ñzlem Tuƒüfe Demir, Emil Bj√∂rnson
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key enabler for the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks, offering significant spectral and energy efficiency gains through user-centric operation of distributed access points (APs). However, its reliance on low-cost APs introduces inevitable hardware impairments, whose combined impact on wideband downlink systems remains unexplored when analyzed using behavioral models. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) in cell-free massive MIMO-OFDM systems under practical hardware impairments, including phase noise and third-order power amplifier nonlinearities. Both centralized and distributed precoding strategies are examined. By leveraging the Bussgang decomposition, we derive an SE expression and quantify the relative impact of impairments through simulations. Our results reveal that phase noise causes more severe degradation than power amplifier distortions, especially in distributed operation, highlighting the need for future distortion-aware precoding designs.

Title: Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Operator Cell-Free Massive MIMO in V-CRAN Architectures
Authors: Derya Nurcan-Atceken, √ñzlem Tuƒüfe Demir, Aysegul Altin-Kayhan, Emil Bj√∂rnson, Cicek Cavdar, Bulent Tavli
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.

Title: Deep Neuro-Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller for Higher-Order Heterogeneous Nonlinear Multi-Agent Teams with Leader
Authors: Khushal Chaudhari, Krishanu Nath, Manas Kumar Bera
Abstract: This letter proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-based neuro-adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy for leader-follower tracking in multi-agent systems with higher-order, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and unknown dynamics under external disturbances. The DNN is used to compensate the unknown nonlinear dynamics with higher accuracy than shallow neural networks (NNs) and SMC ensures robust tracking. This framework employs restricted potential functions within a set-theoretic paradigm to ensure system trajectories remain bounded within a compact set, improving robustness against approximation errors and external disturbances. The control scheme is grounded in non-smooth Lyapunov stability theory, with update laws derived for both inner and outer layer network weights of DNN. A numerical example is simulated that showcases the proposed controller's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness.

Title: Data-Driven Greenhouse Climate Regulation in Lettuce Cultivation Using BiLSTM and GRU Predictive Control
Authors: Soumo Emmanuel Arnaud, Marcello Calisti, Athanasios Polydoros
Abstract: Efficient greenhouse management is essential for sustainable food production in response to a growing global population. However, maintaining optimal indoor climates requires significant energy and resources, making advanced control systems critical for economic viability and environmental sustainability. Traditional greenhouse models are often complex and imprecise, limiting the effectiveness of conventional control strategies. To address these challenges, this study investigates data-driven predictive control methods using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Our experiments showed that GRU-based predictive control reduced temperature and humidity violations by up to 5\% and required 40\% less computation time than the LSTM approach, all while maintaining equivalent economic performance and crop yield. These findings demonstrate that GRU-based predictive control offers a more efficient and practical solution for real-time greenhouse climate regulation in precision agriculture.

Title: Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN
Authors: Abdelaziz Salama, Zeinab Nezami, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

Title: EcoFL: Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning in Multi-RAT ORAN Networks
Authors: Abdelaziz Salama, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Syed Danial Ali Shah, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Zaidi, Hamed Ahmadi
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL deployments in wireless networks face significant challenges, including communication overhead, unreliable connectivity, and high energy consumption, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper proposes EcoFL, an integrated FL framework that leverages the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) architecture with multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) to enhance communication efficiency and ensure robust FL operations. EcoFL implements a two-stage optimisation approach: an RL-based rApp for dynamic RAT selection that balances energy efficiency with network performance, and a CNN-based xApp for near real-time resource allocation with adaptive policies. This coordinated approach significantly enhances communication resilience under fluctuating network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate competitive FL model performance with 19\% lower power consumption compared to baseline approaches, highlighting substantial potential for scalable, energy-efficient collaborative learning applications.

Title: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) for 6G: Properties, Features, and Challenges
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Vincent Savaux, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David Gonz√°lez G., Christos Masouros
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.

Title: The impact of large-scale EV charging on the real-time operation of distribution systems: A comprehensive review
Authors: Zhe Yu, Chuang Yang, Qin Wang
Abstract: With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.

Title: Control Copy-Paste: Controllable Diffusion-Based Augmentation Method for Remote Sensing Few-Shot Object Detection
Authors: Yanxing Liu, Jiancheng Pan, Bingchen Zhang
Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) for optical remote sensing images aims to detect rare objects with only a few annotated bounding boxes. The limited training data makes it difficult to represent the data distribution of realistic remote sensing scenes, which results in the notorious overfitting problem. Current researchers have begun to enhance the diversity of few-shot novel instances by leveraging diffusion models to solve the overfitting problem. However, naively increasing the diversity of objects is insufficient, as surrounding contexts also play a crucial role in object detection, and in cases where the object diversity is sufficient, the detector tends to overfit to monotonous contexts. Accordingly, we propose Control Copy-Paste, a controllable diffusion-based method to enhance the performance of FSOD by leveraging diverse contextual information. Specifically, we seamlessly inject a few-shot novel objects into images with diverse contexts by a conditional diffusion model. We also develop an orientation alignment strategy to mitigate the integration distortion caused by varying aspect ratios of instances. Experiments on the public DIOR dataset demonstrate that our method can improve detection performance by an average of 10.76%.

Title: VidFuncta: Towards Generalizable Neural Representations for Ultrasound Videos
Authors: Julia Wolleb, Florentin Bieder, Paul Friedrich, Hemant D. Tagare, Xenophon Papademetris
Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned 1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our code is publicly available under this https URL.

Title: CRB-Rate Tradeoff for Bistatic ISAC with Gaussian Information and Deterministic Sensing Signals
Authors: Xianxin Song, Xianghao Yu, Jie Xu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS), a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive the corresponding Cram√©r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS. When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.

Title: Hierarchical Game-Based Multi-Agent Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Mushuang Liu, Yan Wan, Frank Lewis, Subramanya Nageshrao, H. Eric Tseng, Dimitar Filev
Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic decision-making framework for autonomous driving in multi-agent scenarios. A novel hierarchical game-based decision framework is developed for the ego vehicle. This framework features an interaction graph, which characterizes the interaction relationships between the ego and its surrounding traffic agents (including AVs, human driven vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, and others), and enables the ego to smartly select a limited number of agents as its game players. Compared to the standard multi-player games, where all surrounding agents are considered as game players, the hierarchical game significantly reduces the computational complexity. In addition, compared to pairwise games, the most popular approach in the literature, the hierarchical game promises more efficient decisions for the ego (in terms of less unnecessary waiting and yielding). To further reduce the computational cost, we then propose an improved hierarchical game, which decomposes the hierarchical game into a set of sub-games. Decision safety and efficiency are analyzed in both hierarchical games. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, with an intersection-crossing scenario as a case study.

Title: A Novel Framework for Near-Field Covert Communications with RIS and RSMA
Authors: Atiquzzaman Mondal, Amira Bendaimi, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: This paper explores the near field (NF) covert communication with the aid of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user and the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while suppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS) applies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private and a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive closed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage probability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We formulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS under unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is designed using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex approximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced to further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate, highlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert communication.

Title: Zak-OTFS Based Coded Random Access for Uplink mMTC
Authors: Alessandro Mirri, Venkatesh Khammammetti, Beyza Dabak, Enrico Paolini, Krishna Narayanan, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: This paper proposes a grant-free coded random access (CRA) scheme for uplink massive machine-type communications (mMTC), based on Zak-orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation in the delay-Doppler domain. The scheme is tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from unreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By exploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables accurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive interference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with an OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves significantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density. Extensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the robustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability to future mMTC deployments.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data, leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and 738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models (AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

Title: Planning Persuasive Trajectories Based on a Leader-Follower Game Model
Authors: Chaozhe R. He, Yichen Dong, Nan Li
Abstract: We propose a framework that enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to proactively shape the intentions and behaviors of interacting human drivers. The framework employs a leader-follower game model with an adaptive role mechanism to predict human interaction intentions and behaviors. It then utilizes a branch model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to plan the AV trajectory, persuading the human to adopt the desired intention. The proposed framework is demonstrated in an intersection scenario. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the framework for generating persuasive AV trajectories despite uncertainties.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain. However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios.

Title: Site-Specific Location Calibration and Validation of Ray-Tracing Simulator NYURay at Upper Mid-Band Frequencies
Authors: Mingjun Ying, Dipankar Shakya, Peijie Ma, Guanyue Qian, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins, enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

Adams, Hassan Rayhan AlOmaish, Pranav Rajpurkar
Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex, descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142 non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists. Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal. The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding, while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models in chest CT.

Title: Hyperbolic Embeddings for Order-Aware Classification of Audio Effect Chains
Authors: Aogu Wada, Tomohiko Nakamura, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: Audio effects (AFXs) are essential tools in music production, frequently applied in chains to shape timbre and dynamics. The order of AFXs in a chain plays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when non-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are involved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily focused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To address this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly estimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a neural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and classifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured data more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion property. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and edges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the exponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations, where changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments using guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the proposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Further analysis based on AFX type and chain length highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing AFX order.

Title: Privacy-Preserving AI for Encrypted Medical Imaging: A Framework for Secure Diagnosis and Learning
Authors: Abdullah Al Siam, Sadequzzaman Shohan
Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network (Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility, offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

Title: RATE: An LLM-Powered Retrieval Augmented Generation Technology-Extraction Pipeline
Authors: Karan Mirhosseini, Arya Aftab, Alireza Sheikh
Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678 research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They also offer new insights into emerging trends within the BCI-XR field. The source code is available this https URL

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

Authors: Abderaouf Bahi, Amel Ourici
Abstract: This paper explores the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-optimized energy management system for e-commerce data centers, aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The proposed system leverages DRL algorithms to dynamically manage the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and grid power, adapting to fluctuating energy availability in real time. The study demonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\% reduction in energy costs, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods (28\%) and heuristic approaches (22\%). Additionally, it maintains a low SLA violation rate of 1.5\%, compared to 3.0\% for RL and 4.8\% for heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\% improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\% reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly solution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior performance in balancing multiple objectives. Through rigorous testing and ablation studies, the paper validates the effectiveness of the DRL model's architecture and parameters, offering a robust solution for energy management in data centers. The findings highlight the potential of DRL in advancing energy optimization strategies and addressing sustainability challenges.

Title: Assessment of Quantitative Cyber-Physical Reliability of SCADA Systems in Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (V2G) Capable Smart Grids
Authors: Md Abdul Gaffar
Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services. However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling based on IEEE RTS-79 system data. This work presents how AV2G-based attacks degrade system performance by using Monte Carlo simulations method, highlighting the need for cybersecurity-hardening strategies in smart grid design.

Title: Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems
Authors: Xu Yang, Chenhui Lin, Yue Yang, Qi Wang, Haotian Liu, Haizhou Hua, Wenchuan Wu
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.

Title: OCSVM-Guided Representation Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
Authors: Nicolas Pinon (MYRIAD), Carole Lartizien (MYRIAD)
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world medical imaging applications.

Title: PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs
Authors: Soren Pedersen, Sanyam Jain, Mikkel Chavez, Viktor Ladehoff, Bruna Neves de Freitas, Ruben Pauwels
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature, the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a 5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental imaging.

Title: Fluidically Innervated Lattices Make Versatile and Durable Tactile Sensors
Authors: Annan Zhang, Miguel Flores-Acton, Andy Yu, Anshul Gupta, Maggie Yao, Daniela Rus
Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.

Title: Sliding Mode Control for Uncertain Systems with Time-Varying Delays via Predictor Feedback and Super-Twisting Observer
Authors: Hardy Pinto, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Liu Hsu
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stabilization control strategy for linear time-invariant systems affected by known time-varying measurement delays and matched unknown nonlinear disturbances, which may encompass actuator faults. It is considered that part of the state vector is not available for real-time measurement. To address this, the proposed approach combines an open-loop predictor with a state observer designed using the Super-Twisting Algorithm, aiming to compensate for the delays and estimate the unmeasured state components. Specifically, the nonlinear observer-based framework enables the reconstruction of unmodeled fault signals without assuming that they originate from a known exogenous system, offering robustness against parametric uncertainties. Meanwhile, the predictor forwards the delayed output in time. Subsequently, a sliding mode control law is formulated to enforce an ideal sliding mode and ensure global stabilization, even under a broader class of perturbations, unmodeled disturbances, parametric uncertainties, and delays, owing to the integration of the Super-Twisting observer. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Title: A Deep Learning Automatic Speech Recognition Model for Shona Language
Authors: Leslie Wellington Sirora, Mainford Mutandavari
Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers worldwide.

Title: Distributed Iterative ML and Message Passing for Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Zilu Zhao, Christian Forsch, Laura Cottatellucci, Dirk Slock
Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing (MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.

Title: Projecting the New Body: How Body Image Evolves During Learning to Walk with a Wearable Robot
Authors: I-Chieh Lee, He Huang
Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability, and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal, indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination. However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained, likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

Title: Systolic Array-based Accelerator for State-Space Models
Authors: Shiva Raja, Cansu Demirkiran, Aakash Sarkar, Milos Popovic, Ajay Joshi
Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.

Title: Relationship between objective and subjective perceptual measures of speech in individuals with head and neck cancer
Authors: Bence Mark Halpern, Thomas Tienkamp, Teja Rebernik, Rob J.J.H. van Son, Martijn Wieling, Defne Abur, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: Meaningful speech assessment is vital in clinical phonetics and therapy monitoring. This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset. Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech. Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility, articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant chemoradiation.

Title: Sound Source Localization for Human-Robot Interaction in Outdoor Environments
Authors: Victor Liu, Timothy Du, Jordy Sehn, Jack Collier, Fran√ßois Grondin
Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios. Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within 5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

Title: SpeechFake: A Large-Scale Multilingual Speech Deepfake Dataset Incorporating Cutting-Edge Generation Methods
Authors: Wen Huang, Yanmei Gu, Zhiming Wang, Huijia Zhu, Yanmin Qian
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46 languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity, and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing more robust models for evolving generation techniques.

Title: Capacity-Constrained Continual Learning
Authors: Zheng Wen, Doina Precup, Benjamin Van Roy, Satinder Singh
Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

Title: On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Shoju Enami, Kenji Kashima
Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e., the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Title: Decentralized Modeling of Vehicular Maneuvers and Interactions at Urban Junctions
Authors: Saeed Rahmani, Simeon C. Calvert, Bart van Arem
Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur. Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay, making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.

Title: Adaptive Benders decomposition and enhanced SDDP for multistage stochastic programs with block-separable multistage recourse
Authors: Nicol√≤ Mazzi, Ken Mckinnon, Hongyu Zhang
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to efficiently solve multistage stochastic programs with block separable recourse where each recourse problem is a multistage stochastic program with stage-wise independent uncertainty. The algorithm first decomposes the full problem into a reduced master problem and subproblems using Adaptive Benders decomposition. The subproblems are then solved by an enhanced SDDP. The enhancement includes (1) valid bounds at each iteration, (2) a path exploration rule, (3) cut sharing among subproblems, and (4) guaranteed {\delta}-optimal convergence. The cuts for the subproblems are then shared by calling adaptive oracles. The key contribution of the paper is the first algorithm for solving this class of problems. The algorithm is demonstrated on a power system investment planning problem with multi-timescale uncertainty. The case study results show that (1) the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve this type of problem, (2) deterministic wind modelling underestimate the objective function, and (3) stochastic modelling of wind leads to different investment decisions.

Title: A Graphical Method for Designing Time-Optimal Non-Cartesian Gradient Waveforms
Authors: Rui Luo, Hongzhang Huang, Qinfang Miao, Jian Xu, Peng Hu, Haikun Qi
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges for non-Cartesian MRI is the need of designing time-optimal and hardware-compatible gradient waveforms for the provided $k$-space trajectory. Currently dominant methods either work only for certain trajectories or require significant computation time. In this paper, we aim to develop a fast general method that is able to generate time-optimal gradient waveforms for arbitrary non-Cartesian trajectories satisfying both slew rate and gradient constraints. In the proposed method, the gradient waveform is projected into a space defined by the gradients along the spatial directions, termed as $g$-space. In the constructed $g$-space, the problem of finding the next gradient vector given the current gradient vector under desired slew rate limit and with desired direction is simplified to finding the intersection between a line and a circle. To handle trajectories with increasing curvature, a Forward and Backward Sweep (FBS) strategy is introduced, which ensures the existence of the solution to the above mentioned geometry problem for arbitrary trajectories. Furthermore, trajectory reparameterization is proposed to ensure trajectory fidelity. We compare the proposed method with the previous optimal-control method in simulations and validate its feasibility for real MR acquisitions in phantom and human knee for a wide range of non-Cartesian trajectories. The proposed method enables accurate and fast gradient waveform design, achieving significant reduction in computation time and slew rate overshoot compared to the previous method. The source code will be publicly accessible upon publication of this study.

Title: Beamforming Saturation in Two-Timescale RIS-assisted Communication
Authors: Masoud Sadeghian, Angel Lozano, Gabor Fodor
Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.

Title: Pilot-to-Data Power Ratio in RIS-Assisted Multiantenna Communication
Authors: Masoud Sadeghian, Angel Lozano, Gabor Fodor
Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits, demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.

Abstract: We demonstrate the first SCL-band long-haul transmission using G.654.E-compliant fibre, achieving 100.8 Tb/s (GMI) over 1552 km, despite its 1520 nm cutoff wavelength. Due to the fibre's ultra-low loss and low nonlinearity, the achievable-information-rate with lumped amplification is comparable to that of G.652.D-compliant fibre links with distributed-Raman-amplification.

Title: Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline
Authors: Stefanos Gkikas, Ioannis Kyprakis, Manolis Tsiknakis
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.

Title: Efficient Sub-pixel Motion Compensation in Learned Video Codecs
Authors: Th√©o Ladune, Thomas Leguay, Pierrick Philippe, Gordon Clare, F√©lix Henry
Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs (HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel.

Title: Kernel Modelling of Fading Memory Systems
Authors: Yongkang Huo, Thomas Chaffey, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.

Title: Collision Avoidance for Convex Primitives via Differentiable Optimization Based High-Order Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shiqing Wei, Rooholla Khorrambakht, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Vinicius Mariano Gon√ßalves, Farshad Khorrami
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of dynamical systems is crucial, where collision avoidance is a primary concern. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.

Title: Receding Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural Control and State Estimation for Closed-Loop Dynamical Systems
Authors: Josue N. Rivera, Dengfeng Sun
Abstract: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model-predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and develop an optimal control strategy using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework, along with our Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture, allows for custom transient behavior, predictive control, and closed-loop feedback, addressing limitations of existing methods. Comparative analyses with established model-predictive controllers revealed Hion controllers' superior optimality and tracking capabilities. Optimal control strategies are also demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.

Title: Joint Multitarget Detection and Tracking with mmWave Radar
Authors: Jiang Zhu, Menghuai Xu, Ruohai Guo, Fangyong Wang, Guangying Zheng, Fengzhong Qu
Abstract: Accurate targets detection and tracking with mmWave radar is a key sensing capability that will enable more intelligent systems, create smart, efficient, automated system. This paper proposes an end-to-end detection-estimation-track framework named MNOMP-SPA-KF consisting of the target detection and estimation module, the data association (DA) module and the target tracking module. In the target estimation and detection module, a low complexity, super-resolution and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) based two dimensional multisnapshot Newtonalized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-MNOMP) is designed to extract the multitarget's radial distances and velocities, followed by the conventional (Bartlett) beamformer to extract the multitarget's azimuths. In the DA module, a sum product algorithm (SPA) is adopted to obtain the association probabilities of the existed targets and measurements by incorporating the radial velocity information. The Kalman filter (KF) is implemented to perform target tracking in the target tracking module by exploiting the asymptotic distribution of the estimators. To improve the detection probability of the weak targets, extrapolation is also coupled into the MNOMP-SPA-KF. Numerical and real data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MNOMP-SPA-KF algorithm, compared to other benchmark algorithms.

Title: Faster-Than-Nyquist Equalization with Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Bruno De Filippo, Carla Amatetti, Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling aims at improving the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems by exceeding the boundaries set by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. 50 years after its first introduction in the scientific literature, wireless communications have significantly changed, but spectral efficiency remains one of the key challenges. To adopt FTN signaling, inter-symbol interference (ISI) patterns need to be equalized at the receiver. Motivated by the pattern recognition capabilities of convolutional neural networks with skip connections, we propose such deep learning architecture for ISI equalization and symbol demodulation in FTN receivers. We investigate the performance of the proposed model considering quadrature phase shift keying modulation and low density parity check coding, and compare it to a set of benchmarks, including frequency-domain equalization, a quadratic-programming-based receiver, and an equalization scheme based on a deep neural network. We show that our receiver outperforms any benchmark, achieving error rates comparable to those in additive white Gaussian noise channel, and higher effective throughput, thanks to the increased spectral efficiency of FTN signaling. With a compression factor of 60% and code rate 3/4, the proposed model achieves a peak effective throughput of 2.5 Mbps at just 10dB of energy per bit over noise power spectral density ratio, with other receivers being limited by error floors due to the strong inter-symbol interference. To promote reproducibility in deep learning for wireless communications, our code is open source at the repository provided in the references.

Title: Instantaneous Core Loss -- Cycle-by-cycle Modeling of Power Magnetics in PWM DC-AC Converters
Authors: Binyu Cui, Jun Wang, Xibo Yuan, Alfonso Martinez, George Slama, Matthew Wilkowski, Ryosuke Ota, Keiji Wada
Abstract: Nowadays, PWM excitation is one of the most common waveforms seen by magnetic components in power electronic converters. Core loss modelling approaches such as improved Generalized Steinmetz equation (iGSE) or the loss map based on composite waveform hypothesis (CWH) process the PWM excitation piecewisely, which is proven to be effective for DC DC converters. As the additional challenge in PWM DC AC converters, the fundamental-frequency sinewave component induces the "major loop loss" on top of the piecewise high-frequency segments, which however cannot be modelled on a switching cycle basis by any existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fundamental concept, instantaneous core loss, which is the time-domain core loss observed experimentally for the first time in history. Extending the reactive voltage cancellation concept, this work presents a method to measure the instantaneous core loss, which only contains real power loss, as a function of time. Based on measurements in evaluated soft magnetic components, it was discovered that the discharging stage exhibits higher core loss than the charging stage. A modelling approach is then proposed to break down the major loop core loss, typically an average value in the literature, into the time domain to enable cycle-by-cycle modelling of core losses in PWM converters. This work enhances the fundamental understanding of the core loss process by moving from the average model to the time-domain model.

Title: Advancing Brainwave-Based Biometrics: A Large-Scale, Multi-Session Evaluation
Authors: Matin Fallahi, Patricia Arias-Cabarcos, Thorsten Strufe
Abstract: The field of brainwave-based biometrics has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize user authentication through hands-free interaction, resistance to shoulder surfing, continuous authentication, and revocability. However, current research often relies on single-session or limited-session datasets with fewer than 55 subjects, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study using a public brainwave dataset comprising 345 subjects and over 6,007 sessions (an average of 17 per subject) recorded over five years using three headsets. Our results reveal that deep learning approaches significantly outperform hand-crafted feature extraction methods. We also observe Equal Error Rates (EER) increases over time (e.g., from 6.7% after 1 day to 14.3% after a year). Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the enrollment set after successful login attempts. Moreover, we demonstrate that fewer brainwave measurement sensors can be used, with an acceptable increase in EER, which is necessary for transitioning from medical-grade to affordable consumer-grade devices. Finally, we compared our results to prior work and existing biometric standards. While our performance is on par with or exceeds previous approaches, it still falls short of industrial benchmarks. Based on the results, we hypothesize that further improvements are possible with larger training sets. To support future research, we have open-sourced our analysis code.

Title: G$^{2}$SF-MIAD: Geometry-Guided Score Fusion for Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection
Authors: Chengyu Tao, Xuanming Cao, Juan Du
Abstract: Industrial quality inspection plays a critical role in modern manufacturing by identifying defective products during production. While single-modality approaches using either 3D point clouds or 2D RGB images suffer from information incompleteness, multimodal anomaly detection offers promise through the complementary fusion of crossmodal data. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively integrating unimodal results and improving discriminative power. To address these limitations, we first reinterpret memory bank-based anomaly scores in single modalities as isotropic Euclidean distances in local feature spaces. Dynamically evolving from Euclidean metrics, we propose a novel \underline{G}eometry-\underline{G}uided \underline{S}core \underline{F}usion (G$^{2}$SF) framework that progressively learns an anisotropic local distance metric as a unified score for the fusion task. Through a geometric encoding operator, a novel Local Scale Prediction Network (LSPN) is proposed to predict direction-aware scaling factors that characterize first-order local feature distributions, thereby enhancing discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Additionally, we develop specialized loss functions and score aggregation strategy from geometric priors to ensure both metric generalization and efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of our method, and detailed ablation analysis validates each component's contribution. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Probabilistically safe and efficient model-based reinforcement learning
Authors: Filippo Airaldi, Bart De Schutter, Azita Dabiri
Abstract: This paper proposes tackling safety-critical stochastic Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks with a sample-based, model-based approach. At the core of the method lies a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that acts as function approximation, providing a model-based predictive control policy. To ensure safety, a probabilistic Control Barrier Function (CBF) is integrated into the MPC controller. To approximate the effects of stochasticies in the optimal control formulation and to fulfil the probabilistic CBF condition, a sample-based approach with guarantees is employed. Furthermore, to counterbalance the additional computational burden due to sampling, a learnable terminal cost formulation is included in the MPC objective. An RL algorithm is deployed to learn both the terminal cost and the CBF constraint. Results from a numerical experiment on a constrained LTI problem corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in reducing computation time while preserving control performance and safety.

Title: Unifying Direct and Indirect Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Amir Modares, Niyousha Ghiasi, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper develops learning-enabled safe controllers for linear systems subject to system uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Given the disturbance zonotope, the databased closed-loop dynamics (CLDs) are first characterized using a matrix zonotope (MZ), and refined through several steps to yield a constrained matrix zonotope (CMZ). This refinement is achieved by introducing conformal equality constraints that eliminate incompatible disturbance realizations. More precisely, prior knowledge and observed data are used separately to construct CMZ representations of disturbance sequences that conform to both data and prior knowledge, and are intersected by the initial MZ of the disturbance sequence, producing a refined CMZ. This approach reduces conservatism. To further reduce the conservativeness, we unify open-loop learning with closed-loop learning by presenting a novel set-membership identification method that models open-loop dynamics as a CMZ. The prior knowledge serves as an initial feasible open-loop model set (FOLMS) of this CMZ, which is refined into a posterior set whenever new informative online data becomes available. This posterior FOLMS then adaptively replaces the prior knowledge set employed in the disturbance elimination of the closed-loop learning process. The resulting refined parameterized set of CLD is subsequently leveraged to directly and adaptively learn a controller that robustly enforces safety. Toward this goal, we formulate a linear programming problem that guarantees {\lambda}contractiveness of a polyhedral safe set. A simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and support the theoretical results.

Title: A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC
Authors: Enrico Testi, Enrico Paolini
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns, drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained applications.

Title: On the Feasibility of Distributed Phase Synchronization for Coherent Signal Superposition
Authors: Alphan Sahin
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the feasibility of distributed phase synchronization for coherent signal superposition, a fundamental enabler for paradigms such as coherent over-the-air computation (OAC), distributed beamforming, and interference alignment, under mobility and hardware impairments. With the focus on coherent OAC, we introduce phase-coded pilots (PCPs), a strategy where the radios communicate with each other to eliminate the round-trip phase change in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) to align the phase of the received symbol at a desired angle. In this study, considering a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the statistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency degrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the duration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of mobility and the number of nodes in the network. We also provide a proof-of-concept demonstration for coherent signal superposition by using off-the-shelf radios to demonstrate the feasibility of PCPs in practice.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.

Title: Efficacy of Image Similarity as a Metric for Augmenting Small Dataset Retinal Image Segmentation
Authors: Thomas Wallace, Ik Siong Heng, Senad Subasic, Chris Messenger
Abstract: Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.

Title: On Purely Data-Driven Massive MIMO Detectors
Authors: Hao Ye, Le Liang
Abstract: The development of learning-based detectors for massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems has been hindered by the inherent complexities arising from the problem's high dimensionality. To enhance scalability, most previous studies have adopted model-driven methodologies that integrate deep neural networks (DNNs) within existing iterative detection frameworks. However, these methods often lack flexibility and involve substantial computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce ChannelNet, a purely data-driven learning-based massive MIMO detector that overcomes these limitations. ChannelNet exploits the inherent symmetry of MIMO systems by incorporating channel-embedded layers and antenna-wise shared feature processors. These modules maintain equivariance to antenna permutations and enable ChannelNet to scale efficiently to large numbers of antennas and high modulation orders with low computational complexity, specifically $\mathcal{O}(N_t N_r)$, where $N_t$ and $N_r$ denote the numbers of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. Theoretically, ChannelNet can approximate any continuous permutation-symmetric function and the optimal maximum likelihood detection (ML) function with arbitrary precision under any continuous channel distribution. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ChannelNet consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art detectors across different numbers of antennas, modulation schemes, and channel distributions, all while significantly reducing computational overhead. This study highlights the potential of purely data-driven designs in advancing efficient and scalable detectors for massive MIMO systems.

Title: End-to-End Energy Saving in Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC for Ultra-Reliable Target-Aware Actuation
Authors: Zinat Behdad, √ñzlem Tuƒüfe Demir, Ki Won Sung, Cicek Cavdar
Abstract: Ultra-reliable target-aware actuation-where timely and accurate sensing information is used to trigger critical actions in emerging 6G sensing-based applications-demands tight integration of sensing and communication under stringent reliability and latency constraints. This paper investigates integrated sensing and communication(ISAC)in a downlink CF-mMIMO system supporting multi-static sensing and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). We propose a joint power and blocklength allocation algorithm to minimize the E2E energy consumption while meeting communication and sensing requirements.E2E energy consumption includes transmission, sensing receivers, and processing for both sensing and communication. The non-convex optimization problem is solved using a combination of FPP-SCA, concave-convex programming (CCP), and fractional programming techniques. We consider two types of target detectors:clutter-aware and clutter-unaware, each with distinct complexity and performance trade-offs.A computational complexity analysis based on giga-operations per second (GOPS) is conducted to quantify the processing requirements of communication and sensing tasks. We perform a comprehensive performance evaluation under various communication and sensing requirements, and benchmark our approach against two alternatives: one minimizing only transmission energy for ISAC and one minimizing E2E energy only for URLLC without sensing integration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced detection capability with less E2E energy consumption. Additionally, we examine the trade-offs between detector complexity, the number of antenna elements per access point(AP), and the number of sensing APs. Clutter-aware detectors, although more complex, require fewer antennas and sensing receive APs to meet detection requirements, thus yielding up to 40% energy savings.

Title: Nonparametric Sparse Online Learning of the Koopman Operator
Authors: Boya Hou, Sina Sanjari, Nathan Dahlin, Alec Koppel, Subhonmesh Bose
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. However, existing data-driven approaches to learning the Koopman operator rely on batch data. In this work, we present a sparse online learning algorithm that learns the Koopman operator iteratively via stochastic approximation, with explicit control over model complexity and provable convergence guarantees. Specifically, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and address the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen RKHS. In this mis-specified setting, we relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator. We further establish both asymptotic and finite-time convergence guarantees for our learning algorithm in mis-specified setting, with trajectory-based sampling where the data arrive sequentially over time. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to learn unknown nonlinear dynamics.

Title: Multi-Microphone and Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition in Reverberant Environment
Authors: Ohad Cohen, Gershon Hazan, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-modal Emotion Recognition (MER) system designed to enhance emotion recognition accuracy in challenging acoustic conditions. Our approach combines a modified and extended Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT) for multi-channel audio processing with an R(2+1)D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for video analysis. We evaluate our proposed method on a reverberated version of the Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) dataset using synthetic and real-world Room Impulse Responsess (RIRs). Our results demonstrate that integrating audio and video modalities yields superior performance compared to uni-modal approaches, especially in challenging acoustic conditions. Moreover, we show that the multimodal (audiovisual) approach that utilizes multiple microphones outperforms its single-microphone counterpart.

Title: Very High-Resolution Bridge Deformation Monitoring Using UAV-based Photogrammetry
Authors: Mehdi Maboudi, Jan Backhaus, Inka Mai, Yahya Ghassoun, Yogesh Khedar, Dirk Lowke, Bjoern Riedel, Ulf Bestmann, Markus Gerke
Abstract: Accurate and efficient structural health monitoring of infrastructure objects such as bridges is a vital task, as many existing constructions have already reached or are approaching their planned service life. In this contribution, we address the question of the suitability of UAV-based monitoring for SHM, in particular focusing on the geometric deformation under load. Such an advanced technology is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to decrease the cost and risk of tedious traditional inspection methods. To this end, we performed extensive tests employing a research reinforced concrete bridge that can be exposed to a predefined load via ground anchors. Very high-resolution image blocks have been captured before, during, and after the application of controlled loads. From those images, the motion of distinct points on the bridge has been monitored, and in addition, dense image point clouds were computed to evaluate the performance of surface-based data acquisition. Moreover, a geodetic control network in stable regions is used as control information for bundle adjustment. We applied different sensing technologies in order to be able to judge the image-based deformation results: displacement transducers, tachymetry, and laser profiling. As a platform for the photogrammetric measurements, a multi-rotor UAV DJI Matrice 600 Pro was employed, equipped with two RTK-GNSS receivers. The mounted camera was a PhaseOne iXM-100 (100MP) with an 80 mm lens. With a flying height of 30 m above the terrain, this resulted in a GSD of 1.3 mm while a forward and sideward overlap of 80% was maintained. The comparison with reference data (displacement transducers) reveals a difference of less than 1 mm. We show that by employing the introduced UAV-based monitoring approach, a full area-wide quantification of deformation is possible in contrast to classical point or profile measurements.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are projected to significantly augment the manual workforce, especially in repetitive and hazardous tasks. For a successful deployment of such robots in human environments, it is crucial to guarantee human safety. State-of-the-art approaches to ensure human safety are either too conservative to permit a natural human-robot collaboration or make strong assumptions that do not hold for autonomous robots, e.g., knowledge of a pre-defined trajectory. Therefore, we propose the shield for Safe Autonomous human-robot collaboration through Reachability Analysis (SARA shield). This novel power and force limiting framework provides formal safety guarantees for manipulation in human environments while realizing fast robot speeds. As unconstrained contacts allow for significantly higher contact forces than constrained contacts (also known as clamping), we use reachability analysis to classify potential contacts by their type in a formally correct way. For each contact type, we formally verify that the kinetic energy of the robot is below pain and injury thresholds for the respective human body part in contact. Our experiments show that SARA shield satisfies the contact safety constraints while significantly improving the robot performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation
Authors: Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao
Abstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

Title: Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Yizhuo Li, Jiakang Zheng, Bokai Xu, Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.

Title: V2M4: 4D Mesh Animation Reconstruction from a Single Monocular Video
Authors: Jianqi Chen, Biao Zhang, Xiangjun Tang, Peter Wonka
Abstract: We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method. Project page: this https URL.

Title: EEG-CLIP : Learning EEG representations from natural language descriptions
Authors: Tidiane Camaret Ndir, Robin Tibor Schirrmeister, Tonio Ball
Abstract: Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples.

Title: Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather Uncertainty
Authors: Sebastian Kebrich, Felix Engelhardt, David Franzmann, Christina B√ºsing, Jochen Lin√üen, Heidi Heinrichs
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.

Title: LLAMAPIE: Proactive In-Ear Conversation Assistants
Authors: Tuochao Chen, Nicholas Batchelder, Alisa Liu, Noah Smith, Shyamnath Gollakota
Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.

Title: Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering
Authors: Yizhe Cheng, Chunxun Tian, Haoru Wang, Wentao Zhu, Xiaoxuan Ma, Yizhou Wang
Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Title: Audio Flamingo 3: Advancing Audio Intelligence with Fully Open Large Audio Language Models
Authors: Arushi Goel, Sreyan Ghosh, Jaehyeon Kim, Sonal Kumar, Zhifeng Kong, Sang-gil Lee, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro
Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech, sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3 modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking, allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering; (iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning (including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL, AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger datasets.

Title: TolerantECG: A Foundation Model for Imperfect Electrocardiogram
Authors: Huynh Dang Nguyen, Trong-Thang Pham, Ngan Le, Van Nguyen
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Title: Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications
Authors: Amit Levy, Itzik Klein
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.

Title: Music-Aligned Holistic 3D Dance Generation via Hierarchical Motion Modeling
Authors: Xiaojie Li, Ronghui Li, Shukai Fang, Shuzhao Xie, Xiaoyang Guo, Jiaqing Zhou, Junkun Peng, Zhi Wang
Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences.
