Title: Display Field-Of-View Agnostic Robust CT Kernel Synthesis Using Model-Based Deep Learning
Authors: Hemant Kumar Aggarwal, Antony Jerald, Phaneendra K. Yalavarthy, Rajesh Langoju, Bipul Das
Abstract: In X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, the choice of reconstruction kernel is crucial as it significantly impacts the quality of clinical images. Different kernels influence spatial resolution, image noise, and contrast in various ways. Clinical applications involving lung imaging often require images reconstructed with both soft and sharp kernels. The reconstruction of images with different kernels requires raw sinogram data and storing images for all kernels increases processing time and storage requirements. The Display Field-of-View (DFOV) adds complexity to kernel synthesis, as data acquired at different DFOVs exhibit varying levels of sharpness and details. This work introduces an efficient, DFOV-agnostic solution for image-based kernel synthesis using model-based deep learning. The proposed method explicitly integrates CT kernel and DFOV characteristics into the forward model. Experimental results on clinical data, along with quantitative analysis of the estimated modulation transfer function using wire phantom data, clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in real-time. Additionally, a comparative study with a direct learning network, that lacks forward model information, shows that the proposed method is more robust to DFOV variations.

Title: Distributed U-net model and Image Segmentation for Lung Cancer Detection
Authors: Tianzuo Hu
Abstract: Until now, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, lung diseases, especially diseases such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have become an urgent global health issue. In order to mitigate the goal problem, early detection and accurate diagnosis of these conditions are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. To further research and reduce the error rate of hospital diagnoses, this comprehensive study explored the potential of computer-aided design (CAD) systems, especially utilizing advanced deep learning models such as U-Net. And compared with the literature content of other authors, this study explores the capabilities of U-Net in detail, and enhances the ability to simulate CAD systems through the VGG16 algorithm. An extensive dataset consisting of lung CT images and corresponding segmentation masks, curated collaboratively by multiple academic institutions, serves as the basis for empirical validation. In this paper, the efficiency of U-Net model is evaluated rigorously and precisely under multiple hardware configurations, such as single CPU, single GPU, distributed GPU and federated learning, and the effectiveness and development of the method in the segmentation task of lung disease are demonstrated. Empirical results clearly affirm the robust performance of the U-Net model, most effectively utilizing four GPUs for distributed learning, and these results highlight the potential of U-Net-based CAD systems for accurate and timely lung disease detection and diagnosis huge potential.

Title: Denoising, segmentation and volumetric rendering of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) image using deep learning techniques: a review
Authors: Kejie Chen, Xiaochun Yang, Jing Na, Wenbo Wang
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used to study vascular structures and micro-circulation dynamics in the retina and choroid. OCTA has been widely used in clinics for diagnosing ocular disease and monitoring its progression, because OCTA is safer and faster than dye-based angiography while retaining the ability to characterize micro-scale structures. However, OCTA data contains many inherent noises from the devices and acquisition protocols and suffers from various types of artifacts, which impairs diagnostic accuracy and repeatability. Deep learning (DL) based imaging analysis models are able to automatically detect and remove artifacts and noises, and enhance the quality of image data. It is also a powerful tool for segmentation and identification of normal and pathological structures in the images. Thus, the value of OCTA imaging can be significantly enhanced by the DL-based approaches for interpreting and performing measurements and predictions on the OCTA data. In this study, we reviewed literature on the DL models for OCTA images in the latest five years. In particular, we focused on discussing the current problems in the OCTA data and the corresponding design principles of the DL models. We also reviewed the state-of-art DL models for 3D volumetric reconstruction of the vascular networks and pathological structures such as the edema and distorted optic disc. In addition, the publicly available dataset of OCTA images are summarized at the end of this review. Overall, this review can provide valuable insights for engineers to develop novel DL models by utilizing the characteristics of OCTA signals and images. The pros and cons of each DL methods and their applications discussed in this review can be helpful to assist technicians and clinicians to use proper DL models for fundamental research and disease screening.

Title: Compact Latent Representation for Image Compression (CLRIC)
Authors: Ayman A. Ameen, Thomas Richter, André Kaup
Abstract: Current image compression models often require separate models for each quality level, making them resource-intensive in terms of both training and storage. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes latent variables from pre-existing trained models (such as the Stable Diffusion Variational Autoencoder) for perceptual image compression. Our method eliminates the need for distinct models dedicated to different quality levels. We employ overfitted learnable functions to compress the latent representation from the target model at any desired quality level. These overfitted functions operate in the latent space, ensuring low computational complexity, around $25.5$ MAC/pixel for a forward pass on images with dimensions $(1363 \times 2048)$ pixels. This approach efficiently utilizes resources during both training and decoding. Our method achieves comparable perceptual quality to state-of-the-art learned image compression models while being both model-agnostic and resolution-agnostic. This opens up new possibilities for the development of innovative image compression methods.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Ultrasound Image Analysis A Comprehensive Review of Advances and Applications
Authors: Maha Ezzelarab, Midhila Madhusoodanan, Shrimanti Ghosh, Geetika Vadali, Jacob Jaremko, Abhilash Hareendranathan
Abstract: Over the last decade, the use of machine learning (ML) approaches in medicinal applications has increased manifold. Most of these approaches are based on deep learning, which aims to learn representations from grid data (like medical images). However, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in medicine are relatively less explored. Medical applications often involve a sequence of subtasks that form a diagnostic pipeline, and RL is uniquely suited to optimize over such sequential decision-making tasks. Ultrasound (US) image analysis is a quintessential example of such a sequential decision-making task, where the raw signal captured by the US transducer undergoes a series of signal processing and image post-processing steps, generally leading to a diagnostic suggestion. The application of RL in US remains limited. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), that combines deep learning and RL, holds great promise in optimizing these pipelines by enabling intelligent and sequential decision-making. This review paper surveys the applications of RL in US over the last decade. We provide a succinct overview of the theoretic framework of RL and its application in US image processing and review existing work in each aspect of the image analysis pipeline. A comprehensive search of Scopus filtered on relevance yielded 14 papers most relevant to this topic. These papers were further categorized based on their target applications image classification, image segmentation, image enhancement, video summarization, and auto navigation and path planning. We also examined the type of RL approach used in each publication. Finally, we discuss key areas in healthcare where DRL approaches in US could be used for sequential decision-making. We analyze the opportunities, challenges, and limitations, providing insights into the future potential of DRL in US image analysis.

Title: Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and feasibility in control systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Existing CBF-based Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) often encounter feasibility issues due to mixed relative degree constraints, input nullification problems, and the presence of tight or time-varying control bounds, which can lead to infeasible solutions and compromised safety. To address these challenges, we propose Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (AVCBFs), a novel framework that introduces auxiliary functions to dynamically adjust CBF constraints without the need of excessive additional constraints. The AVCBF method ensures that all components of the control input explicitly appear in the desired-order safety constraint, thereby improving feasibility while maintaining safety guarantees. Additionally, we introduce an automatic tuning method that iteratively adjusts AVCBF hyperparameters to ensure feasibility and safety with less conservatism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive cruise control and obstacle avoidance scenarios, showing that AVCBFs outperform existing CBF methods by reducing infeasibility and enhancing adaptive safety control under tight or time-varying control bounds.

Title: Optimized Pap Smear Image Enhancement: Hybrid PMD Filter-CLAHE Using Spider Monkey Optimization
Authors: Ach Khozaimi, Isnani Darti, Syaiful Anam, Wuryansari Muharini Kusumawinahyu
Abstract: Pap smear image quality is crucial for cervical cancer detection. This study introduces an optimized hybrid approach that combines the Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) filter with contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to enhance Pap smear image quality. The PMD filter reduces the image noise, whereas CLAHE improves the image contrast. The hybrid method was optimized using spider monkey optimization (SMO PMD-CLAHE). BRISQUE and CEIQ are the new objective functions for the PMD filter and CLAHE optimization, respectively. The simulations were conducted using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The results indicate that SMO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the PMD filter and CLAHE. The proposed method achieved an average effective measure of enhancement (EME) of 5.45, root mean square (RMS) contrast of 60.45, Michelson's contrast (MC) of 0.995, and entropy of 6.80. This approach offers a new perspective for improving Pap smear image quality.

Title: FD-LSCIC: Frequency Decomposition-based Learned Screen Content Image Compression
Authors: Shiqi Jiang, Hui Yuan, Shuai Li, Huanqiang Zeng, Sam Kwong
Abstract: The learned image compression (LIC) methods have already surpassed traditional techniques in compressing natural scene (NS) images. However, directly applying these methods to screen content (SC) images, which possess distinct characteristics such as sharp edges, repetitive patterns, embedded text and graphics, yields suboptimal results. This paper addresses three key challenges in SC image compression: learning compact latent features, adapting quantization step sizes, and the lack of large SC datasets. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel compression method that employs a multi-frequency two-stage octave residual block (MToRB) for feature extraction, a cascaded triple-scale feature fusion residual block (CTSFRB) for multi-scale feature integration and a multi-frequency context interaction module (MFCIM) to reduce inter-frequency correlations. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive quantization module that learns scaled uniform noise for each frequency component, enabling flexible control over quantization granularity. Furthermore, we construct a large SC image compression dataset (SDU-SCICD10K), which includes over 10,000 images spanning basic SC images, computer-rendered images, and mixed NS and SC images from both PC and mobile platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves SC image compression performance, outperforming traditional standards and state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM).

Title: Enhancing Speech Large Language Models with Prompt-Aware Mixture of Audio Encoders
Authors: Weiqiao Shan, Yuang Li, Yuhao Zhang, Yingfeng Luo, Chen Xu, Xiaofeng Zhao, Long Meng, Yunfei Lu, Min Zhang, Hao Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu
Abstract: Connecting audio encoders with large language models (LLMs) allows the LLM to perform various audio understanding tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio captioning (AC). Most research focuses on training an adapter layer to generate a unified audio feature for the LLM. However, different tasks may require distinct features that emphasize either semantic or acoustic aspects, making task-specific audio features more desirable. In this paper, we propose Prompt-aware Mixture (PaM) to enhance the Speech LLM that uses multiple audio encoders. Our approach involves using different experts to extract different features based on the prompt that indicates different tasks. Experiments demonstrate that with PaM, only one Speech LLM surpasses the best performances achieved by all single-encoder Speech LLMs on ASR, Speaker Number Verification, and AC tasks. PaM also outperforms other feature fusion baselines, such as concatenation and averaging.

Title: LUMINA-Net: Low-light Upgrade through Multi-stage Illumination and Noise Adaptation Network for Image Enhancement
Authors: Namrah Siddiqua, Kim Suneung
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial task in computer vision aimed to enhance the visual fidelity of images captured under low-illumination conditions. Conventional methods frequently struggle to mitigate pervasive shortcomings such as noise, over-exposure, and color distortion thereby precipitating a pronounced degradation in image quality. To address these challenges, we propose LUMINA-Net an advanced deep learning framework designed specifically by integrating multi-stage illumination and reflectance modules. First, the illumination module intelligently adjusts brightness and contrast levels while meticulously preserving intricate textural details. Second, the reflectance module incorporates a noise reduction mechanism that leverages spatial attention and channel-wise feature refinement to mitigate noise contamination. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments conducted on LOL and SICE datasets using PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS metrics, surpassing state-of-the-art methodologies and showcasing its efficacy in low-light image enhancement.

Title: Optimised Design of a Current Mirror in 150 nm GaAs Technology
Authors: Lua Ying Qian, Chia Chao Kang, Tan Jian Ding, Mohammad Arif Sobhan Bhuiyan, Khairun Nisa Minhad, Mahdi H. Miraz
Abstract: The Current Mirror (CM) is a basic building block commonly used in analogue and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Its significance lies in its ability to replicate and precisely regulate the current, making it crucial in various applications such as amplifiers, filters and data converters. Recently, there has been a growing need for smaller and more energy-efficient Radio Frequency (RF) devices due to the advancements in wireless communication, the Internet of Things (IoT) and portable electronics. This research aims to propose an improved and optimised CM design focusing on compactness and energy-efficient operation. Through a comprehensive methodology involving transistor sizing, biasing techniques, load resistance selection, frequency response stabilisation and noise analysis, the proposed high swing CM design achieves a gain of at least 6.005 dB, a reduced power consumption of 91.17 mW, a wide bandwidth of 22.60 kHz and improved linearity as well as accuracy through precise current matching and minimised mismatch. This optimised CM design will further boost the realisation of compact and lower power RF devices, contributing to the advancement of analogue circuit design techniques and enhancing system performance, accuracy and reliability.

Title: Interleaved Block-based Learned Image Compression with Feature Enhancement and Quantization Error Compensation
Authors: Shiqi Jiang, Hui Yuan, Shuai Li, Raouf Hamzaoui, Xu Wang, Junyan Huo
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression (LIC) methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, obtaining a more compact latent representation and reducing the impact of quantization errors remain key challenges in the field of LIC. To address these challenges, we propose a feature extraction module, a feature refinement module, and a feature enhancement module. Our feature extraction module shuffles the pixels in the image, splits the resulting image into sub-images, and extracts coarse features from the sub-images. Our feature refinement module stacks the coarse features and uses an attention refinement block composed of concatenated three-dimensional convolution residual blocks to learn more compact latent features by exploiting correlations across channels, within sub-images (intra-sub-image correlations), and across sub-images (inter-sub-image correlations). Our feature enhancement module reduces information loss in the decoded features following quantization. We also propose a quantization error compensation module that mitigates the quantization mismatch between training and testing. Our four modules can be readily integrated into state-of-the-art LIC methods. Experiments show that combining our modules with Tiny-LIC outperforms existing LIC methods and image compression standards in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) on the Kodak dataset and the CLIC dataset.

Title: Discrete implementations of sliding-mode controllers with barrier-function adaptations require a revised framework
Authors: Luis Ovalle, Andrés González, Leonid Fridman, Hernan Haimovich
Abstract: Challenges in the discrete implementation of sliding-mode controllers (SMC) with barrier-function-based adaptations are analyzed, revealing fundamental limitations in conventional design frameworks. It is shown that under uniform sampling, the original continuous-time problem motivating these controllers becomes theoretically unsolvable under standard assumptions. To address this incompatibility, a revised control framework is proposed, explicitly incorporating actuator capacity constraints and sampled-data dynamics. Within this structure, the behavior of barrier function-based adaptive controllers (BFASMC) is rigorously examined, explaining their empirical success in digital implementations. A key theoretical result establishes an explicit relation between the actuator capacity, the sampling rate, and the width of the barrier function, providing a principled means to tune these controllers for different application requirements. This relation enables the resolution of various design problems with direct practical implications. A modified BFASMC is then introduced, systematically leveraging sampling effects to ensure finite-time convergence to a positively invariant predefined set, a key advancement for guaranteeing predictable safety margins.

Title: Lung-DDPM: Semantic Layout-guided Diffusion Models for Thoracic CT Image Synthesis
Authors: Yifan Jiang, Yannick Lemaréchal, Josée Bafaro, Jessica Abi-Rjeile, Philippe Joubert, Philippe Després, Venkata Manem
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a dice coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8\% and 18.6\% improvements in DICE and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.

Title: Applications of wavelet transform in classification of local field potential recorded from the rat brain in conditioned place preference paradigm
Authors: AmirAli Kalbasi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli, Shole Jamali, Abbas Haghparast
Abstract: This study investigates the multi-label classification of Local Field Potential (LFP) data from the hippocampus (HIP) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the rat brain, focusing on reward responses using the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm. Rats were conditioned with saline, morphine, and food rewards, and LFP recordings were conducted from both HIP and NAc during pre- and post-tests. The LFP data were classified into four categories: treatment types, test phases, recording channels, and chamber positions within the CPP setup. Features were extracted using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Wavelet Coherence, and Wavelet Scattering. Classification was performed via Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Support Vector Machines. Notably, in the Food group, HIP and combined HIP-NAc features yielded the highest classification accuracy for CPP chambers, whereas NAc features excelled in the Morphine group. Employing wavelet scattering, an 80% classification accuracy was achieved across treatment groups, test phases, and channels. Exceptionally high classification accuracies were observed for Food-post-test-HIP (99.75%) and Morphine-post-test-NAc (99.58%). The study reveals that NAc activity is pivotal for morphine-induced CPP, whereas HIP and HIP-NAc connectivity are crucial for food-induced CPP. The proposed methodology provides a novel avenue for precisely classifying LFP data, shedding light on neural circuit activities underlying behavioral responses.

Title: Holographic Joint Communications and Sensing With Cramer-Rao Bounds
Authors: Chandan Kumar Sheemar, Wali Ullah Khan, George Alexandropoulos, Jorge Querol, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) technology facilitates the seamless integration of communication and sensing functionalities within a unified framework, enhancing spectral efficiency, reducing hardware complexity, and enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental perception. This paper explores the potential of holographic JCAS systems by leveraging reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) to achieve high-resolution hybrid holographic beamforming while simultaneously sensing the environment. As the holographic transceivers are governed by arbitrary antenna spacing, we first derive exact Cramér-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for azimuth and elevation angles to rigorously characterize the three-dimensional (3D) sensing accuracy. To optimize the system performance, we propose a novel weighted multi-objective problem formulation that aims to simultaneously maximize the communication rate and minimize the CRBs. However, this formulation is highly non-convex due to the inverse dependence of the CRB on the optimization variables, making the solution extremely challenging. To address this, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on the Majorization-Maximization (MM) principle, employing alternating optimization to efficiently solve the problem. The proposed method relies on the closed-form surrogate functions that majorize the original objective derived herein, enabling tractable optimization. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under diverse system configurations, demonstrating its potential for next-generation holographic JCAS systems.

Title: On Performance of LoRa Fluid Antenna Systems
Authors: Gaoze Mu, Yanzhao Hou, Kai-Kit Wong, Mingjie Chen, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao, Ping Zhang
Abstract: This paper advocates a fluid antenna system (FAS) assisting long-range communication (LoRa-FAS) for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Our focus is on pilot sequence overhead and placement for FAS. Specifically, we consider embedding pilot sequences within symbols to reduce the equivalent symbol error rate (SER), leveraging the fact that the pilot sequences do not convey source information and correlation detection at the LoRa receiver needs not be performed across the entire symbol. We obtain closed-form approximations for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FAS channel, assuming perfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, the approximate SER, hence the bit error rate (BER), of the proposed LoRa-FAS is derived. Simulation results indicate that substantial SER gains can be achieved by FAS within the LoRa framework, even with a limited size of FAS. Furthermore, our analytical results align well with that of the Clarke's exact spatial correlation model. Finally, the correlation factor for the block correlation model should be selected as the proportion of the exact correlation matrix's eigenvalues greater than $1$.

Title: Ultrasound Phase Aberrated Point Spread Function Estimation with Convolutional Neural Network: Simulation Study
Authors: Wei-Hsiang Shen, Yu-An Lin, Meng-Lin Li
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging systems rely on accurate point spread function (PSF) estimation to support advanced image quality enhancement techniques such as deconvolution and speckle reduction. Phase aberration, caused by sound speed inhomogeneity within biological tissue, is inevitable in ultrasound imaging. It distorts the PSF by increasing sidelobe level and introducing asymmetric amplitude, making PSF estimation under phase aberration highly challenging. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework for estimating phase-aberrated PSFs using U-Net and complex U-Net architectures, operating on RF and complex k-space data, respectively, with the latter demonstrating superior performance. Synthetic phase aberration data, generated using the near-field phase screen model, is employed to train the networks. We evaluate various loss functions and find that log-compressed B-mode perceptual loss achieves the best performance, accurately predicting both the mainlobe and near sidelobe regions of the PSF. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating PSFs under varying levels of phase aberration.

Title: Leader-Follower Formation Tracking Control of Quadrotor UAVs Using Bearing Measurements
Authors: S. Doodeman, Z. Tang, M. Jacinto, R. Cunha, C. Silvestre
Abstract: This work addresses the practical problem of distributed formation tracking control of a group of quadrotor vehicles in a relaxed sensing graph topology with a very limited sensor set, where only one leader vehicle can access the global position. Other vehicles in the formation are assumed to only have access to inter-agent bearing (direction) measurements and relative velocities with respect to their neighbor agents. A hierarchical control architecture is adopted for each quadrotor, combining a high-gain attitude inner-loop and an outer-loop bearing-based formation controller with collision avoidance augmentation. The proposed method enables a group of quadrotors to track arbitrary bearing persistently exciting desired formations, including time-varying shapes and rotational maneuvers, such that each quadrotor only requires relative measurements to at least one neighboring quadrotor. The effective performance of the control strategy is validated by numerical simulations in MATLAB and real-world experiments with three quadrotors.

Title: Anatomy-Informed Deep Learning and Radiomics for Automated Neurofibroma Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI
Authors: Georgii Kolokolnikov, Marie-Lena Schmalhofer, Lennart Well, Said Farschtschi, Victor-Felix Mautner, Inka Ristow, Rene Werner
Abstract: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of neurofibromas (NFs), which exhibit significant variability in size, morphology, and anatomical location. Accurate and automated segmentation of these tumors in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is crucial to assess tumor burden and monitor disease progression. In this study, we present and analyze a fully automated pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed T2-weighted WB-MRI, consisting of three stages: anatomy segmentation, NF segmentation, and tumor candidate classification. In the first stage, we use the MRSegmentator model to generate an anatomy segmentation mask, extended with a high-risk zone for NFs. This mask is concatenated with the input image as anatomical context information for NF segmentation. The second stage employs an ensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets to produce an NF segmentation confidence mask. In the final stage, tumor candidates are extracted from the confidence mask and classified based on radiomic features, distinguishing tumors from non-tumor regions and reducing false positives. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three test sets representing different conditions: in-domain data (test set 1), varying imaging protocols and field strength (test set 2), and low tumor burden cases (test set 3). Experimental results show a 68% improvement in per-scan Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), a 21% increase in per-tumor DSC, and a two-fold improvement in F1 score for tumor detection in high tumor burden cases by integrating anatomy information. The method is integrated into the 3D Slicer platform for practical clinical use, with the code publicly accessible.

Title: Audio signal interpolation using optimal transportation of spectrograms
Authors: David Valdivia, Marien Renaud, Elsa Cazelles, Cédric Févotte
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating an artificial audio signal that interpolates between given source and target sounds. Our approach relies on the computation of Wasserstein barycenters of the source and target spectrograms, followed by phase reconstruction and inversion. In contrast with previous works, our new method considers the spectrograms globally and does not operate on a temporal frame-to-frame basis. An other contribution is to endow the transportation cost matrix with a specific structure that prohibits remote displacements of energy along the time axis, and for which optimal transport is made possible by leveraging the unbalanced transport framework. The proposed cost matrix makes sense from the audio perspective and also allows to reduce the computation load. Results with synthetic musical notes and real environmental sounds illustrate the potential of our novel approach.

Title: Handling systematic node biases in TDoA positioning systems
Authors: Miquel Garcia-Fernandez
Abstract: Node-specific hardware biases represent significant error source in wireless Time of Arrival (ToA) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) positioning. While bias estimation and treatment are well-established in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), their application in wireless Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a methodology, based on GNSS data processing, to mitigate these systematic biases. Specifically, the concept of Differential Transmitter Bias (DTB) is introduced to account for node-specific hardware variations. These DTB are in fact analogous to the Differential Code Bias (DCB) used in GNSS. This paper includes an analysis based on real data from a network of wireless nodes employed in an indoor navigation context and shows that the DTB exhibits remarkable stability, allowing it to be treated as a constant during an entire positioning session, with small variations as low as 2m, which is in the same uncertainty level as the noise of the measurements used by a TDoA-based positioning engine. In an operating positioning service context, these DTB would be transmitted to the user, similarly to GNSS, where satellite clock corrections are provided through navigation messages. This would allow the user to callibrate the TDoA measurements in order to obtain positioning with errors on the meter level.

Title: Learning-based Model Predictive Control for Passenger-Oriented Train Rescheduling with Flexible Train Composition
Authors: Xiaoyu Liu, Caio Fabio Oliveira da Silva, Azita Dabiri, Yihui Wang, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: This paper focuses on passenger-oriented real-time train rescheduling, considering flexible train composition and rolling stock circulation, by integrating learning-based and optimization-based approaches. A learning-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed for real-time train rescheduling with flexible train composition and rolling stock circulation to address time-varying passenger demands. In the proposed approach, first, the values of the integer variables are obtained by pre-trained long short-term memory (LSTM) networks; next, they are fixed and the values of continuous variables are determined via nonlinear constrained optimization. The learning-based MPC approach enables us to jointly consider efficiency and constraint satisfaction by combining learning-based and optimization-based approaches. In order to reduce the number of integer variables, four presolve techniques are developed to prune a subset of integer decision variables. Numerical simulations based on real-life data from the Beijing urban rail transit system are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed learning-based MPC approach.

Title: Context-Aware Doubly-Robust Semi-Supervised Learning
Authors: Clement Ruah, Houssem Sifaou, Osvaldo Simeone, Bashir Al-Hashimi
Abstract: The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in next-generation communication systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of traffic and network conditions, which call for the use of highly contextual, site-specific, data. A promising solution is to rely not only on real-world data, but also on synthetic pseudo-data generated by a network digital twin (NDT). However, the effectiveness of this approach hinges on the accuracy of the NDT, which can vary widely across different contexts. To address this problem, this paper introduces context-aware doubly-robust (CDR) learning, a novel semi-supervised scheme that adapts its reliance on the pseudo-data to the different levels of fidelity of the NDT across contexts. CDR is evaluated on the task of downlink beamforming, showing superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

Title: Causal Modeling of fMRI Time-series for Interpretable Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification
Authors: Peiyu Duan, Nicha C. Dvornek, Jiyao Wang, Lawrence H. Staib, James S. Duncan
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects social and communicative behaviors. It emerges in early life and is generally associated with lifelong disabilities. Thus, accurate and early diagnosis could facilitate treatment outcomes for those with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a useful tool that measures changes in brain signaling to facilitate our understanding of ASD. Much effort is being made to identify ASD biomarkers using various connectome-based machine learning and deep learning classifiers. However, correlation-based models cannot capture the non-linear interactions between brain regions. To solve this problem, we introduce a causality-inspired deep learning model that uses time-series information from fMRI and captures causality among ROIs useful for ASD classification. The model is compared with other baseline and state-of-the-art models with 5-fold cross-validation on the ABIDE dataset. We filtered the dataset by choosing all the images with mean FD less than 15mm to ensure data quality. Our proposed model achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 71.9% and an average AUC of 75.8%. Moreover, the inter-ROI causality interpretation of the model suggests that the left precuneus, right precuneus, and cerebellum are placed in the top 10 ROIs in inter-ROI causality among the ASD population. In contrast, these ROIs are not ranked in the top 10 in the control population. We have validated our findings with the literature and found that abnormalities in these ROIs are often associated with ASD.

Title: A Deep Neural Network-based Frequency Predictor for Frequency-Constrained Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Abstract: Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.

Title: Probabilistic Formulations for System Identification of Linear Dynamics with Bilinear Observation Models
Authors: Diyou Liu, Mohammad Khosravi
Abstract: In this paper, we address the identification problem for the systems characterized by linear time-invariant dynamics with bilinear observation models. More precisely, we consider a suitable parametric description of the system and formulate the identification problem as the estimation of the parameters defining the mathematical model of the system using the observed input-output data. To this end, we propose two probabilistic frameworks. The first framework employs the Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach, which accurately finds the optimal parameter estimates by maximizing a likelihood function. Subsequently, we develop a tractable first-order method to solve the optimization problem corresponding to the proposed ML approach. Additionally, to further improve tractability and computational efficiency of the estimation of the parameters, we introduce an alternative framework based on the Expectation--Maximization (EM) approach, which estimates the parameters using an appropriately designed cost function. We show that the EM cost function is invex, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form solution for the optimal parameters and also prove the recursive feasibility of the EM procedure. Through extensive numerical experiments, the practical implementation of the proposed approaches is demonstrated, and their estimation efficacy is verified and compared, highlighting the effectiveness of the methods to accurately estimate the system parameters and their potential for real-world applications in scenarios involving bilinear observation structures.

Title: NOTA: Multimodal Music Notation Understanding for Visual Large Language Model
Authors: Mingni Tang, Jiajia Li, Lu Yang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jinghao Tian, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Ping Wang
Abstract: Symbolic music is represented in two distinct forms: two-dimensional, visually intuitive score images, and one-dimensional, standardized text annotation sequences. While large language models have shown extraordinary potential in music, current research has primarily focused on unimodal symbol sequence text. Existing general-domain visual language models still lack the ability of music notation understanding. Recognizing this gap, we propose NOTA, the first large-scale comprehensive multimodal music notation dataset. It consists of 1,019,237 records, from 3 regions of the world, and contains 3 tasks. Based on the dataset, we trained NotaGPT, a music notation visual large language model. Specifically, we involve a pre-alignment training phase for cross-modal alignment between the musical notes depicted in music score images and their textual representation in ABC notation. Subsequent training phases focus on foundational music information extraction, followed by training on music notation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our NotaGPT-7B achieves significant improvement on music understanding, showcasing the effectiveness of NOTA and the training pipeline. Our datasets are open-sourced at this https URL.

Title: High-Dynamic Radar Sequence Prediction for Weather Nowcasting Using Spatiotemporal Coherent Gaussian Representation
Authors: Ziye Wang, Yiran Qin, Lin Zeng, Ruimao Zhang
Abstract: Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning. Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.

Title: Design of a Visual Pose Estimation Algorithm for Moon Landing
Authors: Atakan Süslü, Betül Rana Kuran, Halil Ersin Söken
Abstract: In order to make a pinpoint landing on the Moon, the spacecraft's navigation system must be accurate. To achieve the desired accuracy, navigational drift caused by the inertial sensors must be corrected. One way to correct this drift is to use absolute navigation solutions. In this study, a terrain absolute navigation method to estimate the spacecraft's position and attitude is proposed. This algorithm uses the position of the craters below the spacecraft for estimation. Craters seen by the camera onboard the spacecraft are detected and identified using a crater database known beforehand. In order to focus on estimation algorithms, image processing and crater matching steps are skipped. The accuracy of the algorithm and the effect of the crater number used for estimation are inspected by performing simulations.

Title: Safe Beyond the Horizon: Efficient Sampling-based MPC with Neural Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Ji Yin, Oswin So, Eric Yang Yu, Chuchu Fan, Panagiotis Tsiotras
Abstract: A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety specifications beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ''black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments.

Title: Inferring System and Optimal Control Parameters of Closed-Loop Systems from Partial Observations
Authors: Victor Geadah, Juncal Arbelaiz, Harrison Ritz, Nathaniel D. Daw, Jonathan D. Cohen, Jonathan W. Pillow
Abstract: We consider the joint problem of system identification and inverse optimal control for discrete-time stochastic Linear Quadratic Regulators. We analyze finite and infinite time horizons in a partially observed setting, where the state is observed noisily. To recover closed-loop system parameters, we develop inference methods based on probabilistic state-space model (SSM) techniques. First, we show that the system parameters exhibit non-identifiability in the infinite-horizon from closed-loop measurements, and we provide exact and numerical methods to disentangle the parameters. Second, to improve parameter identifiability, we show that we can further enhance recovery by either (1) incorporating additional partial measurements of the control signals or (2) moving to the finite-horizon setting. We further illustrate the performance of our methodology through numerical examples.

Title: DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Kanghyun Ryu, Kartik Nagpal, Qiayuan Liao, Koushil Sreenath, Negar Mehr
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.

Title: Pseudoinverse Diffusion Models for Generative CT Image Reconstruction from Low Dose Data
Authors: Matthew Tivnan, Dufan Wu, Quanzheng Li
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced generative deep learning for image processing. Measurement conditioned models have also been applied to inverse problems such as CT reconstruction. However, the conventional approach, culminating in white noise, often requires a high number of reverse process update steps and score function evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative forward process in score-based diffusion models that aligns with the noise characteristics of low-dose CT reconstructions, rather than converging to white noise. This method significantly reduces the number of required score function evaluations, enhancing efficiency and maintaining familiar noise textures for radiologists, Our approach not only accelerates the generative process but also retains CT noise correlations, a key aspect often criticized by clinicians for deep learning reconstructions. In this work, we rigorously define a matrix-controlled stochastic process for this purpose and validate it through computational experiments. Using a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC), we simulate low-dose CT measurements and train our model, comparing it with a baseline scalar diffusion process and conditional diffusion model. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our pseudoinverse diffusion model in terms of efficiency and the ability to produce high-quality reconstructions that are familiar in texture to medical professionals in a low number of score function evaluations. This advancement paves the way for more efficient and clinically practical diffusion models in medical imaging, particularly beneficial in scenarios demanding rapid reconstructions or lower radiation exposure.

Title: Improving Streaming Speech Recognition With Time-Shifted Contextual Attention And Dynamic Right Context Masking
Authors: Khanh Le, Duc Chau
Abstract: Chunk-based inference stands out as a popular approach in developing real-time streaming speech recognition, valued for its simplicity and efficiency. However, because it restricts the model's focus to only the history and current chunk context, it may result in performance degradation in scenarios that demand consideration of future context. Addressing this, we propose a novel approach featuring Time-Shifted Contextual Attention (TSCA) and Dynamic Right Context (DRC) masking. Our method shows a relative word error rate reduction of 10 to 13.9% on the Librispeech dataset with the inclusion of in-context future information provided by TSCA. Moreover, we present a streaming automatic speech recognition pipeline that facilitates the integration of TSCA with minimal user-perceived latency, while also enabling batch processing capability, making it practical for various applications.

Title: Graph-Based Deep Learning on Stereo EEG for Predicting Seizure Freedom in Epilepsy Patients
Authors: Artur Agaronyan, Syeda Abeera Amir, Nunthasiri Wittayanakorn, John Schreiber, Marius G. Linguraru, William Gaillard, Chima Oluigbo, Syed Muhammad Anwar
Abstract: Predicting seizure freedom is essential for tailoring epilepsy treatment. But accurate prediction remains challenging with traditional methods, especially with diverse patient populations. This study developed a deep learning-based graph neural network (GNN) model to predict seizure freedom from stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) data in patients with refractory epilepsy. We utilized high-quality sEEG data from 15 pediatric patients to train a deep learning model that can accurately predict seizure freedom outcomes and advance understanding of brain connectivity at the seizure onset zone. Our model integrates local and global connectivity using graph convolutions with multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture connections between difficult-to-study regions such as the thalamus and motor regions. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.4% in binary class analysis, 86.6% in patient-wise analysis, and 81.4% in multi-class analysis. Node and edge-level feature analysis highlighted the anterior cingulate and frontal pole regions as key contributors to seizure freedom outcomes. The nodes identified by our model were also more likely to coincide with seizure onset zones. Our findings underscore the potential of new connectivity-based deep learning models such as GNNs for enhancing the prediction of seizure freedom, predicting seizure onset zones, connectivity analysis of the brain during seizure, as well as informing AI-assisted personalized epilepsy treatment planning.

Title: Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandits with Minimum Reward Guarantee Fairness
Authors: Piyushi Manupriya, Himanshu, SakethaNath Jagarlapudi, Ganesh Ghalme
Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem, a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible expected reward. Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the optimal fair policy and that of the given policy. We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between fairness and social welfare regrets.

Title: Retrieval-Augmented Speech Recognition Approach for Domain Challenges
Authors: Peng Shen, Xugang Lu, Hisashi Kawai
Abstract: Speech recognition systems often face challenges due to domain mismatch, particularly in real-world applications where domain-specific data is unavailable because of data accessibility and confidentiality constraints. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for large language models (LLMs), this paper introduces a LLM-based retrieval-augmented speech recognition method that incorporates domain-specific textual data at the inference stage to enhance recognition performance. Rather than relying on domain-specific textual data during the training phase, our model is trained to learn how to utilize textual information provided in prompts for LLM decoder to improve speech recognition performance. Benefiting from the advantages of the RAG retrieval mechanism, our approach efficiently accesses locally available domain-specific documents, ensuring a convenient and effective process for solving domain mismatch problems. Experiments conducted on the CSJ database demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves speech recognition accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CSJ dataset, even without relying on the full training data.

Title: Omnidirectional Image Quality Captioning: A Large-scale Database and A New Model
Authors: Jiebin Yan, Ziwen Tan, Yuming Fang, Junjie Chen, Wenhui Jiang, Zhou Wang
Abstract: The fast growing application of omnidirectional images calls for effective approaches for omnidirectional image quality assessment (OIQA). Existing OIQA methods have been developed and tested on homogeneously distorted omnidirectional images, but it is hard to transfer their success directly to the heterogeneously distorted omnidirectional images. In this paper, we conduct the largest study so far on OIQA, where we establish a large-scale database called OIQ-10K containing 10,000 omnidirectional images with both homogeneous and heterogeneous distortions. A comprehensive psychophysical study is elaborated to collect human opinions for each omnidirectional image, together with the spatial distributions (within local regions or globally) of distortions, and the head and eye movements of the subjects. Furthermore, we propose a novel multitask-derived adaptive feature-tailoring OIQA model named IQCaption360, which is capable of generating a quality caption for an omnidirectional image in a manner of textual template. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IQCaption360, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on the proposed OIQ-10K database. The OIQ-10K database and the related source codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Categorical Lyapunov Theory I: Stability of Flows
Authors: Aaron D. Ames, Joe Moeller, Paulo Tabuada
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.

Title: Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs
Authors: Le Zhang, Quanling Zhao, Run Wang, Shirley Bian, Onat Gungor, Flavio Ponzina, Tajana Rosing
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Title: Advancing User-Voice Interaction: Exploring Emotion-Aware Voice Assistants Through a Role-Swapping Approach
Authors: Yong Ma, Yuchong Zhang, Di Fu, Stephanie Zubicueta Portales, Danica Kragic, Morten Fjeld
Abstract: As voice assistants (VAs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, the need for emotion-aware systems that can recognize and respond appropriately to user emotions has grown. While significant progress has been made in speech emotion recognition (SER) and sentiment analysis, effectively addressing user emotions-particularly negative ones-remains a challenge. This study explores human emotional response strategies in VA interactions using a role-swapping approach, where participants regulate AI emotions rather than receiving pre-programmed responses. Through speech feature analysis and natural language processing (NLP), we examined acoustic and linguistic patterns across various emotional scenarios. Results show that participants favor neutral or positive emotional responses when engaging with negative emotional cues, highlighting a natural tendency toward emotional regulation and de-escalation. Key acoustic indicators such as root mean square (RMS), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and jitter were identified as sensitive to emotional states, while sentiment polarity and lexical diversity (TTR) distinguished between positive and negative responses. These findings provide valuable insights for developing adaptive, context-aware VAs capable of delivering empathetic, culturally sensitive, and user-aligned responses. By understanding how humans naturally regulate emotions in AI interactions, this research contributes to the design of more intuitive and emotionally intelligent voice assistants, enhancing user trust and engagement in human-AI interactions.

Title: TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Giuseppe Paolo, Abdelhakim Benechehab, Hamza Cherkaoui, Albert Thomas, Balázs Kégl
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent this http URL enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.

Title: Aligning Task- and Reconstruction-Oriented Communications for Edge Intelligence
Authors: Yufeng Diao, Yichi Zhang, Changyang She, Philip Guodong Zhao, Emma Liying Li
Abstract: Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the receiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.

Title: FaultGPT: Industrial Fault Diagnosis Question Answering System by Vision Language Models
Authors: Jiao Chen, Ruyi Huang, Zuohong Lv, Jianhua Tang, Weihua Li
Abstract: Recently, employing single-modality large language models based on mechanical vibration signals as Tuning Predictors has introduced new perspectives in intelligent fault diagnosis. However, the potential of these methods to leverage multimodal data remains underexploited, particularly in complex mechanical systems where relying on a single data source often fails to capture comprehensive fault information. In this paper, we present FaultGPT, a novel model that generates fault diagnosis reports directly from raw vibration signals. By leveraging large vision-language models (LVLM) and text-based supervision, FaultGPT performs end-to-end fault diagnosis question answering (FDQA), distinguishing itself from traditional classification or regression approaches. Specifically, we construct a large-scale FDQA instruction dataset for instruction tuning of LVLM. This dataset includes vibration time-frequency image-text label pairs and human instruction-ground truth pairs. To enhance the capability in generating high-quality fault diagnosis reports, we design a multi-scale cross-modal image decoder to extract fine-grained fault semantics and conducted instruction tuning without introducing additional training parameters into the LVLM. Extensive experiments, including fault diagnosis report generation, few-shot and zero-shot evaluation across multiple datasets, validate the superior performance and adaptability of FaultGPT in diverse industrial scenarios.

Title: Network Resource Optimization for ML-Based UAV Condition Monitoring with Vibration Analysis
Authors: Alexandre Gemayel, Dimitrios Michael Manias, Abdallah Shami
Abstract: As smart cities begin to materialize, the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their reliability becomes increasingly important. One aspect of reliability relates to Condition Monitoring (CM), where Machine Learning (ML) models are leveraged to identify abnormal and adverse conditions. Given the resource-constrained nature of next-generation edge networks, the utilization of precious network resources must be minimized. This work explores the optimization of network resources for ML-based UAV CM frameworks. The developed framework uses experimental data and varies the feature extraction aggregation interval to optimize ML model selection. Additionally, by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques, there is a 99.9% reduction in network resource consumption.

Title: Estimating Vehicle Speed on Roadways Using RNNs and Transformers: A Video-based Approach
Authors: Sai Krishna Reddy Mareddy, Dhanush Upplapati, Dhanush Kumar Antharam
Abstract: This project explores the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Transformers, to the task of vehicle speed estimation using video data. Traditional methods of speed estimation, such as radar and manual systems, are often constrained by high costs, limited coverage, and potential disruptions. In contrast, leveraging existing surveillance infrastructure and cutting-edge neural network architectures presents a non-intrusive, scalable solution. Our approach utilizes LSTM and GRU to effectively manage long-term dependencies within the temporal sequence of video frames, while Transformers are employed to harness their self-attention mechanisms, enabling the processing of entire sequences in parallel and focusing on the most informative segments of the data. This study demonstrates that both LSTM and GRU outperform basic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) due to their advanced gating mechanisms. Furthermore, increasing the sequence length of input data consistently improves model accuracy, highlighting the importance of contextual information in dynamic environments. Transformers, in particular, show exceptional adaptability and robustness across varied sequence lengths and complexities, making them highly suitable for real-time applications in diverse traffic conditions. The findings suggest that integrating these sophisticated neural network models can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated speed detection systems, thus promising to revolutionize traffic management and road safety.

Title: Autonomous helicopter aerial refueling: controller design and performance guarantees
Authors: Damsara Jayarathne, Santiago Paternain, Sandipan Mishra
Abstract: In this paper, we present a control design methodology, stability criteria, and performance bounds for autonomous helicopter aerial refueling. Autonomous aerial refueling is particularly difficult due to the aerodynamic interaction between the wake of the tanker, the contact-sensitive nature of the maneuver, and the uncertainty in drogue motion. Since the probe tip is located significantly away from the helicopter's center-of-gravity, its position (and velocity) is strongly sensitive to the helicopter's attitude (and angular rates). In addition, the fact that the helicopter is operating at high speeds to match the velocity of the tanker forces it to maintain a particular orientation, making the docking maneuver especially challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel outer-loop position controller that incorporates the probe position and velocity into the feedback loop. The position and velocity of the probe tip depend both on the position (velocity) and on the attitude (angular rates) of the aircraft. We derive analytical guarantees for docking performance in terms of the uncertainty of the drogue motion and the angular acceleration of the helicopter, using the ultimate boundedness property of the closed-loop error dynamics. Simulations are performed on a high-fidelity UH60 helicopter model with a high-fidelity drogue motion under wind effects to validate the proposed approach for realistic refueling scenarios. These high-fidelity simulations reveal that the proposed control methodology yields an improvement of 36% in the 2-norm docking error compared to the existing standard controller.

Title: Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Optimizing Wireless Communications -- Theory and Experimental Validation
Authors: Hugo Prod'homme, Jean Tapie, Luc Le Magoarou, Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.

Abstract: Although being widely adopted for evaluating generated audio signals, the Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) suffers from significant limitations, including reliance on Gaussian assumptions, sensitivity to sample size, and high computational complexity. As an alternative, we introduce the Kernel Audio Distance (KAD), a novel, distribution-free, unbiased, and computationally efficient metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Through analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate KAD's advantages: (1) faster convergence with smaller sample sizes, enabling reliable evaluation with limited data; (2) lower computational cost, with scalable GPU acceleration; and (3) stronger alignment with human perceptual judgments. By leveraging advanced embeddings and characteristic kernels, KAD captures nuanced differences between real and generated audio. Open-sourced in the kadtk toolkit, KAD provides an efficient, reliable, and perceptually aligned benchmark for evaluating generative audio models.

Title: Benchmarking machine learning for bowel sound pattern classification from tabular features to pretrained models
Authors: Zahra Mansour, Verena Uslar, Dirk Weyhe, Danilo Hollosi, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: The development of electronic stethoscopes and wearable recording sensors opened the door to the automated analysis of bowel sound (BS) signals. This enables a data-driven analysis of bowel sound patterns, their interrelations, and their correlation to different pathologies. This work leverages a BS dataset collected from 16 healthy subjects that was annotated according to four established BS patterns. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models to detect and/or classify BS patterns. The selection of considered models covers models using tabular features, convolutional neural networks based on spectrograms and models pre-trained on large audio datasets. The results highlight the clear superiority of pre-trained models, particularly in detecting classes with few samples, achieving an AUC of 0.89 in distinguishing BS from non-BS using a HuBERT model and an AUC of 0.89 in differentiating bowel sound patterns using a Wav2Vec 2.0 model. These results pave the way for an improved understanding of bowel sounds in general and future machine-learning-driven diagnostic applications for gastrointestinal examinations

Title: Continual Person Identification using Footstep-Induced Floor Vibrations on Heterogeneous Floor Structures
Authors: Yiwen Dong, Hae Young Noh
Abstract: Person identification is important for smart buildings to provide personalized services such as health monitoring, activity tracking, and personnel management. However, previous person identification relies on pre-collected data from everyone, which is impractical in many buildings and public facilities in which visitors are typically expected. This calls for a continual person identification system that gradually learns people's identities on the fly. Existing studies use cameras to achieve this goal, but they require direct line-of-sight and also have raised privacy concerns in public. Other modalities such as wearables and pressure mats are limited by the requirement of device-carrying or dense deployment. Thus, prior studies introduced footstep-induced structural vibration sensing, which is non-intrusive and perceived as more privacy-friendly. However, this approach has a significant challenge: the high variability of vibration data due to structural heterogeneity and human gait variations, which makes online person identification algorithms perform poorly. In this paper, we characterize the variability in footstep-induced structural vibration data for accurate online person identification. To achieve this, we quantify and decompose different sources of variability and then design a feature transformation function to reduce the variability within each person's data to make different people's data more separable. We evaluate our approach through field experiments with 20 people. The results show a 70% variability reduction and a 90% accuracy for online person identification.

Title: Time-Domain Classification of the Brain Reward System: Analysis of Natural and Drug Reward Driven Local Field Potential Signals in Hippocampus and Nucleus Accumbens
Authors: AmirAli Kalbasi, Shole Jamali, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli, Alireza Behzadnia, Abbas Haghparast
Abstract: Addiction is a major public health concern characterized by compulsive reward-seeking behavior. The excitatory glutamatergic signals from the hippocampus (HIP) to the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate learned behavior in addiction. Limited comparative studies have investigated the neural pathways activated by natural and unnatural reward sources. This study has evaluated neural activities in HIP and NAc associated with food (natural) and morphine (drug) reward sources using local field potential (LFP). We developed novel approaches to classify LFP signals into the source of reward and recorded regions by considering the time-domain feature of these signals. Proposed methods included a validation step of the LFP signals using autocorrelation, Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent to assess the meaningful stability of these signals (lack of chaos). By utilizing the probability density function (PDF) of LFP signals and applying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), data were classified to the source of the reward. Also, HIP and NAc regions were visually separated and classified using the symmetrized dot pattern technique, which can be applied in real-time to ensure the deep brain region of interest is being targeted accurately during LFP recording. We believe our method provides a computationally light and fast, real-time signal analysis approach with real-world implementation.

Title: Sandwiched Compression: Repurposing Standard Codecs with Neural Network Wrappers
Authors: Onur G. Guleryuz, Philip A. Chou, Berivan Isik, Hugues Hoppe, Danhang Tang, Ruofei Du, Jonathan Taylor, Philip Davidson, Sean Fanello
Abstract: We propose sandwiching standard image and video codecs between pre- and post-processing neural networks. The networks are jointly trained through a differentiable codec proxy to minimize a given rate-distortion loss. This sandwich architecture not only improves the standard codec's performance on its intended content, but more importantly, adapts the codec to other types of image/video content and to other distortion measures. The sandwich learns to transmit ``neural code images'' that optimize and improve overall rate-distortion performance, with the improvements becoming significant especially when the overall problem is well outside of the scope of the codec's design. We apply the sandwich architecture to standard codecs with mismatched sources transporting different numbers of channels, higher resolution, higher dynamic range, computer graphics, and with perceptual distortion measures. The results demonstrate substantial improvements (up to 9 dB gains or up to 30\% bitrate reductions) compared to alternative adaptations. We establish optimality properties for sandwiched compression and design differentiable codec proxies approximating current standard codecs. We further analyze model complexity, visual quality under perceptual metrics, as well as sandwich configurations that offer interesting potentials in video compression and streaming.

Title: Online Planning of Power Flows for Power Systems Against Bushfires Using Spatial Context
Authors: Jianyu Xu, Qiuzhuang Sun, Yang Yang, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.

Title: Exploring Quasi-Global Solutions to Compound Lens Based Computational Imaging Systems
Authors: Yao Gao, Qi Jiang, Shaohua Gao, Lei Sun, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang
Abstract: Recently, joint design approaches that simultaneously optimize optical systems and downstream algorithms through data-driven learning have demonstrated superior performance over traditional separate design approaches. However, current joint design approaches heavily rely on the manual identification of initial lenses, posing challenges and limitations, particularly for compound lens systems with multiple potential starting points. In this work, we present Quasi-Global Search Optics (QGSO) to automatically design compound lens based computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution in all search results. Extensive experimental results illustrate that QGSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global search ability, which automatically provides compound lens based computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to existing paradigms. The source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers
Authors: Yan Chen, Tao Li
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.

Title: A Parameterized Nonlinear Magnetic Equivalent Circuit for Design and Fast Analysis of Radial Flux Magnetic Gears with Bridges
Authors: Danial Kazemikia, Matthew Gardner
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer significant advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require efficient and accurate modeling tools for optimization and commercialization. This paper presents the first fast and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG), capable of analyzing designs with bridges critical structural elements that introduce intense localized magnetic saturation. The proposed model systematically incorporates nonlinear effects while maintaining rapid simulation times through a parameterized geometry and adaptable flux tube distribution. A robust initialization strategy ensures reliable performance across diverse designs. Extensive validation against nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) confirms the model's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions. A comprehensive parametric study of 140,000 designs demonstrates close agreement with FEA results, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Unlike previous MEC approaches, this model provides a generalized, computationally efficient solution for analyzing a wide range of RFMG designs with or without bridges, making it particularly well-suited for large scale design optimization.

Title: Graphon Particle Systems, Part II: Dynamics of Distributed Stochastic Continuum Optimization
Authors: Yan Chen, Tao Li
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.

Authors: Julien Hauret, Malo Olivier, Thomas Joubaud, Christophe Langrenne, Sarah Poirée, Véronique Zimpfer, Éric Bavu
Abstract: Vibravox is a dataset compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) containing audio recordings using five different body-conduction audio sensors : two in-ear microphones, two bone conduction vibration pickups and a laryngophone. The dataset also includes audio data from an airborne microphone used as a reference. The Vibravox corpus contains 45 hours of speech samples and physiological sounds recorded by 188 participants under different acoustic conditions imposed by an high order ambisonics 3D spatializer. Annotations about the recording conditions and linguistic transcriptions are also included in the corpus. We conducted a series of experiments on various speech-related tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement and speaker verification. These experiments were carried out using state-of-the-art models to evaluate and compare their performances on signals captured by the different audio sensors offered by the Vibravox dataset, with the aim of gaining a better grasp of their individual characteristics.

Title: World of Forms: Deformable Geometric Templates for One-Shot Surface Meshing in Coronary CT Angiography

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation and surface mesh generation typically involve a sequential pipeline from image to segmentation to meshes, often requiring large training datasets while making limited use of prior geometric knowledge. This may lead to topological inconsistencies and suboptimal performance in low-data regimes. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient deep learning method for direct 3D anatomical object surface meshing using geometric priors. Our approach employs a multi-resolution graph neural network that operates on a prior geometric template which is deformed to fit object boundaries of interest. We show how different templates may be used for the different surface meshing targets, and introduce a novel masked autoencoder pretraining strategy for 3D spherical data. The proposed method outperforms nnUNet in a one-shot setting for segmentation of the pericardium, left ventricle (LV) cavity and the LV myocardium. Similarly, the method outperforms other lumen segmentation operating on multi-planar reformatted images. Results further indicate that mesh quality is on par with or improves upon marching cubes post-processing of voxel mask predictions, while remaining flexible in the choice of mesh triangulation prior, thus paving the way for more accurate and topologically consistent 3D medical object surface meshing.

Title: A Hierarchical DRL Approach for Resource Optimization in Multi-RIS Multi-Operator Networks
Authors: Haocheng Zhang, Wei Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiping Lu, Ming Li
Abstract: As reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) emerge as a pivotal technology in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, their deployment within practical multiple operator (OP) networks presents significant challenges, including the coordination of RIS configurations among OPs, interference management, and privacy maintenance. A promising strategy is to treat RIS as a public resource managed by an RIS provider (RP), which can enhance resource allocation efficiency by allowing dynamic access for multiple OPs. However, the intricate nature of coordinating management and optimizing RIS configurations significantly complicates the implementation process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach that decomposes the complicated RIS resource optimization problem into several subtasks. Specifically, a top-level RP-agent is responsible for RIS allocation, while low-level OP-agents control their assigned RISs and handle beamforming, RIS phase-shifts, and user association. By utilizing the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) theory, we establish a sophisticated interaction mechanism between the RP and OPs, and introduce an advanced hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an improved sequential-HPPO (S-HPPO) algorithm to address the curse of dimensionality encountered with a single RP-agent. Experimental results validate the stability of the HPPO algorithm across various environmental parameters, demonstrating its superiority over other benchmarks for joint resource optimization. Finally, we conduct a detailed comparative analysis between the proposed S-HPPO and HPPO algorithms, showcasing that the S-HPPO algorithm achieves faster convergence and improved performance in large-scale RIS allocation scenarios.

Title: A Risk-Averse Just-In-Time Scheme for Learning-Based Operation of Microgrids with Coupled Electricity-Hydrogen-Ammonia under Uncertainties
Authors: Longyan Li, Chao Ning, Guangsheng Pan, Leiqi Zhang, Wei Gu, Liang Zhao, Wenli Du, Mohammad Shahidehpour
Abstract: This paper proposes a Risk-Averse Just-In-Time (RAJIT) operation scheme for Ammonia-Hydrogen-based Micro-Grids (AHMGs) to boost electricity-hydrogen-ammonia coupling under uncertainties. First, an off-grid AHMG model is developed, featuring a novel multi-mode ammonia synthesis process and a hydrogen-ammonia dual gas turbine with tunable feed-in ratios. Subsequently, a state-behavior mapping strategy linking hydrogen storage levels with the operation modes of ammonia synthesis is established to prevent cost-ineffective shutdowns. The proposed model substantially improves operational flexibility but results in a challenging nonlinear fractional program. Based upon this model, a data-driven RAJIT scheme is developed for the real-time rolling optimization of AHMGs. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all schemes using one optimization method throughout, the data driven RAJIT intelligently switches between cost-effective deterministic optimization and risk-averse online-learning distributionally robust optimization depending on actual risk profiles, thus capitalizing on the respective strengths of these two optimization methods. To facilitate the solution of the resulting nonlinear program, we develop an equivalent-reformulation-based solution methodology by leveraging a constraint-tightening technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees safety and yields an overall cost reduction up to 14.6% compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

Title: R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge
Authors: Aladin Djuhera, Vlad C. Andrei, Mohsen Pourghasemian, Haris Gacanin, Holger Boche, Walid Saad
Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.

Title: Large Model Empowered Streaming Speech Semantic Communications
Authors: Zhenzi Weng, Zhijin Qin, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a large model-empowered streaming semantic communication system for speech transmission across various languages, named LSSC-ST. Specifically, we devise an edge-device collaborative semantic communication architecture by offloading the intricate semantic extraction and channel coding modules to edge servers, thereby reducing the computational burden on local devices. To support multilingual speech transmission, pre-trained large speech models are utilized to learn unified semantic features from speech in different languages, breaking the constraint of a single input language and enhancing the practicality of the LSSC-ST. Moreover, the input speech is sequentially streamed into the developed system as short speech segments, which enables low transmission latency without degrading the quality of the produced speech. A novel dynamic speech segmentation algorithm is proposed to further reduce the transmission latency by adaptively adjusting the duration of speech segments. According to simulation results, the LSSC-ST provides more accurate speech transmission and achieves a streaming manner with lower latency compared to the existing non-streaming semantic communication systems.

Title: Resiliency metrics quantifying emergency response in a distribution system
Authors: Shikhar Pandey, Gowtham Kandaperumal, Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson
Abstract: The electric distribution system is a cornerstone of modern life, playing a critical role in the daily activities and well-being of individuals. As the world transitions toward a decarbonized future, where even mobility relies on electricity, ensuring the resilience of the grid becomes paramount. This paper introduces novel resilience metrics designed to equip utilities and stakeholders with actionable tools to assess performance during storm events. The metrics focus on emergency storm response and the resources required to improve customer service. The practical calculation of the metrics from historical utility data is demonstrated for multiple storm events. Additionally, the metrics' improvement with added crews is estimated by "rerunning history" with faster restoration. By applying this resilience framework, utilities can enhance their restoration strategies and unlock potential cost savings, benefiting both providers and customers in an era of heightened energy dependency.

Title: Self-Supervised Diffusion MRI Denoising via Iterative and Stable Refinement
Authors: Chenxu Wu, Qingpeng Kong, Zihang Jiang, S. Kevin Zhou
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), serves as a ``microscope'' for anatomical structures and routinely mitigates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio scans by compromising temporal or spatial resolution. However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

Title: UltraBones100k: A reliable automated labeling method and large-scale dataset for ultrasound-based bone surface extraction
Authors: Luohong Wu, Nicola A. Cavalcanti, Matthias Seibold, Giuseppe Loggia, Lisa Reissner, Jonas Hein, Silvan Beeler, Arnd Viehöfer, Stephan Wirth, Lilian Calvet, Philipp Fürnstahl
Abstract: Ultrasound-based bone surface segmentation is crucial in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. However, ultrasound images have limitations, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, and acoustic shadowing, which make interpretation difficult. Existing deep learning models for bone segmentation rely primarily on costly manual labeling by experts, limiting dataset size and model generalizability. Additionally, the complexity of ultrasound physics and acoustic shadow makes the images difficult for humans to interpret, leading to incomplete labels in anechoic regions and limiting model performance. To advance ultrasound bone segmentation and establish effective model benchmarks, larger and higher-quality datasets are needed. We propose a methodology for collecting ex-vivo ultrasound datasets with automatically generated bone labels, including anechoic regions. The proposed labels are derived by accurately superimposing tracked bone CT models onto the tracked ultrasound images. These initial labels are refined to account for ultrasound physics. A clinical evaluation is conducted by an expert physician specialized on orthopedic sonography to assess the quality of the generated bone labels. A neural network for bone segmentation is trained on the collected dataset and its predictions are compared to expert manual labels, evaluating accuracy, completeness, and F1-score. We collected the largest known dataset of 100k ultrasound images of human lower limbs with bone labels, called UltraBones100k. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirmed that the bone alignment after our method significantly improved the quality of bone labeling (p < 0.001). The model trained on UltraBones100k consistently outperforms manual labeling in all metrics, particularly in low-intensity regions (320% improvement in completeness at a distance threshold of 0.5 mm).

Title: Towards Efficient and Multifaceted Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training Leveraging Hierarchical Selective State Space Model and Decoupled Cross-entropy Loss
Authors: Fu-An Chao, Berlin Chen
Abstract: Prior efforts in building computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems often treat automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as separate fronts: the former aims to provide multiple pronunciation aspect scores across diverse linguistic levels, while the latter focuses instead on pinpointing the precise phonetic pronunciation errors made by non-native language learners. However, it is generally expected that a full-fledged CAPT system should perform both functionalities simultaneously and efficiently. In response to this surging demand, we in this work first propose HMamba, a novel CAPT approach that seamlessly integrates APA and MDD tasks in parallel. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, decoupled cross-entropy loss (deXent), specifically tailored for MDD to facilitate better-supervised learning for detecting mispronounced phones, thereby enhancing overall performance. A comprehensive set of empirical results on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on APA. Notably, our proposed approach also yields a considerable improvement in MDD performance over a strong baseline, achieving an F1-score of 63.85%. Our codes are made available at this https URL

Title: Vision Foundation Models in Medical Image Analysis: Advances and Challenges
Authors: Pengchen Liang, Bin Pu, Haishan Huang, Yiwei Li, Hualiang Wang, Weibo Ma, Qing Chang
Abstract: The rapid development of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), particularly Vision Transformers (ViT) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked significant advances in the field of medical image analysis. These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.

Title: SCALES: Boost Binary Neural Network for Image Super-Resolution with Efficient Scalings
Authors: Renjie Wei, Zechun Liu, Yuchen Fan, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li
Abstract: Deep neural networks for image super-resolution (SR) have demonstrated superior performance. However, the large memory and computation consumption hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binary neural networks (BNNs), which quantize the floating point weights and activations to 1-bit can significantly reduce the cost. Although BNNs for image classification have made great progress these days, existing BNNs for SR still suffer from a large performance gap between the FP SR networks. To this end, we observe the activation distribution in SR networks and find much larger pixel-to-pixel, channel-to-channel, layer-to-layer, and image-to-image variation in the activation distribution than image classification networks. However, existing BNNs for SR fail to capture these variations that contain rich information for image reconstruction, leading to inferior performance. To address this problem, we propose SCALES, a binarization method for SR networks that consists of the layer-wise scaling factor, the spatial re-scaling method, and the channel-wise re-scaling method, capturing the layer-wise, pixel-wise, and channel-wise variations efficiently in an input-dependent manner. We evaluate our method across different network architectures and datasets. For CNN-based SR networks, our binarization method SCALES outperforms the prior art method by 0.2dB with fewer parameters and operations. With SCALES, we achieve the first accurate binary Transformer-based SR network, improving PSNR by more than 1dB compared to the baseline method.

Title: Quantum Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic and Semi-Definite Programs for Optimal Solutions
Authors: Naci Saldi, Sina Sanjari, Serdar Yuksel
Abstract: In this paper, building on the formulation of quantum Markov decision processes (q-MDPs) presented in our previous work [{\sc N.~Saldi, S.~Sanjari, and S.~Yüksel}, {\em Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies}, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 2024], our focus shifts to the development of semi-definite programming approaches for optimal policies and value functions of both open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.

Title: A Dual-Motor Actuator for Ceiling Robots with High Force and High Speed Capabilities
Authors: Ian Lalonde, Jeff Denis, Mathieu Lamy, Alexandre Girard
Abstract: Patient transfer devices allow to move patients passively in hospitals and care centers. Instead of hoisting the patient, it would be beneficial in some cases to assist their movement, enabling them to move by themselves. However, patient assistance requires devices capable of precisely controlling output forces at significantly higher speeds than those used for patient transfers alone, and a single motor solution would be over-sized and show poor efficiency to do both functions. This paper presents a dual-motor actuator and control schemes adapted for a patient mobility equipment that can be used to transfer patients, assist patient in their movement, and help prevent falls. The prototype is shown to be able to lift patients weighing up to 318 kg, to assist a patient with a desired force of up to 100 kg with a precision of 7.8%. Also, a smart control scheme to manage falls is shown to be able to stop a patient who is falling by applying a desired deceleration.

Title: AI and Entrepreneurship: Facial Recognition Technology Detects Entrepreneurs, Outperforming Human Experts
Authors: Martin Obschonka, Christian Fisch, Tharindu Fernando, Clinton Fookes
Abstract: Occupational outcomes like entrepreneurship are generally considered personal information that individuals should have the autonomy to disclose. With the advancing capability of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer private details from widely available human-centric data (e.g., social media), it is crucial to investigate whether AI can accurately extract private occupational information from such data. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks can classify individuals as entrepreneurs with high accuracy based on facial images sourced from Crunchbase, a premier source for entrepreneurship data. Utilizing a dataset comprising facial images of 40,728 individuals, including both entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a contrastive learning approach based on pairs of facial images (one entrepreneur and one non-entrepreneur per pair). While human experts (n=650) and trained participants (n=133) were unable to classify entrepreneurs with accuracy above chance levels (>50%), our AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 79.51%. Several robustness tests indicate that this high level of accuracy is maintained under various conditions. These results indicate privacy risks for entrepreneurs.

Abstract: India has 1369 languages of which 22 are official. About 13 different scripts are used to represent these languages. A Common Label Set (CLS) was developed based on phonetics to address the issue of large vocabulary of units required in the End-to-End (E2E) framework for multilingual synthesis. The Indian language text is first converted to CLS. This approach enables seamless code switching across 13 Indian languages and English in a given native speaker's voice, which corresponds to everyday speech in the Indian subcontinent, where the population is multilingual.

Title: DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents
Authors: Taiyi Wang, Zhihao Wu, Jianheng Liu, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Kun Shao
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.

Title: A Multi-modal Approach to Dysarthria Detection and Severity Assessment Using Speech and Text Information
Authors: M Anuprabha, Krishna Gurugubelli, V Kesavaraj, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Automatic detection and severity assessment of dysarthria are crucial for delivering targeted therapeutic interventions to patients. While most existing research focuses primarily on speech modality, this study introduces a novel approach that leverages both speech and text modalities. By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.

Title: Do Audio-Visual Segmentation Models Truly Segment Sounding Objects?
Authors: Jia Li, Wenjie Zhao, Ziru Huang, Yunhui Guo, Yapeng Tian
Abstract: Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) requires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to determine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging transformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have achieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important question remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to segment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this issue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in current methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly on visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in unreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this challenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark incorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient noise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach combining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided similarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS methods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the prevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable improvements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining near-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation performance.

Title: UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control
Authors: Kaizhen Zhu, Mokai Pan, Yuexin Ma, Yanwei Fu, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties
Authors: Jayanth Bhargav, Shreyas Sundaram, Mahsa Ghasemi
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.
