Title: Energy Efficient Wireless Communications by Harnessing Huygens' Metasurfaces
Authors: Maryam Rezvani, Raviraj Adve, Akram bin Sediq, Amr El-Keyi
Abstract: Ambitions for the next generation of wireless communication include high data rates, low latency, ubiquitous access, ensuring sustainability (in terms of consumption of energy and natural resources), all while maintaining a reasonable level of implementation complexity. Achieving these goals necessitates reforms in cellular networks, specifically in the physical layer and antenna design. The deployment of transmissive metasurfaces at basestations (BSs) presents an appealing solution, enabling beamforming in the radiated wave domain, minimizing the need for energy-hungry RF chains. Among various metasurface-based antenna designs, we propose using Huygens' metasurface-based antennas (HMAs) at BSs. Huygens' metasurfaces offer an attractive solution for antennas because, by utilizing Huygens' equivalence principle, they allow independent control over both the amplitude and phase of the transmitted electromagnetic wave. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of HMAs in wireless networks by integrating electromagnetic theory and information theory within a unified analytical framework. Specifically, we model the unique electromagnetic characteristics of HMAs and incorporate them into an information-theoretic optimization framework to determine their maximum achievable sum rate. By formulating an optimization problem that captures the impact of HMA's hardware constraints and electromagnetic properties, we quantify the channel capacity of HMA-assisted systems. We then compare the performance of HMAs against phased arrays and other metasurface-based antennas in both rich scattering and realistic 3GPP channels, highlighting their potential in improving spectral and energy efficiency.

Title: Climate Science and Control Engineering: Insights, Parallels, and Connections
Authors: Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: Climate science is the multidisciplinary field that studies the Earth's climate and its evolution. At the very core of climate science are indispensable climate models that predict future climate scenarios, inform policy decisions, and dictate how a country's economy should change in light of the changing climate. Climate models capture a wide range of interacting dynamic processes via extremely complex ordinary and partial differential equations. To model these large-scale complex processes, climate science leverages supercomputers, advanced simulations, and statistical methods to predict future climate. An area of engineering that is rarely studied in climate science is control engineering. Given that climate systems are inherently dynamic, it is intuitive to analyze them within the framework of dynamic system science. This perspective that has been underexplored in the literature. In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial that: (i) introduces the control engineering community to climate dynamics and modeling, including spatiotemporal scales and challenges in climate modeling; (ii) offers a fresh perspective on climate models from a control systems viewpoint; and (iii) explores the relevance and applicability of various advanced graph and network control-based approaches in building a physics-informed framework for learning, control and estimation in climate systems. We also present simple and then more complex climate models, depicting fundamental ideas and processes that are instrumental in building climate change projections. This tutorial also builds parallels and observes connections between various contemporary problems at the forefront of climate science and their control theoretic counterparts. We specifically observe that an abundance of climate science problems can be linguistically reworded and mathematically framed as control theoretic ones.

Title: Light Weight CNN for classification of Brain Tumors from MRI Images
Authors: Natnael Alemayehu
Abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.

Title: Generalised Label-free Artefact Cleaning for Real-time Medical Pulsatile Time Series
Authors: Xuhang Chen, Ihsane Olakorede, Stefan Yu Bögli, Wenhao Xu, Erta Beqiri, Xuemeng Li, Chenyu Tang, Zeyu Gao, Shuo Gao, Ari Ercole, Peter Smielewski
Abstract: Artefacts compromise clinical decision-making in the use of medical time series. Pulsatile waveforms offer probabilities for accurate artefact detection, yet most approaches rely on supervised manners and overlook patient-level distribution shifts. To address these issues, we introduce a generalised label-free framework, GenClean, for real-time artefact cleaning and leverage an in-house dataset of 180,000 ten-second arterial blood pressure (ABP) samples for training. We first investigate patient-level generalisation, demonstrating robust performances under both intra- and inter-patient distribution shifts. We further validate its effectiveness through challenging cross-disease cohort experiments on the MIMIC-III database. Additionally, we extend our method to photoplethysmography (PPG), highlighting its applicability to diverse medical pulsatile signals. Finally, its integration into ICM+, a clinical research monitoring software, confirms the real-time feasibility of our framework, emphasising its practical utility in continuous physiological monitoring. This work provides a foundational step toward precision medicine in improving the reliability of high-resolution medical time series analysis

Title: Gradient Attention Map Based Verification of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Application to X-ray Image Datasets
Authors: Omid Halimi Milani, Amanda Nikho, Lauren Mills, Marouane Tliba, Ahmet Enis Cetin, Mohammed H. Elnagar
Abstract: Deep learning models have great potential in medical imaging, including orthodontics and skeletal maturity assessment. However, applying a model to data different from its training set can lead to unreliable predictions that may impact patient care. To address this, we propose a comprehensive verification framework that evaluates model suitability through multiple complementary strategies. First, we introduce a Gradient Attention Map (GAM)-based approach that analyzes attention patterns using Grad-CAM and compares them via similarity metrics such as IoU, Dice Similarity, SSIM, Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. Second, we extend verification to early convolutional feature maps, capturing structural mis-alignments missed by attention alone. Finally, we incorporate an additional garbage class into the classification model to explicitly reject out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that these combined methods effectively identify unsuitable models and inputs, promoting safer and more reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging.

Title: Data-driven operator learning for energy-efficient building control
Authors: Yuexin Bian, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.

Title: Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using Gaussian Processes
Authors: Daniel Glover, Parikshit Pareek, Deepjyoti Deka, Anamika Dubey
Abstract: Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.

Title: Unified Network Modeling for Six Cross-Layer Scenarios in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Yalin Liu, Yaru Fu, Qubeijian Wang, Hong-Ning Dai
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) can enable global range and seamless coverage in the future network. SAGINs consist of three spatial layer network nodes: 1) satellites on the space layer, 2) aerial vehicles on the aerial layer, and 3) ground devices on the ground layer. Data transmissions in SAGINs include six unique cross-spatial-layer scenarios, i.e., three uplink and three downlink transmissions across three spatial layers. For simplicity, we call them \textit{six cross-layer scenarios}. Considering the diverse cross-layer scenarios, it is crucial to conduct a unified network modeling regarding node coverage and distributions in all scenarios. To achieve this goal, we develop a unified modeling approach of coverage regions for all six cross-layer scenarios. Given a receiver in each scenario, its coverage region on a transmitter-distributed surface is modeled as a spherical dome. Utilizing spherical geometry, the analytical models of the spherical-dome coverage regions are derived and unified for six cross-layer scenarios. We conduct extensive numerical results to examine the coverage models under varying carrier frequencies, receiver elevation angles, and transceivers' altitudes. Based on the coverage model, we develop an algorithm to generate node distributions under spherical coverage regions, which can assist in testing SAGINs before practical implementations.

Title: Reduced order asymptotic observer of friction in motion control
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Abstract: An asymptotic observer of the motion state variables with nonlinear friction [1] benefits from a robust to the noise state-space representation of the dynamic friction force, including pre-sliding transitions, and implements the reduced order Luenberger observation law with only measurable output displacement. The uniform asymptotic stability and convergence analysis of the proposed observer are elaborated by using the Lyapunov function-based stability criteria by Ignatyev and imposing the parametric constraints on the time dependent eigenvalues to be always negative real. A design procedure for assigning a dominant (thus slowest) real pole of the observer system matrix is proposed. A thorough experimental evaluation is given for the proposed observer-based friction compensation, which is performed for positioning and tracking tasks and compared with an optimally tuned PID feedback control.

Title: Waveform Design Based on Mutual Information Upper Bound For Joint Detection and Estimation
Authors: Ruofeng Yu, Caiguang Zhang, Chenyang Luo, Mengdi Bai, Shangqu Yan, Wei Yang, Yaowen Fu
Abstract: Adaptive radar waveform design grounded in information-theoretic principles is critical for advancing cognitive radar performance in complex environments. This paper investigates the optimization of phase-coded waveforms under constant modulus constraints to jointly enhance target detection and parameter estimation. We introduce a unified design framework based on maximizing a Mutual Information Upper Bound (MIUB), which inherently reconciles the trade-off between detection sensitivity and estimation precision without relying on ad hoc weighting schemes. To model realistic, potentially non-Gaussian statistics of target returns and clutter, we adopt Gaussian Mixture Distributions (GMDs), enabling analytically tractable approximations of the MIUB's constituent Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information terms. To address the resulting non-convex problem, we propose the Phase-Coded Dream Optimization Algorithm (PC-DOA), a tailored metaheuristic that leverages hybrid initialization and adaptive exploration-exploitation mechanisms specifically designed for phase-variable optimization. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving modestly better detection-estimation trade-off.

Title: Three-Stage Composite Outlier Identification of Wind Power Data: Integrating Physical Rules with Regression Learning and Mathematical Morphology
Authors: Limengqian Zheng, Lipeng Zhu, Weijia Wen, Jiayong Li, Cong Zhang
Abstract: Existing studies on identifying outliers in wind speed-power datasets are often challenged by the complicated and irregular distributions of outliers, especially those being densely stacked yet staying close to normal data. This could degrade their identification reliability and robustness in practice. To address this defect, this paper develops a three-stage composite outlier identification method by systematically integrating three complementary techniques, i.e., physical rule-based preprocessing, regression learning-enabled detection, and mathematical morphology-based refinement. Firstly, the raw wind speed-power data are preprocessed via a set of simple yet efficient physical rules to filter out some outliers obviously going against the physical operating laws of practical wind turbines. Secondly, a robust wind speed-power regression learning model is built upon the random sample consensus algorithm. This model is able to reliably detect most outliers with the help of an adaptive threshold automatically set by the interquartile range method. Thirdly, by representing the wind speed-power data distribution with a two-dimensional image, mathematical morphology operations are applied to perform refined outlier identification from a data distribution perspective. This technique can identify outliers that are not effectively detected in the first two stages, including those densely stacked ones near normal data points. By integrating the above three techniques, the whole method is capable of identifying various types of outliers in a reliable and adaptive manner. Numerical test results with wind power datasets acquired from distinct wind turbines in practice and from simulation environments extensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as well as its potential in enhancing wind power prediction.

Title: Electromagnetic Modelling of Extended Targets in a Distributed Antenna System
Authors: Baptiste Sambon, François De Saint Moulin, Guillaume Thiran, Claude Oestges, Luc Vandendorpe
Abstract: Traditional radar and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems often approximate targets as point sources, a simplification that fails to capture the essential scattering characteristics for many applications. This paper presents a novel electromagnetic (EM)-based framework to accurately model the near-field (NF) scattering response of extended targets, which is then applied to three canonical shapes : a flat rectangular plate, a sphere and a cylinder. Mathematical expressions for the received signal are provided in each case. Based on this model, the influence of bandwidth, carrier frequency and target distance on localisation accuracy is analysed, showing how higher bandwidths and carrier frequencies improve resolution. Additionally, the impact of target curvature on localisation performance is studied. Results indicate that detection performance is slightly enhanced when considering curved objects. A comparative analysis between the extended and point target models shows significant similarities when targets are small and curved. However, as the target size increases or becomes flatter, the point target model introduces estimation errors owing to model mismatch. The impact of this model mismatch as a function of system parameters is analysed, and the operational zones where the point abstraction remains valid and where it breaks down are identified. These findings provide theoretical support for experimental results based on point-target models in previous studies.

Title: Towards Intelligent Edge Sensing for ISCC Network: Joint Multi-Tier DNN Partitioning and Beamforming Design
Authors: Peng Liu, Zesong Fei, Xinyi Wang, Xiaoyang Li, Weijie Yuan, Yuanhao Li, Cheng Hu, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: The combination of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) enables devices to simultaneously sense the environment and offload data to the base stations (BS) for intelligent processing, thereby reducing local computational burdens. However, transmitting raw sensing data from ISAC devices to the BS often incurs substantial fronthaul overhead and latency. This paper investigates a three-tier collaborative inference framework enabled by Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computing (ISCC), where cloud servers, MEC servers, and ISAC devices cooperatively execute different segments of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for intelligent sensing. By offloading intermediate DNN features, the proposed framework can significantly reduce fronthaul transmission load. Furthermore, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is employed to enhance both sensing quality and offloading efficiency. To minimize the overall sensing task inference latency across all ISAC devices, we jointly optimize the DNN partitioning strategy, ISAC beamforming, and computational resource allocation at the MEC servers and devices, subject to sensing beampattern constraints. We also propose an efficient two-layer optimization algorithm. In the inner layer, we derive closed-form solutions for computational resource allocation using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Moreover, we design the ISAC beamforming vectors via an iterative method based on the majorization-minimization and weighted minimum mean square error techniques. In the outer layer, we develop a cross-entropy based probabilistic learning algorithm to determine an optimal DNN partitioning strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially outperforms existing two-tier schemes in inference latency.

Title: Stability of Open Multi-agent Systems over Dynamic Signed Graphs
Authors: Pelin Sekercioglu, Angela Fontan, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: This paper addresses the bipartite consensus-control problem in open multi-agent systems containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions. In these systems, new agents can join and new interactions can be formed over time. Moreover, the types of interactions, cooperative or antagonistic, may change. To model these structural changes, we represent the system as a switched system interconnected over a dynamic signed graph. Using the signed edge-based agreement protocol and constructing strict Lyapunov functions for signed edge-Laplacian matrices with multiple zero eigenvalues, we establish global asymptotic stability of the bipartite consensus control. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Authors: Chuanmin Jia, Feng Ye, Siwei Ma, Wen Gao, Huifang Sun, Leonardo Chiariglione
Abstract: Video compression is a fundamental topic in the visual intelligence, bridging visual signal sensing/capturing and high-level visual analytics. The broad success of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enriched the horizon of video compression into novel paradigms by leveraging end-to-end optimized neural models. In this survey, we first provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent literature on end-to-end optimized learned video coding, covering the spectrum of pioneering efforts in both uni-directional and bi-directional prediction based compression model designation. We further delve into the optimization techniques employed in learned video compression (LVC), emphasizing their technical innovations, advantages. Some standardization progress is also reported. Furthermore, we investigate the system design and hardware implementation challenges of the LVC inclusively. Finally, we present the extensive simulation results to demonstrate the superior compression performance of LVC models, addressing the question that why learned codecs and AI-based video technology would have with broad impact on future visual intelligence research.

Title: Anti-Intercept OFDM Waveform Design with Secure Coding for Satellite Networks
Authors: Zhisheng Yin, Yonghong Liu, Dongbo Li, Nan Cheng, Linlin Liang, Changle Li, Jie Liu
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are integral to next-generation communication systems, providing global coverage, low latency, and minimal signal loss. However, their unique characteristics, such as constrained onboard resources, Line-of-Sight (LoS) propagation, and vulnerability to eavesdropping over wide coverage areas, present significant challenges to physical layer security. To address these challenges, this paper focuses on the design of anti-intercept waveforms for satellite-ground links within Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, aiming to enhance security against eavesdropping threats. We formulate a secrecy rate maximization problem that aims to balance secrecy performance and communication reliability under eavesdropping constraints and sub-carrier power limitations. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a bisection search-activated neural network (BSA-Net) that integrates unsupervised learning for secure coding optimization and bisection search for dynamic power allocation. The proposed method is structured in two stages: the first optimizes secure coding under power constraints, while the second allocates power across sub-carriers under eavesdropping constraints. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant improvements in secrecy rate performance.

Title: On phase in scaled graphs
Authors: Sebastiaan van den Eijnden, Chao Chen, Koen Scheres, Thomas Chaffey, Alexander Lanzon
Abstract: The scaled graph has been introduced recently as a nonlinear extension of the classical Nyquist plot for linear time-invariant systems. In this paper, we introduce a modified definition for the scaled graph, termed the signed scaled graph (SSG), in which the phase component is characterized by making use of the Hilbert transform. Whereas the original definition of the scaled graph uses unsigned phase angles, the new definition has signed phase angles which ensures the possibility to differentiate between phase-lead and phase-lag properties in a system. Making such distinction is important from both an analysis and a synthesis perspective, and helps in providing tighter stability estimates of feedback interconnections. We show how the proposed SSG leads to intuitive characterizations of positive real and negative imaginary nonlinear systems, and present various interconnection results. We showcase the effectiveness of our results through several motivating examples.

Title: Adaptive Neural Control with Desired Approximation: An Integral Lyapunov Function Approach
Authors: Mingxuan Sun, Shengxiang Zou
Abstract: The inherent approximation ability of neural networks plays an essential role in adaptive neural control, where the prerequisite for existence of the compact set is crucial in the control designs. Instead of using practical system state, in this paper, the desired approximation approach is characterized to tackle such a problem, where the desired state signal is required only as the input to the network. An integral Lyapunov function-based adaptive controller is designed, in the sense of the error tracking, where the treatment of the state-dependent input gain is adopted. Theoretical results for the performance analysis of the integral and incremental adaptation algorithms are presented in details. In particular, the boundedness of the variables in the closed-loop is characterized, while the transient performance of the output error is analytically quantified. It is shown that the proposed control schemes assure that the tracking error converges to an adjustable set without any requirement on the knowledge of the region that the practical variables evolve, and remove the requirement for the setting of initial conditions including system states and weight estimates.

Title: Impairments are Clustered in Latents of Deep Neural Network-based Speech Quality Models
Authors: Fredrik Cumlin, Xinyu Liang, Victor Ungureanu, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Christian Schüldt, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: In this article, we provide an experimental observation: Deep neural network (DNN) based speech quality assessment (SQA) models have inherent latent representations where many types of impairments are clustered. While DNN-based SQA models are not trained for impairment classification, our experiments show good impairment classification results in an appropriate SQA latent representation. We investigate the clustering of impairments using various kinds of audio degradations that include different types of noises, waveform clipping, gain transition, pitch shift, compression, reverberation, etc. To visualize the clusters we perform classification of impairments in the SQA-latent representation domain using a standard k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier. We also develop a new DNN-based SQA model, named DNSMOS+, to examine whether an improvement in SQA leads to an improvement in impairment classification. The classification accuracy is 94% for LibriAugmented dataset with 16 types of impairments and 54% for ESC-50 dataset with 50 types of real noises.

Title: Random Features for Grassmannian Kernels
Authors: Rémi Delogne, Laurent Jacques
Abstract: The Grassmannian manifold G(k, n) serves as a fundamental tool in signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning, where problems often involve classifying, clustering, or comparing subspaces. In this work, we propose a sketching-based approach to approximate Grassmannian kernels using random projections. We introduce three variations of kernel approximation, including two that rely on binarised sketches, offering substantial memory gains. We establish theoretical properties of our method in the special case of G(1, n) and extend it to general G(k, n). Experimental validation demonstrates that our sketched kernels closely match the performance of standard Grassmannian kernels while avoiding the need to compute or store the full kernel matrix. Our approach enables scalable Grassmannian-based methods for large-scale applications in machine learning and pattern recognition.

Title: Leveraging Systems and Control Theory for Social Robotics: A Model-Based Behavioral Control Approach to Human-Robot Interaction
Authors: Maria Morão Patrício, Anahita Jamshidnejad
Abstract: Social robots (SRs) should autonomously interact with humans, while exhibiting proper social behaviors associated to their role. By contributing to health-care, education, and companionship, SRs will enhance life quality. However, personalization and sustaining user engagement remain a challenge for SRs, due to their limited understanding of human mental states. Accordingly, we leverage a recently introduced mathematical dynamic model of human perception, cognition, and decision-making for SRs. Identifying the parameters of this model and deploying it in behavioral steering system of SRs allows to effectively personalize the responses of SRs to evolving mental states of their users, enhancing long-term engagement and personalization. Our approach uniquely enables autonomous adaptability of SRs by modeling the dynamics of invisible mental states, significantly contributing to the transparency and awareness of SRs. We validated our model-based control system in experiments with 10 participants who interacted with a Nao robot over three chess puzzle sessions, 45 - 90 minutes each. The identified model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.067 (i.e., 1.675% of the maximum possible MSE) in tracking beliefs, goals, and emotions of participants. Compared to a model-free controller that did not track mental states of participants, our approach increased engagement by 16% on average. Post-interaction feedback of participants (provided via dedicated questionnaires) further confirmed the perceived engagement and awareness of the model-driven robot. These results highlight the unique potential of model-based approaches and control theory in advancing human-SR interactions.

Title: Make Both Ends Meet: A Synergistic Optimization Infrared Small Target Detection with Streamlined Computational Overhead
Authors: Yuxin Jing, Yuchen Zheng, Jufeng Zhao, Guangmang Cui, Yiming Zhu, Tianpei Zhang
Abstract: Infrared small target detection(IRSTD) is widely recognized as a challenging task due to the inherent limitations of infrared imaging, including low signal-to-noise ratios, lack of texture details, and complex background interference. While most existing methods model IRSTD as a semantic segmentation task, but they suffer from two critical drawbacks: (1)blurred target boundaries caused by long-distance imaging dispersion; and (2) excessive computational overhead due to indiscriminate feature stackin. To address these issues, we propose the Lightweight Efficiency Infrared Small Target Detection (LE-IRSTD), a lightweight and efficient framework based on YOLOv8n, with following key innovations. Firstly, we identify that the multiple bottleneck structures within the C2f component of the YOLOv8-n backbone contribute to an increased computational burden. Therefore, we implement the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution block (MBConvblock) and Bottleneck Structure block (BSblock) in the backbone, effectively balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and the extraction of deep semantic information. Secondly, we introduce the Attention-based Variable Convolution Stem (AVCStem) structure, substituting the final convolution with Variable Kernel Convolution (VKConv), which allows for adaptive convolutional kernels that can transform into various shapes, facilitating the receptive field for the extraction of targets. Finally, we employ Global Shuffle Convolution (GSConv) to shuffle the channel dimension features obtained from different convolutional approaches, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our LE-IRSTD method achieves compelling results in both accuracy and lightweight performance, outperforming several state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

Title: A Protection-Interoperable Fault Ride-Through Control for Grid-Forming Inverters
Authors: Yifei Li, Heng Wu, Xiongfei Wang
Abstract: Differing from synchronous generators (SGs), grid-forming inverter-based resources (GFM-IBRs) exhibit rapid variations in their output impedances during transmission line faults due to the overcurrent limitation. As a result, the source dynamics during the fault period deviate significantly from those under pre-fault conditions. This fundamental difference alters the fault responses of incremental quantities, thereby jeopardizing the reliability of the supervising elements in protective relays that are based on these quantities. To address this challenge, a protection-interoperable fault ride-through (FRT) method for GFM-IBRs is proposed. This method dynamically adjusts power control of GFM-IBRs in response to the changes in output impedance, effectively mitigating variations in source dynamics and thereby preserving the reliability of incremental quantity-based supervising elements. This method also ensures effective overcurrent limitation and transient stability of GFM-IBRs. Controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) and experimental tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Switching Transients in Constrained Transformer-Line/Cable Configurations
Authors: Y. Xiang, L. Wu, K. Velitsikakis, A.L.J. Janssen
Abstract: This paper investigates the transient phenomena that occur in two special cases in the Netherlands: (A) during the energization of a power transformer via a cable feeder and (B) the energization of a power transformer together with an overhead line (OHL). In Case A a 7 km long 150 kV cable and a 150/50 kV transformer are connected and energized at the same time. In Case B a 150/50 kV transformer and a short 50 kV OHL are connected and energized simultaneously. The reason behind this kind of situations is related to space restrictions and cost efficiency.

Title: Measurement-Based Line-Impedance Estimation in the Absence of Phasor Measurement Units
Authors: Plouton Grammatikos, Ali Mohamed Ali, Fabrizio Sossan
Abstract: This paper proposes and compares experimentally several methods to estimate the series resistance and reactance (i.e., the transversal components of the $\pi$-model of a line) of low-voltage lines in distribution grids. It first shows that if phasor measurements are available and the grid nodal voltages and power injections are known, the problem can be formulated and solved as a conventional load flow with properly adjusted unknowns. To solve this problem, we propose an analytical derivation of the Jacobian matrix. If only RMS values are available, such as from smart meters, integrating information from multiple intervals becomes necessary, ultimately opening to least-squares estimations, widely adopted in the literature. In this context, applying the proposed Jacobian contributes to accelerating the problem resolution of existing algorithms. The methods are compared in terms of estimation performance and convergence by using measurements from an experimental distribution grid interfacing real-world components and with realistic size implemented at the Gridlab at HES-SO Valais.

Title: Selective Variable Convolution Meets Dynamic Content Guided Attention for Infrared Small Target Detection
Authors: Yirui Chen, Yiming Zhu, Yuxin Jing, Tianpei Zhang, Yuchen Zheng
Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) system aims to identify small targets in complex backgrounds. Due to the convolution operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), applying traditional CNNs to IRSTD presents challenges, since the feature extraction of small targets is often insufficient, resulting in the loss of critical features. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic content guided attention multiscale feature aggregation network (DCGANet), which adheres to the attention principle of 'coarse-to-fine' and achieves high detection accuracy. First, we propose a selective variable convolution (SVC) module that integrates the benefits of standard convolution, irregular deformable convolution, and multi-rate dilated convolution. This module is designed to expand the receptive field and enhance non-local features, thereby effectively improving the discrimination of targets from backgrounds. Second, the core component of DCGANet is a two-stage content guided attention module. This module employs two-stage attention mechanism to initially direct the network's focus to salient regions within the feature maps and subsequently determine whether these regions correspond to targets or background interference. By retaining the most significant responses, this mechanism effectively suppresses false alarms. Additionally, we propose adaptive dynamic feature fusion (ADFF) module to substitute for static feature cascading. This dynamic feature fusion strategy enables DCGANet to adaptively integrate contextual features, thereby enhancing its ability to discriminate true targets from false alarms. DCGANet has achieved new benchmarks across multiple datasets.

Title: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting of Residential Loads -- A Copula Approach
Authors: Marco Jeschke, Timm Faulwasser, Roland Fried
Abstract: Predicting the time series of future evolutions of renewable injections and demands is of utmost importance for the operation of power systems. However, the current state of the art is mostly focused on mean-value time series predictions and only very few methods provide probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we rely on kernel density estimation and vine copulas to construct probabilistic models for individual load profiles of private households. Our approach allows the quantification of variability of individual energy consumption in general and of daily peak loads in particular. We draw upon an Australian distribution grid dataset to illustrate our findings. We generate synthetic loads that follow the distribution of the real data.

Title: Assimilation of SWOT Altimetry Data for Riverine Flood Reanalysis: From Synthetic to Real Data
Authors: Quentin Bonassies, Thanh Huy Nguyen, Ludovic Cassan, Andrea Piacentini, Sophie Ricci, Charlotte Emery, Christophe Fatras, Santiago Peña Luque, Raquel Rodriguez Suquet
Abstract: Floods are one of the most common and devastating natural disasters worldwide. The contribution of remote sensing is important for reducing the impact of flooding both during the event itself and for improving hydrodynamic models by reducing their associated uncertainties. This article presents the innovative capabilities of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, especially its river node products, to enhance the accuracy of riverine flood reanalysis, performed on a 50-km stretch of the Garonne River. The experiments incorporate various data assimilation strategies, based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which allows for sequential updates of model parameters based on available observations. The experimental results show that while SWOT data alone offers some improvements, combining it with in-situ water level measurements provides the most accurate representation of flood dynamics, both at gauge stations and along the river. The study also investigates the impact of different SWOT revisit frequencies on the models performance, revealing that assimilating more frequent SWOT observations leads to more reliable flood reanalyses. In the real event, it was demonstrated that the assimilation of SWOT and in-situ data accurately reproduces the water level dynamics, offering promising prospects for future flood monitoring systems. Overall, this study emphasizes the complementary strengths of Earth Observation data in improving the representation of the flood dynamics in the riverbed and the floodplains.

Title: Task-Agnostic Semantic Communications Relying on Information Bottleneck and Federated Meta-Learning
Authors: Hao Wei, Wen Wang, Wanli Ni, Wenjun Xu, Yongming Huang, Dusit Niyato, Ping Zhang
Abstract: As a paradigm shift towards pervasive intelligence, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potentials to improve communication efficiency and provide user-centric services by delivering task-oriented semantic meanings. However, the exponential growth in connected devices, data volumes, and communication demands presents significant challenges for practical SemCom design, particularly in resource-constrained wireless networks. In this work, we first propose a task-agnostic SemCom (TASC) framework that can handle diverse tasks with multiple modalities. Aiming to explore the interplay between communications and intelligent tasks from the information-theoretical perspective, we leverage information bottleneck (IB) theory and propose a distributed multimodal IB (DMIB) principle to learn minimal and sufficient unimodal and multimodal information effectively by discarding redundancy while preserving task-related information. To further reduce the communication overhead, we develop an adaptive semantic feature transmission method under dynamic channel conditions. Then, TASC is trained based on federated meta-learning (FML) for rapid adaptation and generalization in wireless networks. To gain deep insights, we rigorously conduct theoretical analysis and devise resource management to accelerate convergence while minimizing the training latency and energy consumption. Moreover, we develop a joint user selection and resource allocation algorithm to address the non-convex problem with theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TASC compared to baselines.

Title: Smart Environmental Monitoring of Marine Pollution using Edge AI
Authors: Mohamed Moursi, Norbert Wehn, Bilal Hammoud
Abstract: Oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems and coastal environments, necessitating rapid detection and monitoring capabilities to mitigate environmental damage. In this paper, we demonstrate how artificial intelligence, despite the inherent high computational and memory requirements, can be efficiently integrated into marine pollution monitoring systems. More precisely, we propose a drone-based smart monitoring system leveraging a compressed deep learning U-Net architecture for oil spill detection and thickness estimation. Compared to the standard U-Net architecture, the number of convolution blocks and channels per block are modified. The new model is then trained on synthetic radar data to accurately predict thick oil slick thickness up to 10 mm. Results show that our optimized Tiny U-Net achieves superior performance with an Intersection over Union (IoU) metric of approximately 79%, while simultaneously reducing the model size by a factor of $\sim$269x compared to the state-of-the-art. This significant model compression enables efficient edge computing deployment on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware integrated directly into the drone platform. Hardware implementation demonstrates near real-time thickness estimation capabilities with a run-time power consumption of approximately 2.2 watts. Our findings highlight the increasing potential of smart monitoring technologies and efficient edge computing for operational characterization in marine environments.

Title: LoC-LIC: Low Complexity Learned Image Coding Using Hierarchical Feature Transforms
Authors: Ayman A. Ameen, Thomas Richter, André Kaup
Abstract: Current learned image compression models typically exhibit high complexity, which demands significant computational resources. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that employs hierarchical feature extraction transforms to significantly reduce complexity while preserving bit rate reduction efficiency. Our novel architecture achieves this by using fewer channels for high spatial resolution inputs/feature maps. On the other hand, feature maps with a large number of channels have reduced spatial dimensions, thereby cutting down on computational load without sacrificing performance. This strategy effectively reduces the forward pass complexity from \(1256 \, \text{kMAC/Pixel}\) to just \(270 \, \text{kMAC/Pixel}\). As a result, the reduced complexity model can open the way for learned image compression models to operate efficiently across various devices and pave the way for the development of new architectures in image compression technology.

Title: From Aesthetics to Human Preferences: Comparative Perspectives of Evaluating Text-to-Music Systems
Authors: Huan Zhang, Jinhua Liang, Huy Phan, Wenwu Wang, Emmanouil Benetos
Abstract: Evaluating generative models remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when the goal is to reflect human preferences. In this paper, we use music generation as a case study to investigate the gap between automatic evaluation metrics and human preferences. We conduct comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art music generation approaches, assessing both perceptual quality and distributional similarity to human-composed music. Specifically, we evaluate synthesis music from various perceptual dimensions and examine reference-based metrics such as Mauve Audio Divergence (MAD) and Kernel Audio Distance (KAD). Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies across the different metrics, highlighting the limitation of the current evaluation practice. To support further research, we release a benchmark dataset comprising samples from multiple models. This study provides a broader perspective on the alignment of human preference in generative modeling, advocating for more human-centered evaluation strategies across domains.

Title: Optimal Dynamic Control of Bounded Jacobian Discrete-Time Systems via Interval Observers
Authors: Mohammad Khajenejad
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal dynamic control framework for bounded Jacobian nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems with nonlinear observations affected by both state and process noise. Rather than directly stabilizing the uncertain system, we focus on stabilizing an interval observer in a higher dimensional space, whose states bound the true system states. Our nonlinear dynamic control method introduces added flexibility over traditional static and linear approaches, effectively compensating for system nonlinearities and enabling potentially tighter closed-loop intervals. Additionally, we establish a separation principle that allows for the design of observer and control gains. We further derive tractable matrix inequalities to ensure system stability in the closed-loop configuration. The simulation results show that the proposed dynamic control approach significantly outperforms a static counterpart method.

Title: Feasibility assessment of optical communications between ground and satellite on Mars through the simulation of atmospheric effects on signal quality leading to a proposal for a new communications network architecture during extreme weather
Authors: Zachary C. Rowland, Eva Fernandez Rodriguez
Abstract: Mars is the next milestone in human exploration. However, there are still several challenges that must be assessed to ensure appropriate conditions in a future settlement. Communications services will be essential for this task, providing not only a link between Earth and Mars but also supporting Martian weather forecasting and any potential rescue missions. These applications require a robust, high data rate communications network that allows for rapid response, remote sensing and public engagement. This research aims to study the feasibility of ground-to-satellite (and vice versa) optical communications during extreme Martian weather conditions, focusing on the link between a ground station on the surface of Mars and a satellite orbiting the planet. Long-lasting and expansive Martian dust storms, particularly common in the southern hemisphere, pose a considerable challenge when considering the feasibility of optical communications with Mars due to their significant impact in terms of signal attenuation and scattering. The methodology of this study is based on a computer simulation of the system featuring the characterisation of the Martian atmosphere and optical link to measure the attenuation and undesired effects suffered by the data signal when applying different environmental configuration parameters. The flexibility of the approach allows for the prediction of communications link quality in extreme cases such as global dust storms. The simulation is based on atmospheric data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder instrument and considers the recently launched Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The extreme conditions during dust storms in the southern polar-hood region lead to the proposal of a new communications network architecture to ensure connectivity during these events.

Title: Design, analysis, and experimental validation of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker
Authors: Woongji Kim, Beomseok Oh, Chayeong Kim, Wonkyu Moon
Abstract: This study investigates the design and analysis of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker (SPPAL) as an alternative to conventional array-based parametric loudspeakers. The SPPAL utilizes a single Langevin-type ultrasonic transducer coupled with a flexural stepped plate to generate narrow-beam audible sound via nonlinear acoustic interaction. To evaluate and optimize the performance of the SPPAL, an integrated modeling framework is developed, consisting of an approximate analytical 3D model for transducer dynamics, an equivalence ratio formulation to relate stepped plate and rigid piston behavior, and a spherical wave expansion method for nonlinear sound field simulation. The dual-resonance behavior of the transducer is optimized through multi-objective analysis to enhance low-frequency audio performance. Experimental validation includes frequency response and modal analysis of the transducer, as well as sound field measurements. The analytical methods are further verified through comparison with experimental data. Furthermore, combination resonance--an unintended structural excitation resulting from intermodulation--is identified as an inherent phenomenon in SPPAL operation. The findings offer practical guidance for the development of efficient, compact, and manufacturable parametric array loudspeakers employing plate-based flexural vibration.

Title: Green Satellite Networks Using Segment Routing and Software-Defined Networking
Authors: Jintao Liang, Pablo G. Madoery, Chung-Horng Lung, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Gunes Karabulut Kurt
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of network performance in software defined networking (SDN)-based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, focusing on the Telesat Lightspeed constellation. We propose a green traffic engineering (TE) approach leveraging segment routing IPv6 (SRv6) to enhance energy efficiency. Through simulations, we analyze the impact of SRv6, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS), IPv4, and IPv6 with open shortest path first (OSPF) on key network performance metrics, including peak and average CPU usage, memory consumption, packet delivery rate (PDR), and packet overhead under varying traffic loads. Results show that the proposed green TE approach using SRv6 achieves notable energy efficiency, maintaining lower CPU usage and high PDR compared to traditional protocols. While SRv6 and MPLS introduce slightly higher memory usage and overhead due to their advanced configurations, these trade-offs remain manageable. Our findings highlight SRv6 with green TE as a promising solution for optimizing energy efficiency in LEO satellite networks, contributing to the development of more sustainable and efficient satellite communications.

Title: Pretraining Large Brain Language Model for Active BCI: Silent Speech
Authors: Jinzhao Zhou, Zehong Cao, Yiqun Duan, Connor Barkley, Daniel Leong, Xiaowei Jiang, Quoc-Toan Nguyen, Ziyi Zhao, Thomas Do, Yu-Cheng Chang, Sheng-Fu Liang, Chin-teng Lin
Abstract: This paper explores silent speech decoding in active brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which offer more natural and flexible communication than traditional BCI applications. We collected a new silent speech dataset of over 120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing 24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding. Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike existing EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction paradigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal and frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from EEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session setting, our model achieves 47.0\% accuracy on semantic-level classification and 39.6\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by 5.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Our research advances silent speech decoding in active BCI systems, offering an innovative solution for EEG language model pretraining and a new dataset for fundamental research.

Title: A Koopman Operator-based NMPC Framework for Mobile Robot Navigation under Uncertainty
Authors: Xiaobin Zhang, Mohamed Karim Bouafoura, Lu Shi, Konstantinos Karydis
Abstract: Mobile robot navigation can be challenged by system uncertainty. For example, ground friction may vary abruptly causing slipping, and noisy sensor data can lead to inaccurate feedback control. Traditional model-based methods may be limited when considering such variations, making them fragile to varying types of uncertainty. One way to address this is by leveraging learned prediction models by means of the Koopman operator into nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). This paper describes the formulation of, and provides the solution to, an NMPC problem using a lifted bilinear model that can accurately predict affine input systems with stochastic perturbations. System constraints are defined in the Koopman space, while the optimization problem is solved in the state space to reduce computational complexity. Training data to estimate the Koopman operator for the system are given via randomized control inputs. The output of the developed method enables closed-loop navigation control over environments populated with obstacles. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested through numerical simulations using a wheeled robot with additive stochastic velocity perturbations, Gazebo simulations with a realistic digital twin robot, and physical hardware experiments without knowledge of the true dynamics.

Title: Redundancy Analysis and Mitigation for Machine Learning-Based Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing
Authors: Jiarui Xie, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao
Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.

Title: Physics-informed Gaussian Processes for Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Adrian Lepp, Jörn Tebbe, Andreas Besginow
Abstract: Recently, a novel linear model predictive control algorithm based on a physics-informed Gaussian Process has been introduced, whose realizations strictly follow a system of underlying linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. The control task is formulated as an inference problem by conditioning the Gaussian process prior on the setpoints and incorporating pointwise soft-constraints as further virtual setpoints. We apply this method to systems of nonlinear differential equations, obtaining a local approximation through the linearization around an equilibrium point. In the case of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point convergence is given through the Bayesian inference schema of the Gaussian Process. Results for this are demonstrated in a numerical example.

Title: An Inversion Theorem for Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) Matrices and Applications to Streaming Differential Privacy
Authors: H. Brendan McMahan, Krishna Pillutla
Abstract: Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) matrices are a family of parameterized lower-triangular matrices that play an important role in streaming differential privacy with correlated noise. Our main result is a BLT inversion theorem: the inverse of a BLT matrix is itself a BLT matrix with different parameters. We also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original BLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of BLT parameters for privacy mechanisms through automatic differentiation.

Title: Multi-Goal Dexterous Hand Manipulation using Probabilistic Model-based Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yingzhuo Jiang, Wenjun Huang, Rongdun Lin, Chenyang Miao, Tianfu Sun, Yunduan Cui
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning multi-goal dexterous hand manipulation tasks using model-based Reinforcement Learning. We propose Goal-Conditioned Probabilistic Model Predictive Control (GC-PMPC) by designing probabilistic neural network ensembles to describe the high-dimensional dexterous hand dynamics and introducing an asynchronous MPC policy to meet the control frequency requirements in real-world dexterous hand systems. Extensive evaluations on four simulated Shadow Hand manipulation scenarios with randomly generated goals demonstrate GC-PMPC's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. It successfully drives a cable-driven Dexterous hand, DexHand 021 with 12 Active DOFs and 5 tactile sensors, to learn manipulating a cubic die to three goal poses within approximately 80 minutes of interactions, demonstrating exceptional learning efficiency and control performance on a cost-effective dexterous hand platform.

Title: One Net to Rule Them All: Domain Randomization in Quadcopter Racing Across Different Platforms
Authors: Robin Ferede, Till Blaha, Erin Lucassen, Christophe De Wagter, Guido C.H.E. de Croon
Abstract: In high-speed quadcopter racing, finding a single controller that works well across different platforms remains challenging. This work presents the first neural network controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically distinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain randomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network relies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The effectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world tests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race quadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller with controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using their identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower speeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across different platforms. Our results show that no randomization fails sim-to-real transfer while increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces speed. Despite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential of domain randomization for generalizing controllers, paving the way for universal AI controllers that can adapt to any platform.

Title: Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification
Authors: Fuma Ito, Chihiro Tsutake, Keita Takahashi, Toshiaki Fujii
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation~(DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.

Title: Sionna RT: Technical Report
Authors: Fayçal Aït Aoudia, Jakob Hoydis, Merlin Nimier-David, Sebastian Cammerer, Alexander Keller
Abstract: Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14, incorporates a ray tracer for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique feature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of gradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other related metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of Sionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly improving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document details the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation efficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the computation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are detailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and bouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism to efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a purely SBR-based approach.

Title: Generalizing Biased Backpressure Routing and Scheduling to Wireless Multi-hop Networks with Advanced Air-interfaces
Authors: Zhongyuan Zhao, Yujun Ming, Ananthram Swami, Kevin Chan, Fikadu Dagefu, Santiago Segarra
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is a well-established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, known for its fully distributed operations and proven maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walk, but exclusive link-level commodity selection still suffers from the last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. Moreover, classic BP routing implicitly assumes single-input-single-output (SISO) transceivers, which can lead to the same packets being scheduled on multiple outgoing links for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers, causing detouring and looping in MIMO networks. In this paper, we revisit the foundational Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP routing and demonstrate that exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and instead propose a Max-Utility link-sharing method. Additionally, we generalize MaxWeight scheduling to MIMO networks by introducing attributed capacity hypergraphs (ACH), an extension of traditional conflict graphs for SISO networks, and by incorporating backlog reassignment into scheduling iterations to prevent redundant packet routing. Numerical evaluations show that our approach substantially mitigates the last-packet problem in state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP-BP under lightweight traffic, and slightly expands the network capacity region for heavier traffic.

Title: Obstructive Sleep Apnea Characterization: A Multimodal Cross-Recurrence-Based Approach for Investigating Atrial Fibrillation
Authors: Mantas Rinkevičius, Jesús Lázaro, Eduardo Gil, Pablo Laguna, Peter H. Charlton, Raquel Bailón, Vaidotas Marozas
Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is believed to contribute significantly to atrial fibrillation (AF) development in certain patients. Recent studies indicate a rising risk of AF with increasing OSA severity. However, the commonly used apnea-hypopnea index in clinical practice may not adequately account for the potential cardiovascular risks associated with OSA. (1) Objective: to propose and explore a novel method for assessing OSA severity considering potential connection to cardiac arrhythmias. (2) Method: the approach utilizes cross-recurrence features to characterize OSA and AF by considering the relationships among oxygen desaturation, pulse arrival time, and heart-beat intervals. Multinomial logistic regression models were trained to predict four levels of OSA severity and four groups related to heart rhythm issues. The rank biserial correlation coefficient, rrb, was used to estimate effect size for statistical analysis. The investigation was conducted using the MESA database, which includes polysomnography data from 2055 subjects. (3) Results: a derived cross-recurrence-based index showed a significant association with a higher OSA severity (p < 0.01) and the presence of AF (p < 0.01). Additionally, the proposed index had a significantly larger effect, rrb, than the conventional apnea-hypopnea index in differentiating increasingly severe heart rhythm issue groups: 0.14 > 0.06, 0.33 > 0.10, and 0.41 > 0.07. (4) Significance: the proposed method holds relevance as a supplementary diagnostic tool for assessing the authentic state of sleep apnea in clinical practice.

Title: Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance
Authors: Atoosa Kasirzadeh, Iason Gabriel
Abstract: The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world. This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems. Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity, this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with collective societal goals.

Title: From Discrete to Continuous Binary Best-Response Dynamics: Discrete Fluctuations Almost Surely Vanish with Population Size
Authors: Azadeh Aghaeeyan, Pouria Ramazi
Abstract: In binary decision-making, individuals often choose either the rare or the common action. In the framework of evolutionary game theory, the best-response update rule can be used to model this dichotomy. Those who prefer the common action are called \emph{coordinators}, and those who prefer the rare one are called \emph{anticoordinators}. A finite mixed population of the two types may undergo perpetual fluctuations, the characterization of which appears to be challenging. It is particularly unknown whether the fluctuations persist as population size grows. To fill this gap, we approximate the discrete finite population dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators with the associated mean dynamics in the form of differential inclusions. We show that the family of the state sequences of the discrete dynamics for increasing population sizes forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for the differential inclusion. On the other hand, we show that the differential inclusions always converge to an equilibrium. This implies that the reported perpetual fluctuations in the finite discrete dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators almost surely vanish with population size. The results encourage to first analyze the often simpler {continuous-time} mean dynamics of the discrete population dynamics as the continuous-time dynamics partly reveal the asymptotic behavior of the discrete dynamics.

Title: Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage Considering Strategic Capacity Withholding and Decision-Dependent Uncertainty
Authors: Ning Qi, Pierre Pinson, Mads R. Almassalkhi, Yingrui Zhuang, Yifan Su, Feng Liu
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed data-driven distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.

Title: Improving the Robustness and Clinical Applicability of Automatic Respiratory Sound Classification Using Deep Learning-Based Audio Enhancement: Algorithm Development and Validation
Authors: Jing-Tong Tzeng, Jeng-Lin Li, Huan-Yu Chen, Chun-Hsiang Huang, Chi-Hsin Chen, Cheng-Yi Fan, Edward Pei-Chuan Huang, Chi-Chun Lee
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in the automatic classification of respiratory sounds. However, accurately distinguishing these sounds in real-world noisy conditions remains challenging for clinical deployment. In addition, predicting signals with only background noise may reduce user trust in the system. This study explores the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating a deep learning-based audio enhancement step into automatic respiratory sound classification systems to improve robustness and clinical applicability. We conducted extensive experiments using various audio enhancement model architectures, including time-domain and time-frequency-domain approaches, combined with multiple classification models to evaluate the module's effectiveness. The classification performance was compared against the noise injection data augmentation method. These experiments were carried out on two datasets: the ICBHI respiratory sound dataset and the FABS dataset. Furthermore, a physician validation study assessed the system's clinical utility. Integrating the audio enhancement module resulted in a 21.9% increase in the ICBHI classification score and a 4.1% improvement on the FABS dataset in multi-class noisy scenarios. Quantitative analysis revealed efficiency gains, higher diagnostic confidence, and increased trust, with workflows using enhanced audio improving diagnostic sensitivity by 11.6% and enabling high-confidence diagnoses. Incorporating an audio enhancement algorithm boosts the robustness and clinical utility of automatic respiratory sound classification systems, enhancing performance in noisy environments and fostering greater trust among medical professionals.

Title: Extended Road-Aware Line-of-Sight Probability Model for Urban Air Mobility
Authors: Abdullah Abu Zaid, Baha Eddine Youcef Belmekki, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: As urban air mobility (UAM) emerges as a transformative solution to urban transportation, the demand for robust communication frameworks capable of supporting high-density aerial traffic becomes increasingly critical. An essential area of communications improvement is reliably characterizing and minimizing interference on UAM aircraft from other aircraft and ground vehicles. To achieve this, accurate line-of-sight (LOS) models must be used. In this work, we highlight the limitations of a LOS probability model extensively used in the literature in accurately predicting interference caused by ground vehicles. Then, we introduce a modified probability of LOS model that improves interference prediction by incorporating the urban topography and the dynamic positioning of ground vehicles on streets. Our model's parameters are derived from extensive simulations and validated through real-world urban settings to ensure reliability and applicability.

Title: Addressing Emotion Bias in Music Emotion Recognition and Generation with Frechet Audio Distance
Authors: Yuanchao Li, Azalea Gui, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper
Abstract: The complex nature of musical emotion introduces inherent bias in both recognition and generation, particularly when relying on a single audio encoder, emotion classifier, or evaluation metric. In this work, we conduct a study on Music Emotion Recognition (MER) and Emotional Music Generation (EMG), employing diverse audio encoders alongside Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), a reference-free evaluation metric. Our study begins with a benchmark evaluation of MER, highlighting the limitations of using a single audio encoder and the disparities observed across different measurements. We then propose assessing MER performance using FAD derived from multiple encoders to provide a more objective measure of musical emotion. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced EMG approach designed to improve both the variability and prominence of generated musical emotion, thereby enhancing its realism. Additionally, we investigate the differences in realism between the emotions conveyed in real and synthetic music, comparing our EMG model against two baseline models. Experimental results underscore the issue of emotion bias in both MER and EMG and demonstrate the potential of using FAD and diverse audio encoders to evaluate musical emotion more objectively and effectively.

Title: Revise, Reason, and Recognize: LLM-Based Emotion Recognition via Emotion-Specific Prompts and ASR Error Correction
Authors: Yuanchao Li, Yuan Gong, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai
Abstract: Annotating and recognizing speech emotion using prompt engineering has recently emerged with the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy and reliability remain questionable. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on this topic, beginning with the proposal of novel prompts that incorporate emotion-specific knowledge from acoustics, linguistics, and psychology. Subsequently, we examine the effectiveness of LLM-based prompting on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription, contrasting it with ground-truth transcription. Furthermore, we propose a Revise-Reason-Recognize prompting pipeline for robust LLM-based emotion recognition from spoken language with ASR errors. Additionally, experiments on context-aware learning, in-context learning, and instruction tuning are performed to examine the usefulness of LLM training schemes in this direction. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to minor prompt variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the emotion-specific prompts, ASR error correction, and LLM training schemes for LLM-based emotion recognition. Our study aims to refine the use of LLMs in emotion recognition and related domains.

Title: Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition: Humans vs. Self-Supervised Models
Authors: Zhichen Han, Tianqi Geng, Hui Feng, Jiahong Yuan, Korin Richmond, Yuanchao Li
Abstract: Utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has proven effective, yet limited research has explored cross-lingual scenarios. This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.

Title: Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling
Authors: Yuanchao Li, Zixing Zhang, Jing Han, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai
Abstract: The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.

Title: Exploring Acoustic Similarity in Emotional Speech and Music via Self-Supervised Representations
Authors: Yujia Sun, Zeyu Zhao, Korin Richmond, Yuanchao Li
Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech and music shares similarities due to their acoustic overlap, which has led to interest in transferring knowledge between these domains. However, the shared acoustic cues between speech and music, particularly those encoded by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, remain largely unexplored, given the fact that SSL models for speech and music have rarely been applied in cross-domain research. In this work, we revisit the acoustic similarity between emotion speech and music, starting with an analysis of the layerwise behavior of SSL models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Furthermore, we perform cross-domain adaptation by comparing several approaches in a two-stage fine-tuning process, examining effective ways to utilize music for SER and speech for MER. Lastly, we explore the acoustic similarities between emotional speech and music using Frechet audio distance for individual emotions, uncovering the issue of emotion bias in both speech and music SSL models. Our findings reveal that while speech and music SSL models do capture shared acoustic features, their behaviors can vary depending on different emotions due to their training strategies and domain-specificities. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance SER and MER performance by leveraging knowledge from each other. This study provides new insights into the acoustic similarity between emotional speech and music, and highlights the potential for cross-domain generalization to improve SER and MER systems.

Title: Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motors: Optimal Magnet Placement and Drive System for Torque Density
Authors: Gholamreza Davarpanah, Sajjad Mohammadi, James L. Kirtley
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing new motors with high torque density, which is crucial for applications ranging from electric vehicles to robotics. We propose a double-teeth C-core switched reluctance motor with hybrid excitation, integrating permanent magnets and a novel drive technique to enhance motor torque density. We explore three magnet placement configurations to maximize torque. A common challenge with most self-starting methods used in two-phase SRMs is the generation of negative torque, which reduces the motor's torque density. Our adopted self-starting method minimizes negative torque, and we introduce a new drive strategy to control the switching on and off, effectively eliminating negative torque. Additionally, magnetic equivalent circuits are developed for the analytical design and theoretical analysis of all configurations. The SRMs under study are prototyped and tested, and their performances are evaluated in terms of torque-angle characteristics, current, and voltage. Both experimental and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the PM-assisted SRMs in enhancing torque density and efficiency.

Title: A New 8/14 Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motor with Improved Performance
Authors: Gholamreza Davarpanah, Hossein Shirzad, Jawad Faiz
Abstract: Despite their simple and robust structure, low cost, and simple cooling system, switched reluctance motors (SRMs) face the challenge of low mean torque. A possible solution is to change the structure of SRMs. This article introduces an innovative combination of the number of rotor teeth and stator teeth of a two-phase switch reluctance motor (TPSRM) with eight teeth for the stator and fourteen teeth for the rotor. As a result of its unique design, which has a short path for passing the main flux, it requires less magnetomotive force. This leads to less core and copper loss, resulting in increased efficiency. Each tooth of the stator in a phase develops a positive torque during the rotation of the rotor, which increases the torque and consequently increases the mean torque of the proposed TPSRM. A current hysteresis control (CHC) is simulated by 2D FEM for the proposed 8/14 TPSRM and the conventional 8/12 TPSRM under the same mechanical load on the shaft to get a current hysteresis reference of 15A at the nominal speed of 600 rpm. To verify the novelty and advantages of the suggested TPSRM, it is compared with the conventional 8/12 TPSRM in terms of mean and peak torque, torque density, and core and copper losses were compared. Lastly, the proposed 8/14 TPSRM is shown to have better performance than the conventional 8/12 TPSRM.

Title: CAD-Unet: A Capsule Network-Enhanced Unet Architecture for Accurate Segmentation of COVID-19 Lung Infections from CT Images
Authors: Yijie Dang, Weijun Ma, Xiaohu Luo, Huaizhu Wang
Abstract: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, medical imaging has emerged as a primary modality for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. In clinical settings, the segmentation of lung infections from computed tomography images enables rapid and accurate quantification and diagnosis of COVID-19. Segmentation of COVID-19 infections in the lungs poses a formidable challenge, primarily due to the indistinct boundaries and limited contrast presented by ground glass opacity manifestations. Moreover, the confounding similarity between infiltrates, lung tissues, and lung walls further complicates this segmentation task. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel deep network architecture, called CAD-Unet, for segmenting COVID-19 lung infections. In this architecture, capsule networks are incorporated into the existing Unet framework. Capsule networks represent a novel network architecture that differs from traditional convolutional neural networks. They utilize vectors for information transfer among capsules, facilitating the extraction of intricate lesion spatial information. Additionally, we design a capsule encoder path and establish a coupling path between the unet encoder and the capsule encoder. This design maximizes the complementary advantages of both network structures while achieving efficient information fusion. \noindent Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets, encompassing binary segmentation tasks and multi-class segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of the proposed model. The code has been released at: this https URL.

Title: FleSpeech: Flexibly Controllable Speech Generation with Various Prompts
Authors: Hanzhao Li, Yuke Li, Xinsheng Wang, Jingbin Hu, Qicong Xie, Shan Yang, Lei Xie
Abstract: Controllable speech generation methods typically rely on single or fixed prompts, hindering creativity and flexibility. These limitations make it difficult to meet specific user needs in certain scenarios, such as adjusting the style while preserving a selected speaker's timbre, or choosing a style and generating a voice that matches a character's visual appearance. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textit{FleSpeech}, a novel multi-stage speech generation framework that allows for more flexible manipulation of speech attributes by integrating various forms of control. FleSpeech employs a multimodal prompt encoder that processes and unifies different text, audio, and visual prompts into a cohesive representation. This approach enhances the adaptability of speech synthesis and supports creative and precise control over the generated speech. Additionally, we develop a data collection pipeline for multimodal datasets to facilitate further research and applications in this field. Comprehensive subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FleSpeech. Audio samples are available at this https URL

Title: ScaleFusionNet: Transformer-Guided Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Skin Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Saqib Qamar, Syed Furqan Qadri, Roobaea Alroobaea, Goram Mufarah M Alshmrani, Richard Jiang
Abstract: Melanoma is a malignant tumor originating from skin cell lesions. Accurate and efficient segmentation of skin lesions is essential for quantitative medical analysis but remains challenging. To address this, we propose ScaleFusionNet, a segmentation model that integrates Cross-Attention Transformer Module (CATM) and AdaptiveFusionBlock to enhance feature extraction and fusion. The model employs a hybrid architecture encoder that effectively captures both local and global features. We introduce CATM, which utilizes Swin Transformer Blocks and Cross Attention Fusion (CAF) to adaptively refine encoder-decoder feature fusion, reducing semantic gaps and improving segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the AdaptiveFusionBlock is improved by integrating adaptive multi-scale fusion, where Swin Transformer-based attention complements deformable convolution-based multi-scale feature extraction. This enhancement refines lesion boundaries and preserves fine-grained details. ScaleFusionNet achieves Dice scores of 92.94% and 91.65% on ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in skin lesion analysis. Our code implementation is publicly available at GitHub.

Title: Joint Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation and Compensation Based on the Farrow Structure
Authors: Deijany Rodriguez Linares, Oksana Moryakova, Håkan Johansson
Abstract: This paper introduces a sampling frequency offset (SFO) estimation method based on the Farrow structure, which is typically utilized for the SFO compensation and thereby enables a reduction of the implementation complexity of the SFO estimation. The proposed method is implemented in the time domain and works for arbitrary bandlimited signals, thus with no additional constraints on the waveform structure. Moreover, it can operate on only the real or imaginary part of a complex signal, which further reduces the estimation complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method can simultaneously estimate the SFO and additional sampling time offset (STO) and it is insensitive to other synchronization errors, like carrier frequency offset. Both the derivations of the proposed method and its implementation are presented, and through simulation examples, it is demonstrated that it can accurately estimate both SFO and STO for different types of bandlimited signals.

Title: Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Secure Wireless Communication
Authors: Liang Dai, Beixiong Zheng, Qingjie Wu, Changsheng You, Robert Schober, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that exploits new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) to improve wireless communication and sensing performance. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enabled secure communication system where confidential information is transmitted from an RA-based access point (AP) to a single-antenna legitimate user in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the AP. Accordingly, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution in an iterative manner, where the generalized Rayleigh quotient-based beamforming is applied and the RAs' deflection angles are optimized by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Our simulation results show that the proposed RA-enabled secure communication system achieves a significantly higher secrecy rate as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Title: Offset-free Nonlinear MPC with Koopman-based Surrogate Models
Authors: Irene Schimperna, Lea Bold, Karl Worthmann
Abstract: In this paper, we design offset-free nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for surrogate models based on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). The model used for prediction in MPC is augmented with a disturbance term, that is estimated by an observer. If the full information about the equilibrium of the real system is not available, a reference calculator is introduced in the algorithm to compute the MPC state and input references. The control algorithm guarantees offset-free tracking of the controlled output under the assumption that the modeling errors are asymptotically constant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is showcased with numerical simulations for two popular benchmark systems: the van-der-Pol oscillator and the four-tanks process.

Title: Markovian Continuity of the MMSE
Authors: Elad Domanovitz, Anatoly Khina
Abstract: Minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation is widely used in signal processing and related fields. While it is known to be non-continuous with respect to all standard notions of stochastic convergence, it remains robust in practical applications. In this work, we review the known counterexamples to the continuity of the MMSE. We observe that, in these counterexamples, the discontinuity arises from an element in the converging measurement sequence providing more information about the estimand than the limit of the measurement sequence. We argue that this behavior is uncharacteristic of real-world applications and introduce a new stochastic convergence notion, termed Markovian convergence, to address this issue. We prove that the MMSE is, in fact, continuous under this new notion. We supplement this result with semi-continuity and continuity guarantees of the MMSE in other settings and prove the continuity of the MMSE under linear estimation.

Title: No-Regret Model Predictive Control with Online Learning of Koopman Operators
Authors: Hongyu Zhou, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: We study a problem of simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. Particularly, we provide an algorithm for systems with unknown residual dynamics that can be expressed by Koopman operators. Such residual dynamics can model external disturbances and modeling errors, such as wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal non-causal controller. Specifically, the algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown dynamics will adapt to its states and actions. To this end, we assume the algorithm is given Koopman observable functions such that the unknown dynamics can be approximated by a linear dynamical system. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown residual dynamics. This model is updated online using least squares in a self-supervised manner based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in physics-based simulations of a cart-pole system aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters.

Title: Multi-Task Corrupted Prediction for Learning Robust Audio-Visual Speech Representation
Authors: Sungnyun Kim, Sungwoo Cho, Sangmin Bae, Kangwook Jang, Se-Young Yun
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

Title: SDWPF: A Dataset for Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting Challenge at KDD Cup 2022
Authors: Jingbo Zhou, Xinjiang Lu, Yixiong Xiao, Jiantao Su, Junfu Lyu, Yanjun Ma, Dejing Dou
Abstract: The variability of wind power supply can present substantial challenges to incorporating wind power into a grid system. Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions. The dataset is released at this https URL.

Title: Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem
Authors: Geoff Boeing
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14\%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.

Title: Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret
Authors: Hongyu Zhou, Vasileios Tzoumas
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.

Title: Let Network Decide What to Learn: Symbolic Music Understanding Model Based on Large-scale Adversarial Pre-training
Authors: Zijian Zhao
Abstract: As a crucial aspect of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), Symbolic Music Understanding (SMU) has garnered significant attention for its potential to assist both musicians and enthusiasts in learning and creating music. Recently, pre-trained language models have been widely adopted in SMU due to the substantial similarities between symbolic music and natural language, as well as the ability of these models to leverage limited music data effectively. However, some studies have shown the common pre-trained methods like Mask Language Model (MLM) may introduce bias issues like racism discrimination in Natural Language Process (NLP) and affects the performance of downstream tasks, which also happens in SMU. This bias often arises when masked tokens cannot be inferred from their context, forcing the model to overfit the training set instead of generalizing. To address this challenge, we propose Adversarial-MidiBERT for SMU, which adaptively determines what to mask during MLM via a masker network, rather than employing random masking. By avoiding the masking of tokens that are difficult to infer from context, our model is better equipped to capture contextual structures and relationships, rather than merely conforming to the training data distribution. We evaluate our method across four SMU tasks, and our approach demonstrates excellent performance in all cases. The code for our model is publicly available at this https URL .

Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.

Title: Underwater Image Enhancement via Dehazing and Color Restoration
Authors: Chengqin Wu, Shuai Yu, Tuyan Luo, Qiuhua Rao, Qingson Hu, Jingxiang Xu, Lijun Zhang
Abstract: Underwater visual imaging is crucial for marine engineering, but it suffers from low contrast, blurriness, and color degradation, which hinders downstream analysis. Existing underwater image enhancement methods often treat the haze and color cast as a unified degradation process, neglecting their inherent independence while overlooking their synergistic relationship. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based network (referred to as WaterFormer) to improve underwater image quality. WaterFormer contains three major components: a dehazing block (DehazeFormer Block) to capture the self-correlated haze features and extract deep-level features, a Color Restoration Block (CRB) to capture self-correlated color cast features, and a Channel Fusion Block (CFB) that dynamically integrates these decoupled features to achieve comprehensive enhancement. To ensure authenticity, a soft reconstruction layer based on the underwater imaging physics model is included. Further, a Chromatic Consistency Loss and Sobel Color Loss are designed to respectively preserve color fidelity and enhance structural details during network training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that WaterFormer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in enhancing underwater images.

Title: SmoothSegNet: A Global-Local Framework for Liver Tumor Segmentation with Clinical KnowledgeInformed Label Smoothing
Authors: Hairong Wang, Lingchao Mao, Zihan Zhang, Jing Li
Abstract: Liver cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and accurate Computed Tomography (CT)-based tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Manual delineation is time-intensive, prone to variability, and highlights the need for reliable automation. While deep learning has shown promise for automated liver segmentation, precise liver tumor segmentation remains challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors, imprecise tumor margins, and limited labeled data. We present SmoothSegNet, a novel deep learning framework that addresses these challenges with the three key designs: (1) A novel knowledge-informed label smoothing technique that distills knowledge from clinical data to generate smooth labels, which are used to regularize model training, reducing the overfitting risk and enhancing model performance; (2) A global and local segmentation framework that breaks down the main task into two simpler sub-tasks, allowing optimized preprocessing and training for each; and (3) Pre- and post-processing pipelines customized to the challenges of each subtask aimed to enhance tumor visibility and refines tumor boundaries. We apply the proposed model on a challenging HCC-TACE-Seg dataset and show that SmoothSegNet outperformed various benchmarks in segmentation performance, particularly at smaller tumors (<10cm). Our ablation studies show that the three design components complementarily contribute to the model improved performance. Code for the proposed method are available at this https URL.

Title: WARP-LCA: Efficient Convolutional Sparse Coding with Locally Competitive Algorithm
Authors: Geoffrey Kasenbacher, Felix Ehret, Gerrit Ecke, Sebastian Otte
Abstract: The locally competitive algorithm (LCA) can solve sparse coding problems across a wide range of use cases. Recently, convolution-based LCA approaches have been shown to be highly effective for enhancing robustness for image recognition tasks in vision pipelines. To additionally maximize representational sparsity, LCA with hard-thresholding can be applied. While this combination often yields very good solutions satisfying an $\ell_0$ sparsity criterion, it comes with significant drawbacks for practical application: (i) LCA is very inefficient, typically requiring hundreds of optimization cycles for convergence; (ii) the use of hard-thresholding results in a non-convex loss function, which might lead to suboptimal minima. To address these issues, we propose the Locally Competitive Algorithm with State Warm-up via Predictive Priming (WARP-LCA), which leverages a predictor network to provide a suitable initial guess of the LCA state based on the current input. Our approach significantly improves both convergence speed and the quality of solutions, while maintaining and even enhancing the overall strengths of LCA. We demonstrate that WARP-LCA converges faster by orders of magnitude and reaches better minima compared to conventional LCA. Moreover, the learned representations are more sparse and exhibit superior properties in terms of reconstruction and denoising quality as well as robustness when applied in deep recognition pipelines. Furthermore, we apply WARP-LCA to image denoising tasks, showcasing its robustness and practical effectiveness. Our findings confirm that the naive use of LCA with hard-thresholding results in suboptimal minima, whereas initializing LCA with a predictive guess results in better outcomes. This research advances the field of biologically inspired deep learning by providing a novel approach to convolutional sparse coding.

Title: High-Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Neural Representation for Video Compression
Authors: Li Yu, Zhihui Li, Jimin Xiao, Moncef Gabbouj
Abstract: Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) have simplified the video codec process and achieved swift decoding speeds by encoding video content into a neural network, presenting a promising solution for video compression. However, existing work overlooks the crucial issue that videos reconstructed by these methods lack high-frequency details. To address this problem, this paper introduces a High-Frequency Enhanced Hybrid Neural Representation Network. Our method focuses on leveraging high-frequency information to improve the synthesis of fine details by the network. Specifically, we design a wavelet high-frequency encoder that incorporates Wavelet Frequency Decomposer (WFD) blocks to generate high-frequency feature embeddings. Next, we design the High-Frequency Feature Modulation (HFM) block, which leverages the extracted high-frequency embeddings to enhance the fitting process of the decoder. Finally, with the refined Harmonic decoder block and a Dynamic Weighted Frequency Loss, we further reduce the potential loss of high-frequency information. Experiments on the Bunny and UVG datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods, showing notable improvements in detail preservation and compression performance.

Title: A Contrast-Agnostic Method for Ultra-High Resolution Claustrum Segmentation
Authors: Chiara Mauri, Ryan Fritz, Jocelyn Mora, Benjamin Billot, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, Koen Van Leemput, Jean Augustinack, Douglas N Greve
Abstract: The claustrum is a band-like gray matter structure located between putamen and insula whose exact functions are still actively researched. Its sheet-like structure makes it barely visible in in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans at typical resolutions and neuroimaging tools for its study, including methods for automatic segmentation, are currently very limited. In this paper, we propose a contrast- and resolution-agnostic method for claustrum segmentation at ultra-high resolution (0.35 mm isotropic); the method is based on the SynthSeg segmentation framework (Billot et al., 2023), which leverages the use of synthetic training intensity images to achieve excellent generalization. In particular, SynthSeg requires only label maps to be trained, since corresponding intensity images are synthesized on the fly with random contrast and resolution. We trained a deep learning network for automatic claustrum segmentation, using claustrum manual labels obtained from 18 ultra-high resolution MRI scans (mostly ex vivo). We demonstrated the method to work on these 18 high resolution cases (Dice score = 0.632, mean surface distance = 0.458 mm, and volumetric similarity = 0.867 using 6-fold Cross Validation (CV)), and also on in vivo T1-weighted MRI scans at typical resolutions (~1 mm isotropic). We also demonstrated that the method is robust in a test-retest setting and when applied to multimodal imaging (T2-weighted, Proton Density and quantitative T1 scans). To the best of our knowledge this is the first accurate method for automatic ultra-high resolution claustrum segmentation, which is robust against changes in contrast and resolution. The method is released at this https URL and as part of the neuroimaging package Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012).

Title: Ditto: Motion-Space Diffusion for Controllable Realtime Talking Head Synthesis
Authors: Tianqi Li, Ruobing Zheng, Minghui Yang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have endowed talking head synthesis with subtle expressions and vivid head movements, but have also led to slow inference speed and insufficient control over generated results. To address these issues, we propose Ditto, a diffusion-based talking head framework that enables fine-grained controls and real-time inference. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf motion extractor and devise a diffusion transformer to generate representations in a specific motion space. We optimize the model architecture and training strategy to address the issues in generating motion representations, including insufficient disentanglement between motion and identity, and large internal discrepancies within the representation. Besides, we employ diverse conditional signals while establishing a mapping between motion representation and facial semantics, enabling control over the generation process and correction of the results. Moreover, we jointly optimize the holistic framework to enable streaming processing, real-time inference, and low first-frame delay, offering functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and exhibits superiority in both controllability and real-time performance.

Title: Testing CPS with Design Assumptions-Based Metamorphic Relations and Genetic Programming
Authors: Claudio Mandrioli, Seung Yeob Shin, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) software is used to enforce desired behaviours on physical systems. To test the interaction between the CPS software and the system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems, researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore, we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.

Title: Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties
Authors: Aditya Deole, Mehran Mesbahi
Abstract: In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.

Title: Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports

Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.

Title: Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning
Authors: Yu Mei, Xinyu Zhou, Shuyang Yu, Vaibhav Srivastava, Xiaobo Tan
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.

Title: Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases
Authors: Srikar Annamraju, Harris Nisar, Dayu Xia, Shankar A. Deka, Anne Horowitz, Nadica Miljković, Dušan M. Stipanović
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.

Title: End-to-end Audio Deepfake Detection from RAW Waveforms: a RawNet-Based Approach with Cross-Dataset Evaluation

Abstract: Audio deepfakes represent a growing threat to digital security and trust, leveraging advanced generative models to produce synthetic speech that closely mimics real human voices. Detecting such manipulations is especially challenging under open-world conditions, where spoofing methods encountered during testing may differ from those seen during training. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for audio deepfake detection that operates directly on raw waveforms. Our model, RawNetLite, is a lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture designed to capture both spectral and temporal features without handcrafted preprocessing. To enhance robustness, we introduce a training strategy that combines data from multiple domains and adopts Focal Loss to emphasize difficult or ambiguous samples. We further demonstrate that incorporating codec-based manipulations and applying waveform-level audio augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, noise, and time stretching) leads to significant generalization improvements under realistic acoustic conditions. The proposed model achieves over 99.7% F1 and 0.25% EER on in-domain data (FakeOrReal), and up to 83.4% F1 with 16.4% EER on a challenging out-of-distribution test set (AVSpoof2021 + CodecFake). These findings highlight the importance of diverse training data, tailored objective functions and audio augmentations in building resilient and generalizable audio forgery detectors.
