Title: From Dialect Gaps to Identity Maps: Tackling Variability in Speaker Verification
Authors: Abdulhady Abas Abdullah, Soran Badawi, Dana A. Abdullah, Dana Rasul Hamad, Hanan Abdulrahman Taher, Sabat Salih Muhamad, Aram Mahmood Ahmed, Bryar A. Hassan, Sirwan Abdolwahed Aula, Tarik A. Rashid
Abstract: The complexity and difficulties of Kurdish speaker detection among its several dialects are investigated in this work. Because of its great phonetic and lexical differences, Kurdish with several dialects including Kurmanji, Sorani, and Hawrami offers special challenges for speaker recognition systems. The main difficulties in building a strong speaker identification system capable of precisely identifying speakers across several dialects are investigated in this work. To raise the accuracy and dependability of these systems, it also suggests solutions like sophisticated machine learning approaches, data augmentation tactics, and the building of thorough dialect-specific corpus. The results show that customized strategies for every dialect together with cross-dialect training greatly enhance recognition performance.

Title: Rethinking Boundary Detection in Deep Learning-Based Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yi Lin, Dong Zhang, Xiao Fang, Yufan Chen, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Hao Chen
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal task within the realms of medical image analysis and computer vision. While current methods have shown promise in accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that CTO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on these datasets while maintaining competitive model complexity.

Title: EvEnhancer: Empowering Effectiveness, Efficiency and Generalizability for Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with Events
Authors: Shuoyan Wei, Feng Li, Shengeng Tang, Yao Zhao, Huihui Bai
Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) endeavors to upscale videos simultaneously at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, which has recently garnered increasing interest. However, prevailing methods struggle to yield satisfactory videos at out-of-distribution spatial and temporal scales. On the other hand, event streams characterized by high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, exhibit compelling promise in vision tasks. This paper presents EvEnhancer, an innovative approach that marries the unique advantages of event streams to elevate effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability for C-STVSR. Our approach hinges on two pivotal components: 1) Event-adapted synthesis capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and events to discern and learn long-term motion trajectories, enabling the adaptive interpolation and fusion of informative spatiotemporal features; 2) Local implicit video transformer integrates local implicit video neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous video representations utilized to generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions and frame rates. Experiments show that EvEnhancer achieves superiority on synthetic and real-world datasets and preferable generalizability on out-of-distribution scales against state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Cross-organ all-in-one parallel compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging
Authors: Baoshun Shi, Zheng Liu, Xin Meng, Yan Yang
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based parallel compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (p-CSMRI) have significantly improved reconstruction quality. However, current p-CSMRI methods often require training separate deep neural network (DNN) for each organ due to anatomical variations, creating a barrier to developing generalized medical image reconstruction systems. To address this, we propose CAPNet (cross-organ all-in-one deep unfolding p-CSMRI network), a unified framework that implements a p-CSMRI iterative algorithm via three specialized modules: auxiliary variable module, prior module, and data consistency module. Recognizing that p-CSMRI systems often employ varying sampling ratios for different organs, resulting in organ-specific artifact patterns, we introduce an artifact generation submodule, which extracts and integrates artifact features into the data consistency module to enhance the discriminative capability of the overall network. For the prior module, we design an organ structure-prompt generation submodule that leverages structural features extracted from the segment anything model (SAM) to create cross-organ prompts. These prompts are strategically incorporated into the prior module through an organ structure-aware Mamba submodule. Comprehensive evaluations on a cross-organ dataset confirm that CAPNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across multiple anatomical structures using a single unified model. Our code will be published at this https URL.

Title: Advancing 3D Medical Image Segmentation: Unleashing the Potential of Planarian Neural Networks in Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Ziyuan Huang, Kevin Huggins, Srikar Bellur
Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of 3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image segmentation.

Title: Geometric Fault-Tolerant Neural Network Tracking Control of Unknown Systems on Matrix Lie Groups
Authors: Robin Chhabra, Farzaneh Abdollahi
Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

Title: Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Tao Hong, Zhaoyi Xu, Se Young Chun, Luis Hernandez-Garcia, Jeffrey A. Fessler
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Title: Joint User Association and Bandwidth Assignment for Digital Twin-Assisted Multi-RAT Networks
Authors: Manobendu Sarker, Md. Zoheb Hassan, Georges Kaddoum
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate user equipment (UE)-radio access technology (RAT) association and bandwidth assignment to maximize sum-rates in a multi-RAT network. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly addresses UE association and bandwidth allocation, adhering to practical constraints. Because of the NP-hard nature of this problem, finding a globally optimal solution is computationally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a centralized and computationally efficient heuristic algorithm that aims to maximize sum-rates while enhancing quality of service (QoS). Yet, the proposed approach requires global channel state information (CSI) for near-optimal performance, which incurs substantial overhead and data collection costs in large-scale multi-RAT networks. To alleviate this burden, we use a digital twin (DT) of the multi-RAT network, leveraging its context-awareness to acquire global CSI with reduced overhead. Our numerical results reveal that our approach improves sum-rates by up to 43% over baseline method, with less than a 5% deviation from the theoretical optimal solution, while achieving up to a 43% improvement in QoS. Further analysis reveals that our method not only surpasses the optimal solution in terms of QoS enhancement, but also ensures significant computational efficiency.

Title: Integrated Image Reconstruction and Target Recognition based on Deep Learning Technique
Authors: Cien Zhang, Jiaming Zhang, Jiajun He, Okan Yurduseven
Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches. Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

Title: Comparative Study of Generative Models for Early Detection of Failures in Medical Devices
Authors: Binesh Sadanandan, Bahareh Arghavani Nobar, Vahid Behzadan
Abstract: The medical device industry has significantly advanced by integrating sophisticated electronics like microchips and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to enhance the safety and usability of life-saving devices. These complex electro-mechanical systems, however, introduce challenging failure modes that are not easily detectable with conventional methods. Effective fault detection and mitigation become vital as reliance on such electronics grows. This paper explores three generative machine learning-based approaches for fault detection in medical devices, leveraging sensor data from surgical staplers,a class 2 medical device. Historically considered low-risk, these devices have recently been linked to an increasing number of injuries and fatalities. The study evaluates the performance and data requirements of these machine-learning approaches, highlighting their potential to enhance device safety.

Title: Learning Economic Model Predictive Control via Clustering and Kernel-Based Lipschitz Regression
Authors: Weiliang Xiong, Defeng He, Haiping Du
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning economic model predictive control scheme for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to input and state constraints and unknown dynamics. We design a fast and accurate Lipschitz regression method using input and output data that combines clustering and kernel regression to learn the unknown dynamics. In each cluster, the parallel convex optimization problems are solved to estimate the kernel weights and reduce the Lipschitz constant of the predictor, hence limiting the error propagation in the prediction horizon. We derive the two different bounds of learning errors in deterministic and probabilistic forms and customize a new robust constraint-tightening strategy for the discontinuous predictor. Then, the learning economic model predictive control algorithm is formulated by introducing a stabilized optimization problem to construct a Lyapunov function. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations of a numerical example and a continuously stirred tank reactor.

Title: Advanced 3D Imaging Approach to TSV/TGV Metrology and Inspection Using Only Optical Microscopy
Authors: Gugeong Sung
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to silicon and glass via inspection, which combines hybrid field microscopy with photometric stereo. Conventional optical microscopy techniques are generally limited to superficial inspections and struggle to effectively visualize the internal structures of silicon and glass vias. By utilizing various lighting conditions for 3D reconstruction, the proposed method surpasses these limitations. By integrating photometric stereo to the traditional optical microscopy, the proposed method not only enhances the capability to detect micro-scale defects but also provides a detailed visualization of depth and edge abnormality, which are typically not visible with conventional optical microscopy inspection. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method effectively captures intricate surface details and internal structures. Quantitative comparisons between the reconstructed models and actual measurements present the capability of the proposed method to significantly improve silicon and glass via inspection process. As a result, the proposed method achieves enhanced cost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy and repeatability, suggesting substantial advancements in silicon and glass via inspection techniques

Title: MoRe-3DGSMR: Motion-resolved reconstruction framework for free-breathing pulmonary MRI based on 3D Gaussian representation
Authors: Tengya Peng, Ruyi Zha, Qing Zou
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised, motion-resolved reconstruction framework for high-resolution, free-breathing pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing a three-dimensional Gaussian representation (3DGS). The proposed method leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic pulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for continuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed using a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion signals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the estimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory phases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image volume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector fields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through spatial transformation of the reference volume. The proposed reconstruction pipeline is evaluated on six datasets from six subjects and bench-marked against three state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction framework effectively reconstructs high-resolution, motion-resolved pulmonary MR images. Compared with existing approaches, it achieves superior image quality, reflected by higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proposed unsupervised 3DGS-based reconstruction method enables accurate motion-resolved pulmonary MRI with isotropic spatial resolution. Its superior performance in image quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods highlights its potential as a robust solution for clinical pulmonary MR imaging.

Title: Over-the-Air ODE-Inspired Neural Network for Dual Task-Oriented Semantic Communications
Authors: Mengbing Liu, Jiancheng An, Chongwen Huang, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Analog machine-learning hardware platforms promise greater speed and energy efficiency than their digital counterparts. Specifically, over-the-air analog computation allows offloading computation to the wireless propagation through carefully constructed transmitted signals. In addition, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is emerging as a promising solution for next-generation wireless networks, offering the ability to tailor the communication environment. Leveraging the advantages of RIS, we design and implement the ordinary differential equation (ODE) neural network using over-the-air computation (AirComp) and demonstrate its effectiveness for dual tasks. We engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment through distributed RISs to create an architecture termed the over-the-air ordinary differential equation (Air-ODE) network. Unlike the conventional digital ODE-inspired neural network, the Air-ODE block utilizes the physics of wave reflection and the reconfigurable phase shifts of RISs to implement an ODE block in the analog domain, enhancing spectrum efficiency. Moreover, the advantages of Air-ODE are demonstrated in a deep learning-based semantic communication (DeepSC) system by extracting effective semantic information to reduce the data transmission load, while achieving the dual functions of image reconstruction and semantic tagging simultaneously at the receiver. Simulation results show that the analog Air-ODE network can achieve similar performance to the digital ODE-inspired network. Specifically, for the image reconstruction and semantic tagging task, compared with the analog network without the Air-ODE block, the Air-ODE block can achieve around 2 times gain in both reconstruction quality and tagging accuracy.

Title: Experiment Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave Bistatic ISAC Systems
Authors: Chenhao Luo, Chongrui Wang, Aimin Tang, Fei Gao, Chaojun Xu
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to monostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of self-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network infrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the sensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state information (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains different types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO), carrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely degrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this problem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for mmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be blocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems, the reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is first identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same system errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is utilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC system is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and delay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.

Authors: Daniele Gerosa, Rui Hou, Vimar Björk, Ulf Gustavsson, Thomas Eriksson
Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and compensation of stochastic discrete time clock jitter in Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Two novel, computationally efficient de-jittering sample pilots-based algorithms for baseband signals are proposed: one consisting in solving a sequence of weighted least-squares problems and another that fully leverages the correlated jitter structure in a Kalman filter-type routine. Alongside, a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical analysis of the linearization errors committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic simulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and stress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.

Title: Enhanced Robust Tracking Control: An Online Learning Approach
Authors: Ao Jin, Weijian Zhao, Yifeng Ma, Panfeng Huang, Fan Zhang
Abstract: This work focuses the tracking control problem for nonlinear systems subjected to unknown external disturbances. Inspired by contraction theory, a neural network-dirven CCM synthesis is adopted to obtain a feedback controller that could track any feasible trajectory. Based on the observation that the system states under continuous control input inherently contain embedded information about unknown external disturbances, we propose an online learning scheme that captures the disturbances dyanmics from online historical data and embeds the compensation within the CCM controller. The proposed scheme operates as a plug-and-play module that intrinsically enhances the tracking performance of CCM synthesis. The numerical simulations on tethered space robot and PVTOL demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed scheme. The source code of the proposed online learning scheme can be found at this https URL.

Title: ADNP-15: An Open-Source Histopathological Dataset for Neuritic Plaque Segmentation in Human Brain Whole Slide Images with Frequency Domain Image Enhancement for Stain Normalization
Authors: Chenxi Zhao, Jianqiang Li, Qing Zhao, Jing Bai, Susana Boluda, Benoit Delatour, Lev Stimmer, Daniel Racoceanu, Gabriel Jimenez, Guanghui Fu
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, which serve as key histopathological features. The identification and segmentation of these lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the field.

Title: Statistical CSI Acquisition for Multi-frequency Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Jinke Tang, Li You, Xinrui Gong, Chenjie Xie, Xiqi Gao, Xiang-Gen Xia, Xueyuan Shi
Abstract: Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a promising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable transmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical channel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency massive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission performance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for obtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we introduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping relationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power spectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation across different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR) method to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on that of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across different frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the maximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for high-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the high-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by applying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency bands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach significantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while effectively reducing system overhead.

Title: Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy Measurements without Reconstruction
Authors: Navya Sonal Agarwal, Jan Philipp Schneider, Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota, Syed Muhammad Kazim, John Meshreki, Ivo Ihrke, Michael Moeller
Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.

Title: RepSNet: A Nucleus Instance Segmentation model based on Boundary Regression and Structural Re-parameterization
Authors: Shengchun Xiong, Xiangru Li, Yunpeng Zhong, Wanfen Peng
Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, and nucleus instance segmentation is a key step in digital pathology analysis and pathological diagnosis. However, the computational efficiency of the model and the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&E-stained histopathological images. First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore, different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to several typical benchmark models.

Title: Predictive Control of EV Overnight Charging with Multi-Session Flexibility
Authors: Felix Wieberneit, Emanuele Crisostomi, Anthony Quinn, Robert Shorten
Abstract: The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight, where the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus representing a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control algorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require full charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of surplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of controlled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug, scheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over prediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising model predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK National Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions with multi-session planning of 40 to 46\% compared to uncontrolled charging and 19 to 26\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the driving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility and consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid carbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant variations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.

Title: Duplex Self-Aligning Resonant Beam Communications and Power Transfer with Coupled Spatially Distributed Laser Resonator
Authors: Mingliang Xiong, Qingwen Liu, Hao Deng, Gang Wang, Gang Li, Bin He
Abstract: Sustainable energy supply and high-speed communications are two significant needs for mobile electronic devices. This paper introduces a self-aligning resonant beam system for simultaneous light information and power transfer (SLIPT), employing a novel coupled spatially distributed resonator (CSDR). The system utilizes a resonant beam for efficient power delivery and a second-harmonic beam for concurrent data transmission, inherently minimizing echo interference and enabling bidirectional communication. Through comprehensive analyses, we investigate the CSDR's stable region, beam evolution, and power characteristics in relation to working distance and device parameters. Numerical simulations validate the CSDR-SLIPT system's feasibility by identifying a stable beam waist location for achieving accurate mode-match coupling between two spatially distributed resonant cavities and demonstrating its operational range and efficient power delivery across varying distances. The research reveals the system's benefits in terms of both safety and energy transmission efficiency. We also demonstrate the trade-off among the reflectivities of the cavity mirrors in the CSDR. These findings offer valuable design insights for resonant beam systems, advancing SLIPT with significant potential for remote device connectivity.

Title: MDAA-Diff: CT-Guided Multi-Dose Adaptive Attention Diffusion Model for PET Denoising
Authors: Xiaolong Niu, Zanting Ye, Xu Han, Yanchao Huang, Hao Sun, Hubing Wu, Lijun Lu
Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks. Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is publicly available.

Title: Listen to Extract: Onset-Prompted Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Pengjie Shen, Kangrui Chen, Shulin He, Pengru Chen, Shuqi Yuan, He Kong, Xueliang Zhang, Zhong-Qiu Wang
Abstract: We propose $\textit{listen to extract}$ (LExt), a highly-effective while extremely-simple algorithm for monaural target speaker extraction (TSE). Given an enrollment utterance of a target speaker, LExt aims at extracting the target speaker from the speaker's mixed speech with other speakers. For each mixture, LExt concatenates an enrollment utterance of the target speaker to the mixture signal at the waveform level, and trains deep neural networks (DNN) to extract the target speech based on the concatenated mixture signal. The rationale is that, this way, an artificial speech onset is created for the target speaker and it could prompt the DNN (a) which speaker is the target to extract; and (b) spectral-temporal patterns of the target speaker that could help extraction. This simple approach produces strong TSE performance on multiple public TSE datasets including WSJ0-2mix, WHAM! and WHAMR!.

Title: Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price Balancing Scheme
Authors: Max Bruninx, Timothy Verstraeten, Jalal Kazempour, Jan Helsen
Abstract: We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.

Title: Regression-based Melody Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification
Authors: Kavya Ranjan Saxena, Vipul Arora
Abstract: Existing machine learning models approach the task of melody estimation from polyphonic audio as a classification problem by discretizing the pitch values, which results in the loss of finer frequency variations present in the melody. To better capture these variations, we propose to approach this task as a regression problem. Apart from predicting only the pitch for a particular region in the audio, we also predict its uncertainty to enhance the trustworthiness of the model. To perform regression-based melody estimation, we propose three different methods that use histogram representation to model the pitch values. Such a representation requires the support range of the histogram to be continuous. The first two methods address the abrupt discontinuity between unvoiced and voiced frequency ranges by mapping them to a continuous range. The third method reformulates melody estimation as a fully Bayesian task, modeling voicing detection as a classification problem, and voiced pitch estimation as a regression problem. Additionally, we introduce a novel method to estimate the uncertainty from the histogram representation that correlates well with the deviation of the mean of the predicted distribution from the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that reformulating melody estimation as a regression problem significantly improves the performance over classification-based approaches. Comparing the proposed methods with a state-of-the-art regression model, it is observed that the Bayesian method performs the best at estimating both the melody and its associated uncertainty.

Authors: Linhan Ma, Dake Guo, He Wang, Jin Xu, Lei Xie
Abstract: Current speech generation research can be categorized into two primary classes: non-autoregressive and autoregressive. The fundamental distinction between these approaches lies in the duration prediction strategy employed for predictable-length sequences. The NAR methods ensure stability in speech generation by explicitly and independently modeling the duration of each phonetic unit. Conversely, AR methods employ an autoregressive paradigm to predict the compressed speech token by implicitly modeling duration with Markov properties. Although this approach improves prosody, it does not provide the structural guarantees necessary for stability. To simultaneously address the issues of stability and naturalness in speech generation, we propose FlexSpeech, a stable, controllable, and expressive TTS model. The motivation behind FlexSpeech is to incorporate Markov dependencies and preference optimization directly on the duration predictor to boost its naturalness while maintaining explicit modeling of the phonetic units to ensure stability. Specifically, we decompose the speech generation task into two components: an AR duration predictor and a NAR acoustic model. The acoustic model is trained on a substantial amount of data to learn to render audio more stably, given reference audio prosody and phone durations. The duration predictor is optimized in a lightweight manner for different stylistic variations, thereby enabling rapid style transfer while maintaining a decoupled relationship with the specified speaker timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA stability and naturalness in zero-shot TTS. More importantly, when transferring to a specific stylistic domain, we can accomplish lightweight optimization of the duration module solely with about 100 data samples, without the need to adjust the acoustic model, thereby enabling rapid and stable style transfer.

Title: Temperature-Resilient LC-RIS Phase-Shift Design for Multi-user Downlink Communications
Authors: Nairy Moghadas Gholian, Mohamadreza Delbari, Vahid Jamali, Arash Asadi
Abstract: The reflecting antenna elements in most reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) use semiconductor-based (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes and varactors) phase shifters. Although effective, a drawback of this technology is the high power consumption and cost, which become particularly prohibitive in millimeter-wave (mmWave)/sub-Terahertz range. With the advances in Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend in using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs. LC-RISs are expected to significantly reduce the fabrication costs and power consumption. However, the nematic LC molecules are sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore, implementing LC-RIS in geographical regions with varying temperatures requires temperature-resilient designs. The mentioned temperature variation issue becomes more significant at higher temperatures as the phase shifter range reduces in warmer conditions, whereas it expands in cooler ones. In this paper, we study the impact of temperature on the operation of LC-RISs and develop a temperature-resilient phase shift design. Specifically, we formulate a max-min signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio optimization for a multi-user downlink mmWave network that accounts for the impact of temperature in the LC-RIS phase shifts. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement for the considered set of parameters when using our algorithm compared to the baseline approach, which neglects the temperature effects.

Title: LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations
Authors: Wangkun Xu, Zhongda Chu, Fei Teng
Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

Title: Improved Brain Tumor Detection in MRI: Fuzzy Sigmoid Convolution in Deep Learning
Authors: Muhammad Irfan, Anum Nawaz, Riku Klen, Abdulhamit Subasi, Tomi Westerlund, Wei Chen
Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential to improving patient outcomes. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection has shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization, which limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution (FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the receptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient feature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In the FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based architecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89% on three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than large-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational efficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early. This research offers lightweight, high-performance deep-learning models for medical imaging applications.

Title: Normalize Everything: A Preconditioned Magnitude-Preserving Architecture for Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Julius Richter, Danilo de Oliveira, Timo Gerkmann
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for diffusion-based speech enhancement. Our method employs a Schroedinger bridge to transform the noisy speech distribution into the clean speech distribution. To stabilize and improve training, we employ time-dependent scalings of the inputs and outputs of the network, known as preconditioning. We consider two skip connection configurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the denoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different speech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance during training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that normalizes all activations and network weights to unit length. Additionally, we propose learning the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for effective input conditioning. After training, we apply a method to approximate different exponential moving average (EMA) profiles and investigate their effects on the speech enhancement performance. In contrast to image generation tasks, where longer EMA lengths often enhance mode coverage, we observe that shorter EMA lengths consistently lead to better performance on standard speech enhancement metrics. Code, audio examples, and checkpoints are available online.

Title: Adaptive Biased User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Wireless Federate Learning Network
Authors: Changxiang Wu, Yijing Ren, Daniel K. C. So, Jie Tang
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized collaborative model training in distributed networks, prioritizing data privacy and communication efficiency. This paper investigates efficient deployment of FL in wireless heterogeneous networks, focusing on strategies to accelerate convergence despite stragglers. The primary objective is to minimize long-term convergence wall-clock time through optimized user scheduling and resource allocation. While stragglers may introduce delays in a single round, their inclusion can expedite subsequent rounds, particularly when they possess critical information. Moreover, balancing single-round duration with the number of cumulative rounds, compounded by dynamic training and transmission conditions, necessitates a novel approach beyond conventional optimization solutions. To tackle these challenges, convergence analysis with respect to adaptive and biased scheduling is derived. Then, by factoring in real-time system and statistical information, including diverse energy constraints and users' energy harvesting capabilities, a deep reinforcement learning approach, empowered by proximal policy optimization, is employed to adaptively select user sets. For the scheduled users, Lagrangian decomposition is applied to optimize local resource utilization, further enhancing system efficiency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for various FL tasks, demonstrating reduced task time compared to existing benchmarks under various settings.

Title: White Light Specular Reflection Data Augmentation for Deep Learning Polyp Detection
Authors: Jose Angel Nuñez, Fabian Vazquez, Diego Adame, Xiaoyan Fu, Pengfei Gu, Bin Fu
Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for the patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution. However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false this http URL address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in polyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new data augmentation method.

Title: High Altitude Platform-Based Caching and Multicasting for Rural Connectivity
Authors: Yongqiang Zhang, Mustafa A. Kishk, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: Providing efficient and reliable content delivery in rural areas remains a significant challenge due to the lack of communication infrastructure. To bridge the digital divide, this paper investigates the potential of leveraging multiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) for energy-efficient content delivery in wide rural regions. Each caching-enabled HAP is equipped with both Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers for backhaul links and Radio Frequency (RF) antenna arrays for access links. To further enhance network efficiency, we consider a network coding-based multicasting scheme, where different types of content are treated as distinct multicast sessions. With the objective of minimizing long-term power cost, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates deep reinforcement learn-ing (DRL) and convex optimization to jointly optimize dynamic caching strategies and resource allocation across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces power cost compared to several baseline approaches, providing a practical solution for improving rural connectivity.

Title: CV-MP: Max-Pressure Control in Heterogeneously Distributed and Partially Connected Vehicle Environments
Authors: Chaopeng Tan, Dingshan Sun, Hao Liu, Marco Rinaldi, Hans van Lint
Abstract: Max-pressure (MP) control has emerged as a prominent real-time network traffic signal control strategy due to its simplicity, decentralized structure, and theoretical guarantees of network queue stability. Meanwhile, advances in connected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based traffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have investigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV environments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research gaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time CV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both the spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing approaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability that are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we pioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only partially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary condition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results on an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays compared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV penetration rates. Moreover, in scenarios with dynamic traffic demand, CV-MP achieves lower spillover peaks even with low and heterogeneous CV penetration rates, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Title: Benchmarking Ophthalmology Foundation Models for Clinically Significant Age Macular Degeneration Detection
Authors: Benjamin A. Cohen, Jonathan Fhima, Meishar Meisel, Baskin Meital, Luis Filipe Nakayama, Eran Berkowitz, Joachim A. Behar
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Title: Optimal Microgrid Sizing of Offshore Renewable Energy Sources for Offshore Platforms and Coastal Communities
Authors: Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li, Kaushik Rajashekara
Abstract: The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards renewable energy and advanced storage solutions, driven by the urgent need for sustainable and resilient power systems. Isolated offshore communities, such as islands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or diesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy integration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines, wave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired with a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper introduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to identify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for offshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting for battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a deep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in variables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge, depth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions demonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while maintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design solution for offshore microgrid systems.

Title: Augmented Deep Contexts for Spatially Embedded Video Coding
Authors: Yifan Bian, Chuanbo Tang, Li Li, Dong Liu
Abstract: Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts. Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution bitstream. Our code and model are available at this https URL.

Title: Localization and path following for an autonomous e-scooter
Authors: David Meister, Robin Strässer, Felix Brändle, Marc Seidel, Benno Bassler, Nathan Gerber, Jan Kautz, Elena Rommel, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In order to mitigate economical, ecological, and societal challenges in electric scooter (e-scooter) sharing systems, we develop an autonomous e-scooter prototype. Our vision is to design a fully autonomous prototype that can find its way to the next parking spot, high-demand area, or charging station. In this work, we propose a path following solution to enable localization and navigation in an urban environment with a provided path to follow. We design a closed-loop architecture that solves the localization and path following problem while allowing the e-scooter to maintain its balance with a previously developed reaction wheel mechanism. Our approach facilitates state and input constraints, e.g., adhering to the path width, while remaining executable on a Raspberry Pi 5. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a real-world experiment on our prototype.

Title: Approximation-free Control for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications using Spatiotemporal Tubes
Authors: Ratnangshu Das, Subhodeep Choudhury, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: This paper presents a spatiotemporal tube (STT)-based control framework for satisfying Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in unknown control-affine systems. We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with formal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that operates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system trajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, trajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.

Title: From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis
Authors: Niklas Grieger, Siamak Mehrkanoon, Philipp Ritter, Stephan Bialonski
Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

Title: OcularAge: A Comparative Study of Iris and Periocular Images for Pediatric Age Estimation
Authors: Naveenkumar G Venkataswamy, Poorna Ravi, Stephanie Schuckers, Masudul H. Imtiaz
Abstract: Estimating a child's age from ocular biometric images is challenging due to subtle physiological changes and the limited availability of longitudinal datasets. Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288 pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10 milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their suitability for real-time applications.

Title: Chirp-Based Aliasing Analysis of Arrays in the Spherical Wavefront Regime
Authors: Gilles Monnoyer, Laurence Defraigne, Baptiste Sambon, Jérôme Louveaux, Luc Vandendorpe
Abstract: In antenna arrays, wave propagation modeling based on Euclidean principles is typically represented by steering vectors or signals. This paper provides a new, chirp-based, interpretation of steering vectors in the Spherical Wavefront Regime (SWR), establishing a relationship between the spatial spectrum of the received (resp. transmitted) signal and the geometry of the array and the source (resp. target). Leveraging the well-known sampling theorem, we analyze aliasing effects arising from spatial sampling with a finite number of antennas and understand how these effects degrade the Ambiguity Function (AF). Our framework provides geometric insight into these degradations, offering a deeper understanding of the non-space-invariant aliasing mechanisms in the SWR. The proposed approach is formulated for general antenna arrays and then instantiated to Circular Array and to Uniform Linear Array structures operating in Near Field conditions.

Title: Rodent Breathing Waveforms in ApoE Rats: Statistical and Entropic Differentiation
Authors: Stephen E. Wormald, Nicholas J. Napoli, Gordon S. Mitchell, Alexandria B. Marciante
Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variations are involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport, with the ApoE4 allele being a known risk factor associated with neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Emerging evidence suggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and vitality. However, the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing patterns remains largely unexplored. This work investigates differences in breathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from plethysmography (PLETH) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE genotypes (referred to herein as gene59 and gene95). Findings reveal significant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and approximate entropy between the two genotypes, observed during both active and resting states. Additionally, the study examines the transient impact of sighs (deep breaths) on these breathing metrics, demonstrating that entropy and other measures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh.

Title: On the Multiangle Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform
Authors: Christian Oswald, Franz Pernkopf
Abstract: The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier transform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency analysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional Fourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT has lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous possible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present a simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its standard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT). Furthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT to halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way for applications in resource constrained environments.

Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore options for data standardisation in audiology and document the global audiology community's current knowledge and views of data standards, explore their needs and preferences, and develop recommendations for data standardisation as a result. Design: A mixed-methods approach, combining a structured survey with an in-depth exploration of themes by experts during a special session on "Big Data and Data Standards in Audiology" at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology. Study Sample: The survey sample consisted of 82 members of the global audiology community; five experts joined the panel discussion. Results: Survey results emphasized the need for data standardisation in audiology aimed at facilitating research and improving patient care. Knowledge of existing initiatives was low: 38% were aware of initiatives. Yet, 90% envisioned contributing to them moving forward. The panel discussion explored emerging standardisation initiatives in audiology (OMOP, openEHR, HIMSA's Noah standard), challenges (e.g., data quality and privacy), and opportunities (e.g., conversion between approaches and synergies with other medical fields). Conclusions: The community support identified in this study could be leveraged to further develop standardisation initiatives for audiology, ensuring alignment between initiatives and with other medical fields.

Title: Hybrid-Field 6D Movable Antenna for Terahertz Communications: Channel Modeling and Estimation
Authors: Xiaodan Shao, Yixiao Zhang, Shisheng Hu, Zhixuan Tang, Mingcheng He, Xinyu Huang, Weihua Zhuang, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: In this work, we study a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enhanced Terahertz (THz) network that supports a large number of users with a few antennas by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces/subarrays at the base station (BS). However, the short wavelength of THz signals combined with a large 6DMA movement range extends the near-field region. As a result, a user can be in the far-field region relative to the antennas on one 6DMA surface, while simultaneously residing in the near-field region relative to other 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, 6DMA THz channel estimation suffers from increased computational complexity and pilot overhead due to uneven power distribution across the large number of candidate position-rotation pairs, as well as the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains in THz bands. To address these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid-field generalized 6DMA THz channel model, which accounts for planar wave propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical waves among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that leverages directional sparsity to construct a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs. Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid-field channel model achieves a sum rate close to that of the ground-truth near-field channel model and confirm that the channel estimation method yields accurate results with low complexity.

Title: Impact of Weather on Satellite Communication: Evaluating Starlink Resilience
Authors: Muhammad Asad Ullah, Antti Heikkinen, Mikko Uitto, Antti Anttonen, Konstantin Mikhaylov
Abstract: Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover. The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud cover of 87.5%

Title: A Multi-Agent AI Framework for Immersive Audiobook Production through Spatial Audio and Neural Narration
Authors: Shaja Arul Selvamani, Nia D'Souza Ganapathy
Abstract: This research introduces an innovative AI-driven multi-agent framework specifically designed for creating immersive audiobooks. Leveraging neural text-to-speech synthesis with FastSpeech 2 and VALL-E for expressive narration and character-specific voices, the framework employs advanced language models to automatically interpret textual narratives and generate realistic spatial audio effects. These sound effects are dynamically synchronized with the storyline through sophisticated temporal integration methods, including Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Diffusion-based generative models combined with higher-order ambisonics (HOA) and scattering delay networks (SDN) enable highly realistic 3D soundscapes, substantially enhancing listener immersion and narrative realism. This technology significantly advances audiobook applications, providing richer experiences for educational content, storytelling platforms, and accessibility solutions for visually impaired audiences. Future work will address personalization, ethical management of synthesized voices, and integration with multi-sensory platforms.

Title: Max-Min Secrecy Rate and Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for RIS-Aided VLC Systems: RSMA Versus NOMA
Authors: Omar Maraqa, Sylvester Aboagye, Majid H. Khoshafa, Telex M. N. Ngatched
Abstract: Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution. Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE performances are provided.

Title: Accurate and Fast Channel Estimation for Fluid Antenna Systems with Diffusion Models
Authors: Erqiang Tang, Wei Guo, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for next-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains -- particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in high-dimensional FAS.

Title: Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Time-Frequency Phase-Shifted Pilots
Authors: Jinke Tang, Xiqi Gao, Li You, Ding Shi, Jiyuan Yang, Xiang-Gen Xia, Xinwei Zhao, Peigang Jiang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency phase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a triple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices and the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of TB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are simultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present the optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling algorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach (IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific structure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a low-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the efficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference with low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel estimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs, the channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.

Title: Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing
Authors: Tianyi Liao, Wei Guo, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.

Title: Learning Linearized Models from Nonlinear Systems under Initialization Constraints with Finite Data
Authors: Lei Xin, Baike She, Qi Dou, George Chiu, Shreyas Sundaram
Abstract: The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.

Title: Dynamic Precoding for Near-Field Secure Communications: Implementation and Performance Analysis
Authors: Zihao Teng, Jiancheng An, Christos Masouros, Hongbin Li, Lu Gan, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in next-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field communications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in near-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios. Specifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) applied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix are significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be exploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture incorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any undesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's performance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, achievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of the secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that only enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits the unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve secure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves approximately 20\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the weighted minimum mean squared error precoders.

Title: LVLM-MPC Collaboration for Autonomous Driving: A Safety-Aware and Task-Scalable Control Architecture
Authors: Kazuki Atsuta, Kohei Honda, Hiroyuki Okuda, Tatsuya Suzuki
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) integration framework that delivers both task scalability and safety for Autonomous Driving (AD). LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.

Title: A Vehicle System for Navigating Among Vulnerable Road Users Including Remote Operation

P. Kooij, Georgios Papaioannou, Barys Shyrokau, Dariu M. Gavrila
Abstract: We present a vehicle system capable of navigating safely and efficiently around Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists. The system comprises key modules for environment perception, localization and mapping, motion planning, and control, integrated into a prototype vehicle. A key innovation is a motion planner based on Topology-driven Model Predictive Control (T-MPC). The guidance layer generates multiple trajectories in parallel, each representing a distinct strategy for obstacle avoidance or non-passing. The underlying trajectory optimization constrains the joint probability of collision with VRUs under generic uncertainties. To address extraordinary situations ("edge cases") that go beyond the autonomous capabilities - such as construction zones or encounters with emergency responders - the system includes an option for remote human operation, supported by visual and haptic guidance. In simulation, our motion planner outperforms three baseline approaches in terms of safety and efficiency. We also demonstrate the full system in prototype vehicle tests on a closed track, both in autonomous and remotely operated modes.

Title: Semi-Explicit Solution of Some Discrete-Time Mean-Field-Type Games with Higher-Order Costs
Authors: Julian Barreiro-Gomez, Tyrone E. Duncan, Bozenna Pasik-Duncan, Hamidou Tembine
Abstract: Traditional solvable game theory and mean-field-type game theory (risk-aware games) predominantly focus on quadratic costs due to their analytical tractability. Nevertheless, they often fail to capture critical non-linearities inherent in real-world systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for solving discrete-time game problems with higher-order state and strategy costs involving power-law terms. We derive semi-explicit expressions for equilibrium strategies, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic, stochastic, and multi-agent system settings by convex-completion techniques. The contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. Our results provide a foundational methodology for analyzing non linear multi-agent systems under higher-order penalization, bridging classical game theory and mean-field-type game theory with modern computational tools for engineering applications.

Title: Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication
Authors: Jinhe Huang, Yongkang Cheng, Yuming Hang, Gaoge Han, Jinewei Li, Jing Zhang, Xingjian Gu
Abstract: Full-body gestures play a pivotal role in natural interactions and are crucial for achieving effective communication. Nevertheless, most existing studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness, coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more powerful support for effective communication.

Title: How to Infer Repeat Structures in MIDI Performances
Authors: Silvan Peter, Patricia Hu, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: MIDI performances are generally expedient in performance research and music information retrieval, and even more so if they can be connected to a score. This connection is usually established by means of alignment, linking either notes or time points between the score and the performance. The first obstacle when trying to establish such an alignment is that a performance realizes one (out of many) structural versions of the score that can plausibly result from instructions such as repeats, variations, and navigation markers like 'dal segno/da capo al coda'. A score needs to be unfolded, that is, its repeats and navigation markers need to be explicitly written out to create a single timeline without jumps matching the performance, before alignment algorithms can be applied. In the curation of large performance corpora this process is carried out manually, as no tools are available to infer the repeat structure of the performance. To ease this process, we develop a method to automatically infer the repeat structure of a MIDI performance, given a symbolically encoded score including repeat and navigation markers. The intuition guiding our design is: 1) local alignment of every contiguous section of the score with a section of a performance containing the same material should receive high alignment gain, whereas local alignment with any other performance section should accrue a low or zero gain. And 2) stitching local alignments together according to a valid structural version of the score should result in an approximate full alignment and correspondingly high global accumulated gain if the structural version corresponds to the performance, and low gain for all other, ill-fitting structural versions.

Title: ReverbMiipher: Generative Speech Restoration meets Reverberation Characteristics Controllability
Authors: Wataru Nakata, Yuma Koizumi, Shigeki Karita, Robin Scheibler, Haruko Ishikawa, Adriana Guevara-Rukoz, Heiga Zen, Michiel Bacchiani
Abstract: Reverberation encodes spatial information regarding the acoustic source environment, yet traditional Speech Restoration (SR) usually completely removes reverberation. We propose ReverbMiipher, an SR model extending parametric resynthesis framework, designed to denoise speech while preserving and enabling control over reverberation. ReverbMiipher incorporates a dedicated ReverbEncoder to extract a reverb feature vector from noisy input. This feature conditions a vocoder to reconstruct the speech signal, removing noise while retaining the original reverberation characteristics. A stochastic zero-vector replacement strategy during training ensures the feature specifically encodes reverberation, disentangling it from other speech attributes. This learned representation facilitates reverberation control via techniques such as interpolation between features, replacement with features from other utterances, or sampling from a latent space. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm ReverbMiipher effectively preserves reverberation, removes other artifacts, and outperforms the conventional two-stage SR and convolving simulated room impulse response approach. We further demonstrate its ability to generate novel reverberation effects through feature manipulation.

Title: Pairing Real-Time Piano Transcription with Symbol-level Tracking for Precise and Robust Score Following
Authors: Silvan Peter, Patricia Hu, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: Real-time music tracking systems follow a musical performance and at any time report the current position in a corresponding score. Most existing methods approach this problem exclusively in the audio domain, typically using online time warping (OLTW) techniques on incoming audio and an audio representation of the score. Audio OLTW techniques have seen incremental improvements both in features and model heuristics which reached a performance plateau in the past ten years. We argue that converting and representing the performance in the symbolic domain -- thereby transforming music tracking into a symbolic task -- can be a more effective approach, even when the domain transformation is imperfect. Our music tracking system combines two real-time components: one handling audio-to-note transcription and the other a novel symbol-level tracker between transcribed input and score. We compare the performance of this mixed audio-symbolic approach with its equivalent audio-only counterpart, and demonstrate that our method outperforms the latter in terms of both precision, i.e., absolute tracking error, and robustness, i.e., tracking success.

Title: SSH-Net: A Self-Supervised and Hybrid Network for Noisy Image Watermark Removal
Authors: Wenyang Liu, Jianjun Gao, Kim-Hui Yap
Abstract: Visible watermark removal is challenging due to its inherent complexities and the noise carried within images. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised learning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and watermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and Hybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net synthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in a self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task. The upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a lightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle the more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise, incorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture intricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared CNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common features that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Integrating Communication, Sensing, and Security: Progress and Prospects of PLS in ISAC Systems
Authors: Waqas Aman, El-Mehdi Illi, Marwa Qaraqe, Saif Al-Kuwari
Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability, coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions, independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular, the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality, communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network designs.

Title: FLAM: Frame-Wise Language-Audio Modeling
Authors: Yusong Wu, Christos Tsirigotis, Ke Chen, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Aaron Courville, Oriol Nieto, Prem Seetharaman, Justin Salamon
Abstract: Recent multi-modal audio-language models (ALMs) excel at text-audio retrieval but struggle with frame-wise audio understanding. Prior works use temporal-aware labels or unsupervised training to improve frame-wise capabilities, but they still lack fine-grained labeling capability to pinpoint when an event occurs. While traditional sound event detection models can precisely localize events, they are limited to pre-defined categories, making them ineffective for real-world scenarios with out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce FLAM, an open-vocabulary contrastive audio-language model capable of localizing specific sound events. FLAM employs a memory-efficient and calibrated frame-wise objective with logit adjustment to address spurious correlations, such as event dependencies and label imbalances during training. To enable frame-wise supervision, we leverage a large-scale dataset with diverse audio events, LLM-generated captions and simulation. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that FLAM significantly improves the open-vocabulary localization capability while maintaining strong performance in global retrieval and downstream tasks.

Title: Hearing and Seeing Through CLIP: A Framework for Self-Supervised Sound Source Localization
Authors: Sooyoung Park, Arda Senocak, Joon Son Chung
Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models demonstrate strong multimodal alignment and generalization across diverse tasks. Among them, CLIP stands out as one of the most successful approaches. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings. These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects. We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance alignment. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate that our method, in all variants, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves strong generalization in zero-shot settings.

Title: Joint Super-Resolution and Segmentation for 1-m Impervious Surface Area Mapping in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt
Authors: Jie Deng, Danfeng Hong, Chenyu Li, Naoto Yokoya
Abstract: We propose a novel joint framework by integrating super-resolution and segmentation, called JointSeg, which enables the generation of 1-meter ISA maps directly from freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. JointSeg was trained on multimodal cross-resolution inputs, offering a scalable and affordable alternative to traditional approaches. This synergistic design enables gradual resolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial textures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective cross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex urban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA mapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area of over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m ESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an F1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by 9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%. In densely urbanized areas (e.g., Suzhou, Nanjing), ISA-1 reduces ISA overestimation through improved discrimination of green spaces and water bodies. Conversely, in mountainous regions (e.g., Ganzi, Zhaotong), it identifies significantly more ISA due to its enhanced ability to detect fragmented anthropogenic features such as rural roads and sparse settlements, demonstrating its robustness across diverse landscapes. Moreover, we present biennial ISA maps from 2017 to 2023, capturing spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics across representative cities. The results highlight distinct regional growth patterns: rapid expansion in upstream cities, moderate growth in midstream regions, and saturation in downstream metropolitan areas.

Title: An automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for lung cancer diagnosis by detecting and classifying the lung nodules
Authors: Samiul Based Shuvo, Tasnia Binte Mamun
Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Title: On Incremental Stability of Interconnected Switched Systems
Authors: Bhabani Shankar Dey, Indra Narayan Kar, Pushpak Jagtap
Abstract: In this paper, the incremental stability of interconnected switched nonlinear systems is discussed. The nature of switching considered is state-dependent. The incremental stability of the switched interconnected system is a stronger property compared to the conventional notion of stability. Even if individual systems in the interconnected setting are stable, guaranteeing stability for the overall system is challenging. However, one of the important features of incremental stability is that the notion is preserved over interconnection. Here, leveraging the contraction-theoretic tools, we derive a set of sufficient conditions for the overall interconnection consisting of bimodal switched systems. To showcase the wider usability of our proposed results, we have also included the effect of external input, which leads to the study of incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$-ISS). For the case of feedback interconnection, the small gain characterisation is presented for the overall system's $\delta$-ISS. Further, for a special case of feedback, i.e., cascade interconnection, the results are derived. The derived conditions are based on the matrix measure, making it computationally tractable and general. To make the results more general, a generalised interconnection of bimodal switched systems is studied and corresponding sufficient condition for $\delta$-ISS are presented. Two numerical examples are demonstrated and supported with simulation results to verify the theoretical claims.

Title: Fast Whole-Body Strain Regulation in Continuum Robots
Authors: Lekan Molu
Abstract: We propose reaching steps towards the real-time strain control of multiphysics, multiscale continuum soft robots. To study this problem fundamentally, we ground ourselves in a model-based control setting enabled by mathematically precise dynamics of a soft robot prototype. Poised to integrate, rather than reject, inherent mechanical nonlinearities for embodied compliance, we first separate the original robot dynamics into separate subdynamics -- aided by a perturbing time-scale separation parameter. Second, we prescribe a set of stabilizing nonlinear backstepping controllers for regulating the resulting subsystems' strain dynamics. Third, we study the interconnected singularly perturbed system by analyzing and establishing its stability. Fourth, our theories are backed up by fast numerical results on a single arm of the Octopus robot arm. We demonstrate strain regulation to equilibrium, in a significantly reduced time, of the whole-body reduced-order dynamics of an infinite degrees-of-freedom soft robot. This paper communicates our thinking within the backdrop of embodied intelligence: it informs our conceptualization, formulation, computational setup, and yields improved control performance for infinite degrees-of-freedom soft robots.

Title: Learning Stable Koopman Embeddings for Identification and Control
Authors: Fletcher Fan, Bowen Yi, David Rye, Guodong Shi, Ian R. Manchester
Abstract: This paper introduces new model parameterizations for learning discrete-time dynamical systems from data via the Koopman operator and studies their properties. Whereas most existing works on Koopman learning do not take into account the stability or stabilizability of the model -- two fundamental pieces of prior knowledge about a given system to be identified -- in this paper, we propose new classes of Koopman models that have built-in guarantees of these properties. These guarantees are achieved through a novel {\em direct parameterization approach} that leads to {\em unconstrained} optimization problems over their parameter sets. {These results rely on the invertibility of the vector fields for autonomous systems and the generalized feedback linearizability (under smooth feedback), respectively.} To explore the representational flexibility of these model sets, we establish the theoretical connections between the stability of discrete-time Koopman embedding and contraction-based forms of nonlinear stability and stabilizability. The proposed approach is illustrated in applications to stable nonlinear system identification and imitation learning via stabilizable models. Simulation results empirically show that the proposed learning approaches outperform prior methods lacking stability guarantees.

Title: Formulating the Restoration of Distribution Networks as a Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem
Authors: Ran Wei, Arindam K. Das, Payman Arabshahi, Daniel S. Kirschen
Abstract: Severe weather events can cause extensive damage to electrical distribution networks, requiring a multi-day restoration effort. Optimizing the dispatch of repair crews minimizes the severe socio-economic consequences of such events. Considering both repair times and travel times, we use graphical manipulations to transform this multiple crew scheduling problem into a type of traveling salesman problem(TSP). Specifically, we demonstrate that the restoration problem bears major resemblance to an instance of a cost constrained reward maximizing mTSP (multiple TSP) on node and edge weighted (doubly weighted) graphs (a variant we dub the CCRM-mTSP-DW), where the objective is to maximize the aggregate reward earned during the upcoming restoration window, provided no crew violates its time budget and electrical continuity constraints are met. Despite the rich history of research on the TSP and its variants, this CCRM-mTSP-DW variant has not been studied before, although its closest cousin happens to be the "Selective TSP" (S-TSP). This reinterpretation of the restoration problem not only opens up the possibility of drawing on existing solution methods developed for the TSP and its variants, it also adds a new chapter in the annals of research on "TSP-like'' problems. In this paper, we propose a "TSP-like'' mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving the restoration problem and validate it on the IEEE PES 123-node test feeder network.

Title: WaveSleepNet: An Interpretable Network for Expert-like Sleep Staging
Authors: Yan Pei, Wei Luo
Abstract: Although deep learning algorithms have proven their efficiency in automatic sleep staging, the widespread skepticism about their "black-box" nature has limited its clinical acceptance. In this study, we propose WaveSleepNet, an interpretable neural network for sleep staging that reasons in a similar way to sleep experts. In this network, we utilize the latent space representations generated during training to identify characteristic wave prototypes corresponding to different sleep stages. The feature representation of an input signal is segmented into patches within the latent space, each of which is compared against the learned wave prototypes. The proximity between these patches and the wave prototypes is quantified through scores, indicating the prototypes' presence and relative proportion within the signal. The scores are served as the decision-making criteria for final sleep staging. During training, an ensemble of loss functions is employed for the prototypes' diversity and robustness. Furthermore, the learned wave prototypes are visualized by analysing occlusion sensitivity. The efficacy of WaveSleepNet is validated across three public datasets, achieving sleep staging performance that are on par with the state-of-the-art models when several WaveSleepNets are combine into a larger network. A detailed case study examined the decision-making process of the WaveSleepNet which aligns closely with American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual guidelines. Another case study systematically explained the misidentified reason behind each sleep stage. WaveSleepNet's transparent process provides specialists with direct access to the physiological significance of its criteria, allowing for future adaptation or enrichment by sleep experts.

Title: Context-Enhanced CSI Tracking Using Koopman-Inspired Dual Autoencoders in Dynamic Wireless Environments
Authors: Anis Hamadouche, Mathini Sellathurai
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for Channel State Information (CSI) tracking and prediction, integrating Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAE) and learned Koopman operator to represent CSI as a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by exogenous contextual inputs. The proposed method enables real-time updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), ensuring enhanced reliability and responsiveness of communication systems in dynamic environments. The architecture consists of dual autoencoders: one for CSI and another for contextual information, coupled through a lifted state space where the Koopman operator captures the linear evolution of CSI dynamics. By combining Koopman operator theory, state space representation, and real-time CSI reconstruction, this work offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic CSI tracking. These findings highlight the potential of Physics-Informed Autoencoders to revolutionize communication systems by delivering accurate, real-time CSI predictions while maintaining stringent data privacy standards.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are vital in modern traffic management and optimization, significantly enhancing traffic efficiency and safety. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing complex challenges within ITS. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of diffusion models for ITS, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. First, we introduce the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, including conditional diffusion models and latent diffusion models, highlighting their suitability for modeling complex, multi-modal traffic data and enabling controllable generation. Second, we outline the primary challenges in ITS and the corresponding advantages of diffusion models, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the intersection between ITS and diffusion models. Third, we offer a multi-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory prediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further investigation. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for ITS, thereby advancing their future applications in the transportation domain.

Borhani, Alpay Medetalibeyoglu, Gorkem Durak, Ulas Bagci
Abstract: Liver cirrhosis represents the end stage of chronic liver disease, characterized by extensive fibrosis and nodular regeneration that significantly increases mortality risk. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive assessment, accurately segmenting cirrhotic livers presents substantial challenges due to morphological alterations and heterogeneous signal characteristics. Deep learning approaches show promise for automating these tasks, but progress has been limited by the absence of large-scale, annotated datasets. Here, we present CirrMRI600+, the first comprehensive dataset comprising 628 high-resolution abdominal MRI scans (310 T1-weighted and 318 T2-weighted sequences, totaling nearly 40,000 annotated slices) with expert-validated segmentation labels for cirrhotic livers. The dataset includes demographic information, clinical parameters, and histopathological validation where available. Additionally, we provide benchmark results from 11 state-of-the-art deep learning experiments to establish performance standards. CirrMRI600+ enables the development and validation of advanced computational methods for cirrhotic liver analysis, potentially accelerating progress toward automated Cirrhosis visual staging and personalized treatment planning.

Title: Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems
Authors: Luke Bhan, Peijia Qin, Miroslav Krstic, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.

Abstract: This paper investigates event-triggered consensus tracking in nonlinear semi-strict-feedback multi-agent systems involving one leader and multiple followers. We first employ radial basis function neural networks and backstepping techniques to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics, facilitating the design of dual observers to measure the unknown states and disturbances. Then three adaptive event-triggered control schemes are proposed: fixed-threshold, relative-threshold, and switched-threshold configurations, each featuring specialized controller architectures and triggering mechanisms. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we establish that the follower agents can asymptotically track the reference trajectory of the leader, meanwhile all error signals remain uniform bounded. Our proposed control strategies effectively prevent Zeno behaviors through stringent exclusion criteria. Finally, an illustrative example is presented, demonstrating the competitive performance of our control framework in achieving consensus tracking and optimizing triggering efficiency.

Title: AirMorph: Topology-Preserving Deep Learning for Pulmonary Airway Analysis
Authors: Minghui Zhang, Chenyu Li, Fangfang Xie, Yaoyu Liu, Hanxiao Zhang, Junyang Wu, Chunxi Zhang, Jie Yang, Jiayuan Sun, Guang-Zhong Yang, Yun Gu
Abstract: Accurate anatomical labeling and analysis of the pulmonary structure and its surrounding anatomy from thoracic CT is getting increasingly important for understanding the etilogy of abnormalities or supporting targetted therapy and early interventions. Whilst lung and airway cell atlases have been attempted, there is a lack of fine-grained morphological atlases that are clinically deployable. In this work, we introduce AirMorph, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions that can be used to create digital atlases of the lung. Evaluated across large-scale multi-center datasets comprising diverse pulmonary conditions, the AirMorph consistently outperformed existing segmentation and labeling methods in terms of accuracy, topological consistency, and completeness. To simplify clinical interpretation, we further introduce a compact anatomical signature quantifying critical morphological airway features, including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. When applied to various pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation, and reticular opacities, it demonstrates strong discriminative power, revealing disease-specific morphological patterns with high interpretability and explainability. Additionally, AirMorph supports efficient automated branching pattern analysis, potentially enhancing bronchoscopic navigation planning and procedural safety, offering a valuable clinical tool for improved diagnosis, targeted treatment, and personalized patient care.

Title: PhaseMO: A Universal Massive MIMO Architecture for Sustainable NextG
Authors: Adel Heidari, Agrim Gupta, Ish Kumar Jain, Dinesh Bharadia
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of devices and increasing data traffic in cellular networks necessitate advanced solutions to meet these escalating demands. Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology offers a promising approach, significantly enhancing throughput, coverage, and spatial multi-plexing. Despite its advantages, massive MIMO systems often lack flexible software controls over hardware, limiting their ability to optimize operational expenditure (OpEx) by reducing power consumption while maintaining performance. Current software-controlled methods, such as antenna muting combined with digital beamforming and hybrid beamforming, have notable limitations. Antenna muting struggles to maintain throughput and coverage, while hybrid beamforming faces hardware constraints that restrict scalability and future-proofing. This work presents PhaseMO, a versatile approach that adapts to varying network loads. PhaseMO effectively reduces power consumption in low-load scenarios without sacrificing coverage and overcomes the hardware limitations of hybrid beamforming, offering a scalable and future-proof solution. We will show that PhaseMO can achieve up to 30% improvement in energy efficiency while avoiding about 10% coverage reduction and 5dB increase in UE transmit power.

Title: Proxy Prompt: Endowing SAM and SAM 2 with Auto-Interactive-Prompt for Medical Segmentation
Authors: Wang Xinyi, Kang Hongyu, Wei Peishan, Shuai Li, Yu Sun, Sai Kit Lam, Yongping Zheng
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to address the unmet demand for automated prompting and enhanced human-model interactions of SAM and SAM2 for the sake of promoting their widespread clinical adoption. Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.

Title: On Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear Dynamic Model Learning: A Gaussian Process Approach
Authors: Yuhan Liu, Máté Kiss, Roland Tóth, Maarten Schoukens
Abstract: While optimal input design for linear systems has been well-established, no systematic approach exists for nonlinear systems where robustness to extrapolation/interpolation errors is prioritized over minimizing estimated parameter variance. To address this issue, we develop a novel space-filling input design strategy for nonlinear system identification that ensures data coverage of a given region of interest. By placing a Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the joint input-state space, the proposed strategy leverages the GP posterior variance to construct a cost function that promotes space-filling input design. Consequently, this enables maximization of the coverage in the region of interest, thereby facilitating the generation of informative datasets. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that minimization of the cost function implies the space-filling property of the obtained data. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on both an academic and a mass-spring-damper example, highlighting its potential practical impact on efficient exploration of the dynamics of nonlinear systems.

Title: Large AI Model for Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Prediction in 6G OTFS-Based Vehicular Networks
Authors: Jianzhe Xue, Dongcheng Yuan, Zhanxi Ma, Tiankai Jiang, Yu Sun, Haibo Zhou, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: Channel prediction is crucial for high-mobility vehicular networks, as it enables the anticipation of future channel conditions and the proactive adjustment of communication strategies. However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.

Title: Integrating AI for Human-Centric Breast Cancer Diagnostics: A Multi-Scale and Multi-View Swin Transformer Framework
Authors: Farnoush Bayatmakou, Reza Taleei, Milad Amir Toutounchian, Arash Mohammadi
Abstract: Despite advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.

Title: Novel Deep Neural OFDM Receiver Architectures for LLR Estimation
Authors: Erhan Karakoca, Hüseyin Çevik, İbrahim Hökelek, Ali Görçin
Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.

Title: Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization
Authors: Ilayda Yaman, Guoda Tian, Dino Pjanic, Fredrik Tufvesson, Ove Edfors, Zhengya Zhang, Liang Liu
Abstract: Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors like multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations, which also results in reduced execution time and smaller model size. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron. This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. We design three low-complex models tailored for distinct scenarios, and a router that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station and compared to more general models.

Title: Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems
Authors: Yushan Li, Jianping He, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Leveraging Depth Maps and Attention Mechanisms for Enhanced Image Inpainting
Authors: Jin Hyun Park, Harine Choi, Praewa Pitiphat
Abstract: Existing deep learning-based image inpainting methods typically rely on convolutional networks with RGB images to reconstruct images. However, relying exclusively on RGB images may neglect important depth information, which plays a critical role in understanding the spatial and structural context of a scene. Just as human vision leverages stereo cues to perceive depth, incorporating depth maps into the inpainting process can enhance the model's ability to reconstruct images with greater accuracy and contextual awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates both RGB and depth images for enhanced image inpainting. Our models employ a dual encoder architecture, where one encoder processes the RGB image and the other handles the depth image. The encoded features from both encoders are then fused in the decoder using an attention mechanism, effectively integrating the RGB and depth representations. We use two different masking strategies, line and square, to test the robustness of the model under different types of occlusions. To further analyze the effectiveness of our approach, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations to examine the regions of interest the model focuses on during inpainting. We show that incorporating depth information alongside the RGB image significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the depth-integrated model outperforms the baseline, with attention mechanisms further enhancing inpainting performance, as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics and visualization.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has shown great promise in helping ecologists understand the health of animal populations and ecosystems. However, extracting insights from millions of hours of audio recordings requires the development of specialized recognizers. This is typically a challenging task, necessitating large amounts of training data and machine learning expertise. In this work, we introduce a general, scalable and data-efficient system for developing recognizers for novel bioacoustic problems in under an hour. Our system consists of several key components that tackle problems in previous bioacoustic workflows: 1) highly generalizable acoustic embeddings pre-trained for birdsong classification minimize data hunger; 2) indexed audio search allows the efficient creation of classifier training datasets, and 3) precomputation of embeddings enables an efficient active learning loop, improving classifier quality iteratively with minimal wait time. Ecologists employed our system in three novel case studies: analyzing coral reef health through unidentified sounds; identifying juvenile Hawaiian bird calls to quantify breeding success and improve endangered species monitoring; and Christmas Island bird occupancy modeling. We augment the case studies with simulated experiments which explore the range of design decisions in a structured way and help establish best practices. Altogether these experiments showcase our system's scalability, efficiency, and generalizability, enabling scientists to quickly address new bioacoustic challenges.

Title: IntelliCardiac: An Intelligent Platform for Cardiac Image Segmentation and Classification
Authors: Ting Yu Tsai, An Yu, Meghana Spurthi Maadugundu, Ishrat Jahan Mohima, Umme Habiba Barsha, Mei-Hwa F. Chen, Balakrishnan Prabhakaran, Ming-Ching Chang
Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.

Title: A Dataset and Toolkit for Multiparameter Cardiovascular Physiology Sensing on Rings
Authors: Jiankai Tang, Kegang Wang, Yingke Ding, Jiatong Ji, Zeyu Wang, Xiyuxing Zhang, Ping Chen, Yuanchun Shi, Yuntao Wang
Abstract: Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor cardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.

Title: Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines (SUGAR) for Computations in Matlab
Authors: Manel Velasco, Isiah Zaplana, Arnau Dória-Cerezo, Pau Martí
Abstract: Geometric algebra (GA) is a mathematical tool for geometric computing, providing a framework that allows a unified and compact approach to geometric relations which in other mathematical systems are typically described using different more complicated elements. This fact has led to an increasing adoption of GA in applied mathematics and engineering problems. However, the scarcity of symbolic implementations of GA and its inherent complexity, requiring a specific mathematical background, make it challenging and less intuitive for engineers to work with. This prevents wider adoption among more applied professionals. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SUGAR (Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines), an open-source toolbox designed for Matlab and licensed under the MIT License. SUGAR facilitates the translation of GA concepts into Matlab and provides a collection of user-friendly functions tailored for GA computations, including support for symbolic operations. It supports both numeric and symbolic computations in high-dimensional GAs. Specifically tailored for applied mathematics and engineering applications, SUGAR has been meticulously engineered to represent geometric elements and transformations within two and three-dimensional projective and conformal geometric algebras, aligning with established computational methodologies in the literature. Furthermore, SUGAR efficiently handles functions of multivectors, such as exponential, logarithmic, sinusoidal, and cosine functions, enhancing its applicability across various engineering domains, including robotics, control systems, and power electronics. Finally, this work includes four distinct validation examples, demonstrating SUGAR's capabilities across the above-mentioned fields and its practical utility in addressing real-world applied mathematics and engineering problems.

Title: HESSO: Towards Automatic Efficient and User Friendly Any Neural Network Training and Pruning
Authors: Tianyi Chen, Xiaoyi Qu, David Aponte, Colby Banbury, Jongwoo Ko, Tianyu Ding, Yong Ma, Vladimir Lyapunov, Ilya Zharkov, Luming Liang
Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the most popular approaches to effectively compress the heavy deep neural networks (DNNs) into compact sub-networks while retaining performance. The existing methods suffer from multi-stage procedures along with significant engineering efforts and human expertise. The Only-Train-Once (OTO) series has been recently proposed to resolve the many pain points by streamlining the workflow by automatically conducting (i) search space generation, (ii) structured sparse optimization, and (iii) sub-network construction. However, the built-in sparse optimizers in the OTO series, i.e., the Half-Space Projected Gradient (HSPG) family, have limitations that require hyper-parameter tuning and the implicit controls of the sparsity exploration, consequently requires intervening by human expertise. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Efficient Structured Sparse Optimizer (HESSO). HESSO could automatically and efficiently train a DNN to produce a high-performing subnetwork. Meanwhile, it is almost tuning-free and enjoys user-friendly integration for generic training applications. To address another common issue of irreversible performance collapse observed in pruning DNNs, we further propose a Corrective Redundant Identification Cycle (CRIC) for reliably identifying indispensable structures. We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of HESSO and its enhanced version HESSO-CRIC on a variety of applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, including large language model. The numerical results showcase that HESSO can achieve competitive even superior performance to varying state-of-the-arts and support most DNN architectures. Meanwhile, CRIC can effectively prevent the irreversible performance collapse and further enhance the performance of HESSO on certain applications.

Title: C-MORL: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning through Efficient Discovery of Pareto Front
Authors: Ruohong Liu, Yuxin Pan, Linjie Xu, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Pengcheng You, Yize Chen
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) excels at handling rapidly changing preferences in tasks that involve multiple criteria, even for unseen preferences. However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments).

Title: On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations
Authors: Luciano S. Martinez-Rau, Yuxuan Zhang, Bengt Oelmann, Sebastian Bader
Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference. These results offer valuable insights for detecting ...

Title: Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Derek Fan, David A. Copp
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.

Title: Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Cross-language Intelligibility Assessment of Dysarthric Speech
Authors: Eunjung Yeo, Julie Liss, Visar Berisha, David Mortensen
Abstract: Purpose: Speech intelligibility is a critical outcome in the assessment and management of dysarthria, yet most research and clinical practices have focused on English, limiting their applicability across languages. This commentary introduces a conceptual framework--and a demonstration of how it can be implemented--leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a two-tiered conceptual framework consisting of a universal speech model that encodes dysarthric speech into acoustic-phonetic representations, followed by a language-specific intelligibility assessment model that interprets these representations within the phonological or prosodic structures of the target language. We further identify barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights into dysarthric speech, and outline potential AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech necessitates models that are both efficient and scalable, yet constrained by linguistic rules to ensure accurate and language-sensitive assessment. Recent advances in AI provide the foundational tools to support this integration, shaping future directions toward generalizable and linguistically informed assessment frameworks.

Title: Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment
Authors: Zhihao Zhan, Wang Pang, Xiang Zhu, Yechao Bai
Abstract: In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.

Title: MaskAttn-UNet: A Mask Attention-Driven Framework for Universal Low-Resolution Image Segmentation
Authors: Anzhe Cheng, Chenzhong Yin, Yu Chang, Heng Ping, Shixuan Li, Shahin Nazarian, Paul Bogdan
Abstract: Low-resolution image segmentation is crucial in real-world applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and large-scale scene understanding, where high-resolution data is often unavailable due to computational constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MaskAttn-UNet, a novel segmentation framework that enhances the traditional U-Net architecture via a mask attention mechanism. Our model selectively emphasizes important regions while suppressing irrelevant backgrounds, thereby improving segmentation accuracy in cluttered and complex scenes. Unlike conventional U-Net variants, MaskAttn-UNet effectively balances local feature extraction with broader contextual awareness, making it particularly well-suited for low-resolution inputs. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets with input images rescaled to 128x128 and demonstrate competitive performance across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. Our results show that MaskAttn-UNet achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods at significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making it an efficient and scalable solution for low-resolution segmentation in resource-constrained scenarios.

Title: Proximal Gradient Dynamics and Feedback Control for Equality-Constrained Composite Optimization
Authors: Veronica Centorrino, Francesca Rossi, Francesco Bullo, Giovanni Russo
Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and convex inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these minimization problems, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the minima of the optimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then {for the case of affine constraints}, {by} leveraging tools from contraction theory we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an application to entropy-regularized optimal transport.

Title: A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna for 6G Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas
Authors: Xiaodan Shao, Weidong Mei, Changsheng You, Qingqing Wu, Beixiong Zheng, Cheng-Xiang Wang, Junling Li, Rui Zhang, Robert Schober, Lipeng Zhu, Weihua Zhuang, Xuemin Shen
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and/or 3D rotations of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional antennas. It is thus expected that the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential, 6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation, and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications. We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.

Title: An Efficient GPU-based Implementation for Noise Robust Sound Source Localization
Authors: Zirui Lin, Masayuki Takigahira, Naoya Terakado, Haris Gulzar, Monikka Roslianna Busto, Takeharu Eda, Katsutoshi Itoyama, Kazuhiro Nakadai, Hideharu Amano
Abstract: Robot audition, encompassing Sound Source Localization (SSL), Sound Source Separation (SSS), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), enables robots and smart devices to acquire auditory capabilities similar to human hearing. Despite their wide applicability, processing multi-channel audio signals from microphone arrays in SSL involves computationally intensive matrix operations, which can hinder efficient deployment on Central Processing Units (CPUs), particularly in embedded systems with limited CPU resources. This paper introduces a GPU-based implementation of SSL for robot audition, utilizing the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-based Multiple Signal Classification (GSVD-MUSIC), a noise-robust algorithm, within the HARK platform, an open-source software suite. For a 60-channel microphone array, the proposed implementation achieves significant performance improvements. On the Jetson AGX Orin, an embedded device powered by an NVIDIA GPU and ARM Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUs, we observe speedups of 5648.7x for GSVD calculations and 10.7x for the SSL module, while speedups of 4245.1x for GSVD calculation and 17.3x for the entire SSL module on a server configured with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs, making real-time processing feasible for large-scale microphone arrays and providing ample capacity for real-time processing of potential subsequent machine learning or deep learning tasks.

Title: Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit
Authors: Adrien Corenflos
Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.
