Title: A Generalized Weighted Overlap-Add (WOLA) Filter Bank for Improved Subband System Identification
Authors: Mohit Sharma (1), Robbe Van Rompaey (2), Wouter Lanneer (2), Marc Moonen (1) ((1) Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), KU Leuven, Belgium, (2) Nokia Bell Labs, Antwerp, Belgium)
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain subband adaptive filtering, in particular, subband system identification. Previous studies in this area have primarily focused on setups with subband filtering at a downsampled rate, implemented using the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) filter bank, popular in audio and speech-processing for its reduced complexity. However, this traditional approach imposes constraints on the subband filters when transformed to their full-rate representation. This paper makes three key contributions. First, it introduces a generalized WOLA filter bank that repositions subband filters before the downsampling operation, eliminating the constraints on subband filters inherent in the conventional WOLA filter bank. Second, it investigates the mean square error (MSE) performance of the generalized WOLA filter bank for full-band system identification, establishing analytical ties between the order of subband filters, the full-band system impulse response length, the decimation factor, and the prototype filters. Third, to address the increased computational complexity of the generalized WOLA, the paper proposes a low-complexity implementation termed per-tone weighted overlap-add (PT-WOLA), which maintains computational complexity on par with conventional WOLA. Analytical and empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed generalized WOLA filter bank significantly enhances the performance of subband system identification.

Title: UniUltra: Interactive Parameter-Efficient SAM2 for Universal Ultrasound Segmentation
Authors: Yue Li, Qing Xu, Yixuan Zhang, Xiangjian He, Qian Zhang, Yuan Yao, Fiseha B. Tesem, Xin Chen, Ruili Wang, Zhen Chen, Chang Wen Chen
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrates remarkable universal segmentation capabilities on natural images. However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

Title: Rapid and Accurate Changepoint Detection of Power System Forced Oscillations
Authors: Luke Dosiek, Akaash Karn, Frank Liu
Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.

Title: Development of a velocity form for a class of RNNs, with application to offset-free nonlinear MPC design
Authors: Daniele Ravasio, Bestem Abdulaziz, Marcello Farina, Andrea Ballarino
Abstract: This paper addresses the offset-free tracking problem for nonlinear systems described by a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). To compensate for constant disturbances and guarantee offset-free tracking in the presence of model-plant mismatches, we propose a novel reformulation of the RNN model in velocity form. Conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are then derived for the design of a nonlinear state observer and a nonlinear state-feedback controller, ensuring global or regional closed-loop stability of the origin of the velocity form dynamics. Moreover, to handle input and output constraints, a theoretically sound offset-free nonlinear model predictive control algorithm is developed. The algorithm exploits the velocity form model as the prediction model and the static controller as an auxiliary law for the definition of the terminal ingredients. Simulations on a pH-neutralisation process benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: EEG Emotion Recognition Through Deep Learning
Authors: Roman Dolgopolyi, Antonis Chatzipanagiotou
Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

Title: Cyber-Resilient Data-Driven Event-Triggered Secure Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under False Data Injection Attacks
Authors: Yashar Mousavi, Mahsa Tavasoli, Ibrahim Beklan Kucukdemiral, Umit Cali, Abdolhossein Sarrafzadeh, Ali Karimoddini, Afef Fekih
Abstract: This paper proposes a cyber-resilient secure control framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to false data injection (FDI) threats as actuator attacks. The framework integrates data-driven modeling, event-triggered communication, and fractional-order sliding mode control (FSMC) to enhance the resilience against adversarial interventions. A dynamic model decomposition (DMD)-based methodology is employed to extract the lateral dynamics from real-world data, eliminating the reliance on conventional mechanistic modeling. To optimize communication efficiency, an event-triggered transmission scheme is designed to reduce the redundant transmissions while ensuring system stability. Furthermore, an extended state observer (ESO) is developed for real-time estimation and mitigation of actuator attack effects. Theoretical stability analysis, conducted using Lyapunov methods and linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations, guarantees exponential error convergence. Extensive simulations validate the proposed event-triggered secure control framework, demonstrating substantial improvements in attack mitigation, communication efficiency, and lateral tracking performance. The results show that the framework effectively counteracts actuator attacks while optimizing communication-resource utilization, making it highly suitable for safety-critical AV applications.

Title: Integrated Coexistence for Satellite and Terrestrial Networks with Multistatic ISAC
Authors: Jeongju Jee, Jeffrey G. Andrews
Abstract: Tightly integrated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications and terrestrial integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are expected to be key novel aspects of the 6G era. Spectrum sharing between satellite and terrestrial cellular networks may, however, cause severe interference. This paper introduces a cooperation framework for integrated coexistence between satellite and terrestrial networks where the terrestrial network also deploys multistatic ISAC. Unlike prior works that assume ideal channel state information (CSI) acquisition, the proposed approach develops a practical structure consisting of pre-optimization and refinement stages that leverages the predictability of satellite CSI. In addition, a co-design of terrestrial beamforming and satellite power allocation utilizing a weighted minimum mean-squared error algorithm is proposed, and a target-radar association method designed for multistatic ISAC is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of these integrated networks. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the overall performance approaches the interference-free benchmark as the number of spot beams and radar receivers increases, demonstrating the feasibility of spectral coexistence between the two networks.

Title: What Does It Take to Get Guarantees? Systematizing Assumptions in Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Chengyu Li, Saleh Faghfoorian, Ivan Ruchkin
Abstract: Formal guarantees for cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely on diverse assumptions. If satisfied, these assumptions enable the transfer of abstract guarantees into real-world assurances about the deployed CPS. Although assumptions are central to assured CPS, there is little systematic knowledge about what assumptions are made, what guarantees they support, and what it would take to specify them precisely. To fill this gap, we present a survey of assumptions and guarantees in the control, verification, and runtime assurance areas of CPS literature. From 104 papers over a 10-year span (2014-2024), we extracted 423 assumptions and 321 guarantees using grounded-theory coding. We also annotated the assumptions with 21 tags indicating elementary language features needed for specifications. Our analysis highlighted prevalent trends and gaps in CPS assumptions, particularly related to initialization, sensing, perception, neural components, and uncertainty. Our observations culminated in a call to action on reporting and testing CPS assumptions.

Title: Joint Admission Control and Power Minimization in IRS-assisted Networks
Authors: Weijie Xiong, Jingran Lin, Zhiling Xiao, Qiang Li, Yuhan Zhang
Abstract: Joint admission control and power minimization are critical challenges in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted networks. Traditional methods often rely on \( l_1 \)-norm approximations and alternating optimization (AO) techniques, which suffer from high computational complexity and lack robust convergence guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose a sigmoid-based approximation of the \( l_0 \)-norm AC indicator, enabling a more efficient and tractable reformulation of the problem. Additionally, we introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and admission control, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. This approach reduces computational complexity and supports distributed implementation. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods by achieving lower power consumption, accommodating more users, and reducing computational time.

Title: Physics Informed Multi-task Joint Generative Learning for Arterial Vehicle Trajectory Reconstruction Considering Lane Changing Behavior
Authors: Mengyun Xu, Jie Fang, Eui-Jin Kim, Tony Z. Qiu, Prateek Bansal
Abstract: Reconstructing complete traffic flow time-space diagrams from vehicle trajectories offer a comprehensive view on traffic dynamics at arterial intersections. However, obtaining full trajectories across networks is costly, and accurately inferring lane-changing (LC) and car-following behaviors in multi-lane environments remains challenging. This study proposes a generative framework for arterial vehicle trajectory reconstruction that jointly models lane-changing and car-following behaviors through physics-informed multi-task joint learning. The framework consists of a Lane-Change Generative Adversarial Network (LC-GAN) and a Trajectory-GAN. The LC-GAN models stochastic LC behavior from historical trajectories while considering physical conditions of arterial intersections, such as signal control, geometric configuration, and interactions with surrounding vehicles. The Trajectory-GAN then incorporates LC information from the LC-GAN with initial trajectories generated from physics-based car-following models, refining them in a data-driven manner to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. The proposed framework is designed to reconstruct complete trajectories from only a small subset of connected vehicle (CV) trajectories; for example, even a single observed trajectory per lane, by incorporating partial trajectory information into the generative process. A multi-task joint learning facilitates synergistic interaction between the LC-GAN and Trajectory-GAN, allowing each component to serves as both auxiliary supervision and a physical condition for the other. Validation using two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates that the framework outperforms conventional benchmark models in reconstructing complete time-space diagrams for multi-lane arterial intersections. This research advances the integration of trajectory-based sensing from CVs with physics-informed deep learning.

Title: Train Short, Infer Long: Speech-LLM Enables Zero-Shot Streamable Joint ASR and Diarization on Long Audio
Authors: Mohan Shi, Xiong Xiao, Ruchao Fan, Shaoshi Ling, Jinyu Li
Abstract: Joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization aim to answer the question "who spoke what" in multi-speaker scenarios. In this paper, we present an end-to-end speech large language model (Speech-LLM) for Joint strEamable DIarization and aSr (JEDIS-LLM). The model is trained only on short audio under 20s but is capable of streamable inference on long-form audio without additional training. This is achieved by introducing a Speaker Prompt Cache (SPC) with an on-the-fly update mechanism during chunk-wise streaming inference, inspired by the autoregressive nature of LLMs. The SPC also allows the seamless use of pre-enrolled speaker profiles which is common in many scenarios like meeting transcription. To further enhance diarization capability, we incorporate word-level speaker supervision into the speech encoder during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms strong baselines, including Sortformer and Meta-Cat in the local setting on audio up to 20s, and DiarizationLM on long-form audio, despite being fully end-to-end and streamable while DiarizationLM follows a cascaded offline pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work enabling zero-shot streamable joint ASR and diarization on long audio using a Speech-LLM trained only on short audio, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Bellman Memory Units: A neuromorphic framework for synaptic reinforcement learning with an evolving network topology
Authors: Shreyan Banerjee, Aasifa Rounak, Vikram Pakrashi
Abstract: Application of neuromorphic edge devices for control is limited by the constraints on gradient-free online learning and scalability of the hardware across control problems. This paper introduces a synaptic Q-learning algorithm for the control of the classical Cartpole, where the Bellman equations are incorporated at the synaptic level. This formulation enables the iterative evolution of the network topology, represented as a directed graph, throughout the training process. This is followed by a similar approach called neuromorphic Bellman Memory Units (BMU(s)), which are implemented with the Neural Engineering Framework on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip. Topology evolution, in conjunction with mixed-signal computation, leverages the optimization of the number of neurons and synapses that could be used to design spike-based reinforcement learning accelerators. The proposed architecture can potentially reduce resource utilization on board, aiding the manufacturing of compact application-specific neuromorphic ICs. Moreover, the on-chip learning introduced in this work and implemented on a neuromorphic chip can enable adaptation to unseen control scenarios.

Title: Parallelizable Complex Neural Dynamics Models for PMSM Temperature Estimation with Hardware Acceleration
Authors: Xinyuan Liao, Shaowei Chen, Shuai Zhao
Abstract: Accurate and efficient thermal dynamics models of permanent magnet synchronous motors are vital to efficient thermal management strategies. Physics-informed methods combine model-based and data-driven methods, offering greater flexibility than model-based methods and superior explainability compared to data-driven methods. Nonetheless, there are still challenges in balancing real-time performance, estimation accuracy, and explainability. This paper presents a hardware-efficient complex neural dynamics model achieved through the linear decoupling, diagonalization, and reparameterization of the state-space model, introducing a novel paradigm for the physics-informed method that offers high explainability and accuracy in electric motor temperature estimation tasks. We validate this physics-informed method on an NVIDIA A800 GPU using the JAX machine learning framework, parallel prefix sum algorithm, and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform. We demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and parallelizable hardware acceleration capabilities through experimental evaluation on a real electric motor.

Title: SUNAC: Source-aware Unified Neural Audio Codec
Authors: Ryo Aihara, Yoshiki Masuyama, Francesco Paissan, François G. Germain, Gordon Wichern, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact representations that can be leveraged in many downstream applications, in particular large language models. Yet most NACs encode mixtures of multiple sources in an entangled manner, which may impede efficient downstream processing in applications that need access to only a subset of the sources (e.g., analysis of a particular type of sound, transcription of a given speaker, etc). To address this, we propose a source-aware codec that encodes individual sources directly from mixtures, conditioned on source type prompts. This enables user-driven selection of which source(s) to encode, including separately encoding multiple sources of the same type (e.g., multiple speech signals). Experiments show that our model achieves competitive resynthesis and separation quality relative to a cascade of source separation followed by a conventional NAC, with lower computational cost.

Title: UT-OSANet: A Multimodal Deep Learning model for Evaluating and Classifying Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Authors: Zijian Wang, Xiaoyu Bao, Chenhao Zhao, Jihui Zhang, Sizhi Ai, Yuanqing Li
Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder that is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. While existing diagnostic approaches can roughly classify OSA severity or detect isolated respiratory events, they lack the precision and comprehensiveness required for high resolution, event level diagnosis. Here, we present UT OSANet, a deep learning based model designed as a event level, multi scenario diagnostic tool for OSA. This model facilitates detailed identification of events associated with OSA, including apnea, hypopnea, oxygen desaturation, and arousal. Moreover, the model employs flexibly adjustable input modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), airflow, and SpO 2. It utilizes a random masked modality combination training strategy, allowing it to comprehend cross-modal relationships while sustaining consistent performance across varying modality conditions. This model was trained and evaluated utilizing 9,021 polysomnography (PSG) recordings from five independent datasets. achieving sensitivities up to 0.93 and macro F1 scores of 0.84, 0.85 across home, clinical, and research scenarios. This model serves as an event-level, multi-scenario diagnostic instrument for real-world applications of OSA, while also establishing itself as a means to deepen the mechanistic comprehension of respiratory processes in sleep disorders and their extensive health implications.

Title: Describing Functions and Phase Response Curves of Excitable Systems
Authors: Robin Wroblowski, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: The describing function (DF) and phase response curve (PRC) are classical tools for the analysis of feedback oscillations and rhythmic behaviors, widely used across control engineering, biology, and neuroscience. These tools are known to have limitations in networks of relaxation oscillators and excitable systems. For this reason, the paper proposes a novel approach tailored to excitable systems. Our analysis focuses on the discrete-event operator mapping input trains of events to output trains of events. The methodology is illustrated on the excitability model of Hodgkin-Huxley. The proposed framework provides a basis for designing and analyzing central pattern generators in networks of excitable neurons, with direct relevance to neuromorphic control and neurophysiology.

Title: Robust Self-Triggered Control Approaches Optimizing Sensors Utilization with Asynchronous Measurements
Authors: Abbas Tariverdi
Abstract: Most control systems run on digital hardware with limited communication resources. This work develops self-triggered control for linear systems where sensors update independently (asynchronous measurements). The controller computes an optimal horizon at each sampling instant, selecting which sensor to read over the next several time steps to maximize inter-sample intervals while maintaining stability. Two implementations address computational complexity. The online version solves an optimization problem at each update for theoretical optimality. The offline version precomputes optimal horizons using conic partitioning, reducing online computation to a lookup. Both guarantee exponential stability for unperturbed systems and global uniform ultimate boundedness for systems with bounded disturbances. Simulations demonstrate 59-74\% reductions in sensor utilization compared to periodic sampling. The framework enables resource-efficient control in networked systems with communication constraints.

Title: Low-Complexity Rydberg Array Reuse: Modeling and Receiver Design for Sparse Channels
Authors: Hao Wu, Shanchi Wu, Xinyuan Yao, Rui Ni, Chen Gong
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.

Title: Weakly Supervised Segmentation and Classification of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregates in Brightfield Midbrain Images
Authors: Erwan Dereure, Robin Louiset, Laura Parkkinen, David A Menassa, David Holcman
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.

Title: Dynamic Multiple-Parameter Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform and its Intelligent Filtering Methods
Authors: Manjun Cui, Ziqi Yan, Yangfan He, Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: Dynamic graph signal processing provides a principled framework for analyzing time-varying data defined on irregular graph domains. However, existing joint time-vertex transforms such as the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform assign only one fractional order to the spatial domain and another one to the temporal domain, thereby restricting their capacity to model the complex and continuously varying dynamics of graph signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dynamic multiple-parameter joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (DMPJFRFT) framework, which introduces time-varying fractional parameters to achieve adaptive spectral modeling of dynamic graph structures. By assigning distinct fractional orders to each time step, the proposed transform enables dynamic and flexible representation of spatio-temporal signal evolution in the joint time-vertex spectral domain. Theoretical properties of the DMPJFRFT are systematically analyzed, and two filtering approaches: a gradient descent-based method and a neural network-based method, are developed for dynamic signal restoration. Experimental results on dynamic graph and video datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively captures temporal topology variations and achieves superior performance in denoising and deblurring tasks compared with some state-of-the-art graph-based transforms and neural networks.

Title: Spatially Dependent Sampling of Component Failures for Power System Preventive Control Against Hurricane
Authors: Ziyue Li, Guanglun Zhang, Grant Ruan, Haiwang Zhong, Chongqing Kang
Abstract: Preventive control is a crucial strategy for power system operation against impending natural hazards, and its effectiveness fundamentally relies on the realism of scenario generation. While most existing studies employ sequential Monte Carlo simulation and assume independent sampling of component failures, this oversimplification neglects the spatial correlations induced by meteorological factors such as hurricanes. In this paper, we identify and address the gap in modeling spatial dependence among component failures under extreme weather. We analyze how the mean, variance, and correlation structure of weather intensity random variables influence the correlation of component failures. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially dependent sampling method that enables joint sampling of multiple component failures by generating correlated meteorological intensity random variables. Comparative studies show that our approach captures long-tailed scenarios and reveals more extreme events than conventional methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of scenario selection on preventive control performance. Our key findings are: (1) Strong spatial correlations in uncertain weather intensity consistently lead to interdependent component failures, regardless of mean value level; (2) The proposed method uncovers more high-severity scenarios that are missed by independent sampling; (3) Preventive control requires balancing load curtailment and over-generation costs under different scenario severities; (4) Ignoring failure correlations results in underestimating risk from high-severity events, undermining the robustness of preventive control strategies.

Title: Revealing computation-communication trade-off in Segmented Pinching Antenna System (PASS)
Authors: Deqiao Gan, Xiaoxia Xu, Xiaohu Ge, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A joint communication and computation (JCC) framework using segmented pinching antenna system (PASS) is proposed, where both the communication bit streams and computation data are simultaneously transmitted via uplink communications. The segmented PASS design is used to yield the tractable uplink transmission, and to mitigate large-scale path loss and in-waveguide loss. Based on three operating protocols, namely segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM), the joint transmit and receive beamforming problem is formulated: 1) The mean square error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated for computation-oriented cases. To address this problem, a low-complexity alternating optimization-minimum mean square error (AO-MMSE) algorithm is developed. This problem is decomposed into receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems that are iteratively optimized by MMSE receivers to obtain the closed-form solutions. It is mathematically proved that the segmented JCC-PASS framework significantly outperforms the conventional PASS for the average in-waveguide propagation gain. 2) The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated for communication-oriented cases. To solve the decomposed receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems, the AO-weighted minimum mean square error (AO-WMMSE) algorithm is further developed. An auxiliary weight variable is introduced to linearize the WSR function and is alternatively optimized based on WMMSE to derive the closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed JCC-PASS framework achieves up to 70.65% and 45.32% reductions in MSE compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, and ii) it reaches 87.70% and 51.35% improvements in WSR compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, respectively.

Title: VersaPants: A Loose-Fitting Textile Capacitive Sensing System for Lower-Body Motion Capture
Authors: Deniz Kasap (1), Taraneh Aminosharieh Najafi (1), Jérôme Paul Rémy Thevenot (1), Jonathan Dan (1), Stefano Albini (1), David Atienza (1) ((1) École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL))
Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

Title: Neural Positioning Without External Reference
Authors: Till-Yannic Müller, Frederik Zumegen, Reinhard Wiesmayr, Emre Gönültaş, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI)-based user equipment (UE) positioning with neural networks -- referred to as neural positioning -- is a promising approach for accurate off-device UE localization. Most existing methods train their neural networks with ground-truth position labels obtained from external reference positioning systems, which requires costly hardware and renders label acquisition difficult in large areas. In this work, we propose a novel neural positioning pipeline that avoids the need for any external reference positioning system. Our approach trains the positioning network only using CSI acquired off-device and relative displacement commands executed on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) robot platforms, such as robotic vacuum cleaners -- such an approach enables inexpensive training of accurate neural positioning functions over large areas. We evaluate our method in three real-world scenarios, ranging from small line-of-sight (LoS) areas to larger non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments, using CSI measurements acquired in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio (NR) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed neural positioning pipeline achieves UE localization accuracies close to state-of-the-art methods that require externally acquired high-precision ground-truth position labels for training.

Title: Reasoning Meets Representation: Envisioning Neuro-Symbolic Wireless Foundation Models
Authors: Jaron Fontaine, Mohammad Cheraghinia, John Strassner, Adnan Shahid, Eli De Poorter
Abstract: Recent advances in Wireless Physical Layer Foundation Models (WPFMs) promise a new paradigm of universal Radio Frequency (RF) representations. However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap. We envision a novel Neuro-Symbolic framework that integrates universal RF embeddings with symbolic knowledge graphs and differentiable logic layers. This hybrid approach enables models to learn from large datasets while reasoning over explicit domain knowledge, enabling trustworthy, generalizable, and efficient wireless AI that can meet the demands of future networks.

Title: A Comprehensive Study on Cyber Attack Vectors in EV Traction Power Electronics
Authors: Siddhesh Pimpale
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have drastically changed the auto industry and developed a new era of technologies where power electronics play the leading role in traction management, energy conversion and vehicle control processes. Nevertheless, this is a digital transformation, and the cyber-attack surface area has increased considerably, to the point that EV traction power electronics are becoming vulnerable to various cybersecurity risks. This paper is able to provide its expertise on possible cyber-attack vectors which can attack important parts of the traction, powertrain, including things like inverters, motor controllers, and communicated systems within the embedded bits. Using the (STRIDE) threat modeling framework, the research outlines and groups the vulnerabilities of the architecture and runs some attack simulations, such as the Denial of Service (DoS), spoofing, firmware manipulation, and data injection. The experiments prove the fact that a slight interruption in the control signal, the sensed data may lead to the severe working implications, such as unstable sensor values of the torque, abnormal voltage shifts, and entire system freezes. These results highlight the high priority on the need of injective embedded intrusion preventive mechanisms and secure design of firmware in EV powertrain electronics. In this paper, the author makes his contribution to the general body of knowledge that underpins the links existing between cyber security practices and the peculiar needs of automotive power electronics.

Title: Energy-Efficient and Actuator-Friendly Control Under Wave Disturbances: Model Reference vs. PID for Thruster Surge
Authors: Anıl Erdinç Türetken, Hakan Ersoy, Aslihan Kartci
Abstract: In this study, we compare a model reference control (MRC) strategy against conventional PID controllers (tuned via metaheuristic algorithms) for surge velocity control of a thruster-driven marine system, under combined wave disturbance and sensor noise. The goal is to evaluate not only tracking performance but also control energy usage and actuator stress. A high-order identified model of a Blue Robotics T200 thruster with a 2~kg vehicle is used, with an 8~N sinusoidal wave disturbance applied and white noise ( added to the speed measurement. Results show that the optimized MRC (MRC-R*) yields the lowest control energy and smoothest command among all controllers, while maintaining acceptable tracking. The IMC-based design performs closely. In contrast, PID controllers achieve comparable RMS tracking error but at the cost of excessive actuator activity and energy use, making them impractical in such scenarios. Future

Title: Second-Order MPC-Based Distributed Q-Learning
Authors: Samuel Mallick, Filippo Airaldi, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: The state of the art for model predictive control (MPC)-based distributed Q-learning is limited to first-order gradient updates of the MPC parameterization. In general, using secondorder information can significantly improve the speed of convergence for learning, allowing the use of higher learning rates without introducing instability. This work presents a second-order extension to MPC-based Q-learning with updates distributed across local agents, relying only on locally available information and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In simulation the approach is demonstrated to significantly outperform first-order distributed Q-learning.

Title: Tube-Based Model Predictive Control with Random Fourier Features for Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Ákos M. Bokor, Tamás Dózsa, Felix Biertümpfel, Ádám Szabó
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient approach for robust Model Predictive Control of nonlinear systems by combining Random Fourier Features with tube-based MPC. Tube-based Model Predictive Control provides robust constraint satisfaction under bounded model uncertainties arising from approximation errors and external disturbances. The Random Fourier Features method approximates nonlinear system dynamics by solving a numerically tractable least-squares problem, thereby reducing the approximation error. We develop the integration of RFF-based residual learning with tube MPC and demonstrate its application to an autonomous vehicle path-tracking problem using a nonlinear bicycle model. Compared to the linear baseline, the proposed method reduces the tube size by approximately 50%, leading to less conservative behavior and resulting in around 70% smaller errors in the test scenario. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves real-time performance while maintaining provable robustness guarantees.

Title: Observer Design for Singularly Perturbed Linear Networked Control Systems Subject to Measurement Noise
Authors: Weixuan Wang, Alejandro I. Maass, Dragan Nešić, Ying Tan, Romain Postoyan, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for linear networked control systems (NCS) operating at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

Title: 3-20 GHz Wideband Tightly-Coupled Dual-Polarized Vivaldi Antenna Array
Authors: Niko Lindvall, Mikko Heino, Mikko Valkama
Abstract: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.

Title: TFCDiff: Robust ECG Denoising via Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion
Authors: Pengxin Li, Yimin Zhou, Jie Min, Yirong Wang, Wei Liang, Wang Li
Abstract: Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are prone to mixed noise from physical activities, including baseline wander (BW), muscle artifact (MA), and electrode motion artifact (EM). Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.

Authors: Wei-Cheng Tseng, David Harwath
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural audio codecs have not only enabled superior audio compression but also enhanced speech synthesis techniques. Researchers are now exploring their potential as universal acoustic feature extractors for a broader range of speech processing tasks. Building on this trend, we introduce Codec2Vec, the first speech representation learning framework that relies exclusively on discrete audio codec units. This approach offers several advantages, including improved data storage and transmission efficiency, faster training, and enhanced data privacy. We explore masked prediction with various training target derivation strategies to thoroughly understand the effectiveness of this framework. Evaluated on the SUPERB benchmark, Codec2Vec achieves competitive performance compared to continuous-input models while reducing storage requirements by up to 16.5x and training time by 2.3x, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.

Title: Attention-Based Feature Online Conformal Prediction for Time Series
Authors: Meiyi Zhu, Caili Guo, Chunyan Feng, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

Title: L-JacobiNet and S-JacobiNet: An Analysis of Adaptive Generalization, Stabilization, and Spectral Domain Trade-offs in GNNs
Authors: Huseyin Goksu
Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

Title: HybSpecNet: A Critical Analysis of Architectural Instability in Hybrid-Domain Spectral GNNs
Authors: Huseyin Goksu
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

Title: Physics-informed Gaussian Processes as Linear Model Predictive Controller with Constraint Satisfaction
Authors: Jörn Tebbe, Andreas Besginow, Markus Lange-Hegermann
Abstract: Model Predictive Control evolved as the state of the art paradigm for safety critical control tasks. Control-as-Inference approaches thereof model the constrained optimization problem as a probabilistic inference problem. The constraints have to be implemented into the inference model. A recently introduced physics-informed Gaussian Process method uses Control-as-Inference with a Gaussian likelihood for state constraint modeling, but lacks guarantees of open-loop constraint satisfaction. We mitigate the lack of guarantees via an additional sampling step using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling in order to obtain safe rollouts of the open-loop dynamics which are then used to obtain an approximation of the truncated normal distribution which has full probability mass in the safe area. We provide formal guarantees of constraint satisfaction while maintaining the ODE structure of the Gaussian Process on a discretized grid. Moreover, we show that we are able to perform optimization of a quadratic cost function by closed form Gaussian Process computations only and introduce the Matérn kernel into the inference model.

Title: Optimizing Operation Recipes with Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Interpretable Control of Chemical Processes
Authors: Dean Brandner, Sergio Lucia
Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Title: CorrectHDL: Agentic HDL Design with LLMs Leveraging High-Level Synthesis as Reference
Authors: Kangwei Xu, Grace Li Zhang, Ulf Schlichtmann, Bing Li
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL this http URL input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Title: A convex approach for Markov chain estimation from aggregate data via inverse optimal transport
Authors: Michele Mascherpa, Axel Ringh, Amirhossein Taghvaei, Johan Karlsson
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying the dynamical law governing the evolution of a population of indistinguishable particles, when only aggregate distributions at successive times are observed. Assuming a Markovian evolution on a discrete state space, the task reduces to estimating the underlying transition probability matrix from distributional data. We formulate this inverse problem within the framework of entropic optimal transport, as a joint optimization over the transition matrix and the transport plans connecting successive distributions. This formulation results in a convex optimization problem, and we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the entropic proximal method. We illustrate the accuracy and convergence of the method in two numerical setups, considering estimation from independent snapshots and estimation from a time series of aggregate observations, respectively.

Title: Saving Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems
Authors: Yuxiang Wan, Ryan Devera, Wenjie Zhang, Ju Sun
Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

Title: Auditable Ledger Snapshot for Non-Repudiable Cross-Blockchain Communication
Authors: Tirthankar Sengupta, Bishakh Chandra Ghosh, Sandip Chakraborty, Shamik Sural
Abstract: Blockchain interoperability is increasingly recognized as the centerpiece for robust interactions among decentralized services. Blockchain ledgers are generally tamper-proof and thus enforce non-repudiation for transactions recorded within the same network. However, such a guarantee does not hold for cross-blockchain transactions. When disruptions occur due to malicious activities or system failures within one blockchain network, foreign networks can take advantage by denying legitimate claims or mounting fraudulent liabilities against the defenseless network. In response, this paper introduces InterSnap, a novel blockchain snapshot archival methodology, for enabling auditability of crossblockchain transactions, enforcing non-repudiation. InterSnap introduces cross-chain transaction receipts that ensure their irrefutability. Snapshots of ledger data along with these receipts are utilized as non-repudiable proof of bilateral agreements among different networks. InterSnap enhances system resilience through a distributed snapshot generation process, need-based snapshot scheduling process, and archival storage and sharing via decentralized platforms. Through a prototype implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric, we conducted experiments using on-premise machines, AWS public cloud instances, as well as a private cloud infrastructure. We establish that InterSnap can recover from malicious attacks while preserving crosschain transaction receipts. Additionally, our proposed solution demonstrates adaptability to increasing loads while securely transferring snapshot archives with minimal overhead.

Title: Synthesis of Safety Specifications for Probabilistic Systems
Authors: Gaspard Ohlmann, Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Francesco Belardinelli
Abstract: Ensuring that agents satisfy safety specifications can be crucial in safety-critical environments. While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.

Title: Variational Quantum Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Ivana Nikoloska, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication functionalities within a common system is one of the main innovation drivers for next-generation networks. In this paper, we introduce a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol that leverages entanglement in quantum carriers of information to enable both superdense coding and quantum sensing. The proposed approach adaptively optimizes encoding and quantum measurement via variational circuit learning, while employing classical machine learning-based decoders and estimators to process the measurement outcomes. Numerical results for qudit systems demonstrate that the proposed QISAC protocol can achieve a flexible trade-off between classical communication rate and accuracy of parameter estimation.

Title: SAM2S: Segment Anything in Surgical Videos via Semantic Long-term Tracking
Authors: Haofeng Liu, Ziyue Wang, Sudhanshu Mishra, Mingqi Gao, Guanyi Qin, Chang Han Low, Alex Y. W. Kong, Yueming Jin
Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization. Code and dataset will be released at this https URL.

Title: Adaptive Guided Upsampling for Low-light Image Enhancement
Authors: Angela Vivian Dcosta, Chunbo Song, Rafael Radkowski
Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Title: Stabilizing Policy Gradient Methods via Reward Profiling
Authors: Shihab Ahmed, El Houcine Bergou, Aritra Dutta, Yue Wang
Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Title: OptimizedDP: An Efficient, User-friendly Library For Optimal Control and Dynamic Programming
Authors: Minh Bui, Hanyang Hu, Chong He, Michael Lu, George Giovanis, Arrvindh Shriraman, Mo Chen
Abstract: This paper introduces OptimizedDP, a high-performance software library for several common grid-based dynamic programming (DP) algorithms used in control theory and robotics. Specifically, OptimizedDP provides functions to numerically solve a class of time-dependent (dynamic) Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equations (PDEs), time-independent (static) HJ PDEs, and additionally value iteration for continuous action-state space Markov Decision Processes (MDP). The computational complexity of grid-based DP is exponential with respect to the number of grid or state space dimensions, and thus can have bad execution runtimes and memory usage whenapplied to large state spaces. We leverage the user-friendliness of Python for different problem specifications without sacrificing the efficiency of the core computation. This is achieved by implementing the core part of the code which the user does not see in heterocl, a framework we use to abstract away details of how computation is parallelized. Compared to similar toolboxes for level set methods that are used to solve the HJ PDE, our toolbox makes solving the PDE at higher dimensions possible as well as achieving an order of magnitude improvements in execution times, while keeping the interface easy for specifying different problem descriptions. Because of that, the toolbox has been adopted to solve control and optimization problems that were considered intractable before. Our toolbox is available publicly at this https URL.

Title: Differentially-Private Distributed Model Predictive Control of Linear Discrete-Time Systems with Global Constraints
Authors: Kaixiang Zhang, Yongqiang Wang, Ziyou Song, Zhaojian Li
Abstract: Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) has attracted extensive attention as it can explicitly handle system constraints and achieve optimal control in a decentralized manner. However, the deployment of DMPC strategies generally requires the sharing of sensitive data among subsystems, which may violate the privacy of participating systems. In this paper, we propose a differentially-private DMPC algorithm for linear discrete-time systems subject to coupled global constraints. Specifically, we first show that a conventional distributed dual gradient algorithm can be used to address the considered DMPC problem but cannot provide strong privacy preservation. Then, to protect privacy against the eavesdropper, we incorporate a differential-privacy noise injection mechanism into the DMPC framework and prove that the resulting distributed optimization algorithm can ensure both provable convergence to a global optimal solution and rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy. In addition, an implementation strategy of the DMPC is designed such that the recursive feasibility and stability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.

Title: CardioLab: Laboratory Values Estimation from Electrocardiogram Features - An Exploratory Study
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Laboratory value represents a cornerstone of medical diagnostics, but suffers from slow turnaround times, and high costs and only provides information about a single point in time. The continuous estimation of laboratory values from non-invasive data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) would therefore mark a significant frontier in healthcare monitoring. Despite its potential, this domain remains relatively underexplored. In this preliminary study, we used a publicly available dataset (MIMIC-IV-ECG) to investigate the feasibility of inferring laboratory values from ECG features and patient demographics using tree-based models (XGBoost). We define the prediction task as a binary problem of whether the lab value falls into low or high abnormalities. We assessed model performance with AUROC. Our findings demonstrate promising results in the estimation of laboratory values related to different organ systems. While further research and validation are warranted to fully assess the clinical utility and generalizability of the approach, our findings lay the groundwork for future investigations for laboratory value estimation using ECG data. Such advancements hold promise for revolutionizing predictive healthcare applications, offering faster, non-invasive, and more affordable means of patient monitoring.

Title: Estimation of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Diagnosis from Electrocardiogram Features
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis of medical conditions is paramount for effective patient care. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are fundamental for evaluating a patient's cardiac health and are readily available. Despite this, little attention has been given to the remarkable potential of ECG data in detecting non-cardiac conditions. In our study, we used publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD and ECG-VIEW II) to investigate the feasibility of inferring general diagnostic conditions from ECG features. To this end, we trained a tree-based model (XGBoost) based on ECG features and basic demographic features to estimate a wide range of diagnoses, encompassing both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate the reliability of estimating 23 cardiac as well as 21 non-cardiac conditions above 0.7 AUROC in a statistically significant manner across a wide range of physiological categories. Our findings underscore the predictive potential of ECG data in identifying well-known cardiac conditions. However, even more striking, this research represents a pioneering effort in systematically expanding the scope of ECG-based diagnosis to conditions not traditionally associated with the cardiac system.

Title: LEARNER: Contrastive Pretraining for Learning Fine-Grained Patient Progression from Coarse Inter-Patient Labels
Authors: Jana Armouti, Nikhil Madaan, Rohan Panda, Tom Fox, Laura Hutchins, Amita Krishnan, Ricardo Rodriguez, Bennett DeBoisblanc, Deva Ramanan, John Galeotti, Gautam Gare
Abstract: Predicting whether a treatment leads to meaningful improvement is a central challenge in personalized medicine, particularly when disease progression manifests as subtle visual changes over time. While data-driven deep learning (DL) offers a promising route to automate such predictions, acquiring large-scale longitudinal data for each individual patient remains impractical. To address this limitation, we explore whether inter-patient variability can serve as a proxy for learning intra-patient progression. We propose LEARNER, a contrastive pretraining framework that leverages coarsely labeled inter-patient data to learn fine-grained, patient-specific representations. Using lung ultrasound (LUS) and brain MRI datasets, we demonstrate that contrastive objectives trained on coarse inter-patient differences enable models to capture subtle intra-patient changes associated with treatment response. Across both modalities, our approach improves downstream classification accuracy and F1-score compared to standard MSE pretraining, highlighting the potential of inter-patient contrastive learning for individualized outcome prediction.

Title: Explainable machine learning for neoplasms diagnosis via electrocardiograms: an externally validated study
Authors: Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: Background: Neoplasms are a major cause of mortality globally, where early diagnosis is essential for improving outcomes. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, expensive, and inaccessible in resource-limited settings. This study explores the potential of electrocardiogram (ECG) data, a widely available and non-invasive tool for diagnosing neoplasms through cardiovascular changes linked to neoplastic presence. Methods: A diagnostic pipeline combining tree-based machine learning models with Shapley value analysis for explainability was developed. The model was trained and internally validated on a large dataset and externally validated on an independent cohort to ensure robustness and generalizability. Key ECG features contributing to predictions were identified and analyzed. Results: The model achieved high diagnostic accuracy in both internal testing and external validation cohorts. Shapley value analysis highlighted significant ECG features, including novel predictors. The approach is cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for resource-limited settings, offering insights into cardiovascular changes associated with neoplasms and their therapies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ECG signals and machine learning for non-invasive neoplasm diagnosis. By providing interpretable insights into cardio-neoplasm interactions, this method addresses gaps in diagnostics and supports integration into broader diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks.

Title: Low-Complexity Frequency-Dependent Linearizers Based on Parallel Bias-Modulus and Bias-ReLU Operations
Authors: Deijany Rodriguez Linares, Håkan Johansson
Abstract: This paper introduces low-complexity frequency-dependent (memory) linearizers designed to suppress nonlinear distortion in analog-to-digital interfaces. Two different linearizers are considered, based on nonlinearity models which correspond to sampling before and after the nonlinearity operations, respectively. The proposed linearizers are inspired by convolutional neural networks but have an order-of-magnitude lower implementation complexity compared to existing neural-network-based linearizer schemes. The proposed linearizers can also outperform the traditional parallel Hammerstein (as well as Wiener) linearizers even when the nonlinearities have been generated through a Hammerstein model. Further, a design procedure is proposed in which the linearizer parameters are obtained through matrix inversion. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming iterative nonconvex optimization which is traditionally associated with neural network training. The design effectively handles a wide range of wideband multi-tone signals and filtered white noise. Examples demonstrate significant signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) improvements of some $20$--$30$ dB, as well as a lower implementation complexity than the Hammerstein linearizers.

Title: Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review
Authors: Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Hankun Wang, Bohan Li, Chongtian Shao, Hanglei Zhang, Chenpeng Du, Xie Chen, Shujie Liu, Kai Yu
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.

Title: Barrier-Riccati Synthesis for Nonlinear Safe Control with Expanded Region of Attraction
Authors: Hassan Almubarak, Maitham F. AL-Sunni, Justin T. Dubbin, Nader Sadegh, John M. Dolan, Evangelos A. Theodorou
Abstract: We present a Riccati-based framework for safety-critical nonlinear control that integrates the barrier states (BaS) methodology with the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach. The BaS formulation embeds safety constraints into the system dynamics via auxiliary states, enabling safety to be treated as a control objective. To overcome the limited region of attraction in linear BaS controllers, we extend the framework to nonlinear systems using SDRE synthesis applied to the barrier-augmented dynamics and derive a matrix inequality condition that certifies forward invariance of a large region of attraction and guarantees asymptotic safe stabilization. The resulting controller is computed online via pointwise Riccati solutions. We validate the method on an unstable constrained system and cluttered quadrotor navigation tasks, demonstrating improved constraint handling, scalability, and robustness near safety boundaries. This framework offers a principled and computationally tractable solution for synthesizing nonlinear safe feedback in safety-critical environments.

Title: Renewable-Colocated Green Hydrogen Production: Optimality, Profitability, and Policy Impacts
Authors: Siying Li, Lang Tong, Timothy Mount, Kanchan Upadhyay, Harris Eisenhardt, Pradip Kumar
Abstract: We study the optimal green hydrogen production and energy market participation of a renewable-colocated hydrogen producer (RCHP) that utilizes onsite renewable generation for both hydrogen production and grid services. Under deterministic and stochastic profit-maximization frameworks, we analyze RCHP's multiple market participation models and derive closed-form optimal scheduling policies that dynamically allocate renewable energy to hydrogen production and electricity export to the wholesale market. Analytical characterizations of the RCHP's operating profit and the optimal sizing of renewable and electrolyzer capacities are obtained. We use real-time renewable production and electricity price data from three independent system operators to assess impacts from market prices and environmental policies of renewable energy and green hydrogen subsidies on RCHP's profitability.

Title: CSI-Bench: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Dataset for Multi-task WiFi Sensing
Authors: Guozhen Zhu, Yuqian Hu, Weihang Gao, Wei-Hsiang Wang, Beibei Wang, K. J. Ray Liu
Abstract: WiFi sensing has emerged as a compelling contactless modality for human activity monitoring by capturing fine-grained variations in Channel State Information (CSI). Its ability to operate continuously and non-intrusively while preserving user privacy makes it particularly suitable for health monitoring. However, existing WiFi sensing systems struggle to generalize in real-world settings, largely due to datasets collected in controlled environments with homogeneous hardware and fragmented, session-based recordings that fail to reflect continuous daily activity. We present CSI-Bench, a large-scale, in-the-wild benchmark dataset collected using commercial WiFi edge devices across 26 diverse indoor environments with 35 real users. Spanning over 461 hours of effective data, CSI-Bench captures realistic signal variability under natural conditions. It includes task-specific datasets for fall detection, breathing monitoring, localization, and motion source recognition, as well as a co-labeled multitask dataset with joint annotations for user identity, activity, and proximity. To support the development of robust and generalizable models, CSI-Bench provides standardized evaluation splits and baseline results for both single-task and multi-task learning. CSI-Bench offers a foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving WiFi sensing systems in health and broader human-centric applications.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a sliding mode controller using the backstepping approach. The controller is employed to synthesize tracking errors and Lyapunov functions. A novel state-space representation is formulated by incorporating the dynamics of the quadrotor and accounting for non-holonomic constraints. The proposed sliding mode controller effectively addresses system nonlinearities and improves tracking of predefined trajectories. Simulation results are presented graphically to demonstrate the controller's performance.

Title: Theoretical Guarantees for AOA-based Localization: Consistency and Asymptotic Efficiency
Authors: Shenghua Hu, Guangyang Zeng, Wenchao Xue, Haitao Fang, Biqiang Mu
Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using angle of arrival (AOA) measurements. We begin by presenting verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment that ensure the model's asymptotic localizability. Then we establish the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose an asymptotically efficient two-step estimator that matches the ML estimator's asymptotic properties while achieving low computational complexity (linear in the number of measurements). The primary challenge lies in obtaining a consistent estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear least squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.

Title: Neuromorphic Split Computing via Optical Inter-Satellite Links
Authors: Zihang Song, Petar Popovski
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic split-computing framework for energy-efficient low-latency inference over optical inter-satellite links. The system partitions a spiking neural network (SNN) between edge and core nodes. To transmit sparse spiking features efficiently, we introduce a lossless channel-block-sparse event representation that exploits inter- and intra-channel sparsity. We employ hierarchical error protection using multi-level forward error correction and cyclic redundancy checks to ensure reliable communication without retransmission. The framework uses end-to-end training with sparsity and clustering regularizers, combined with channel-aware stochastic masking to optimize feature compression and channel robustness jointly. In a proof-of-concept implementation on remote sensing imagery, the framework achieves over $10 \times$ reduction in both computational energy and transmission load compared to conventional dense split systems, with less than 1% accuracy loss. The proposed approach also outperforms address-event-based split SNNs by $3.7 \times$ in transmission efficiency and shows superior resilience to optical pointing jitter.

Title: Depression diagnosis from patient interviews using multimodal machine learning
Authors: Jana Weber, Marcel Weber, Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz
Abstract: Background: Depression is a major public health concern, affecting an estimated five percent of the global population. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to initiate effective treatment, yet recognition remains challenging in many clinical contexts. Speech, language, and behavioral cues collected during patient interviews may provide objective markers that support clinical assessment. Methods: We developed a diagnostic approach that integrates features derived from patient interviews, including speech patterns, linguistic characteristics, and structured clinical information. Separate models were trained for each modality and subsequently combined through multimodal fusion to reflect the complexity of real-world psychiatric assessment. Model validity was assessed with established performance metrics, and further evaluated using calibration and decision-analytic approaches to estimate potential clinical utility. Results: The multimodal model achieved superior diagnostic accuracy compared to single-modality models, with an AUROC of 0.88 and a macro F1-score of 0.75. Importantly, the fused model demonstrated good calibration and offered higher net clinical benefit compared to baseline strategies, highlighting its potential to assist clinicians in identifying patients with depression more reliably. Conclusion: Multimodal analysis of patient interviews using machine learning may serve as a valuable adjunct to psychiatric evaluation. By combining speech, language, and clinical features, this approach provides a robust framework that could enhance early detection of depressive disorders and support evidence-based decision-making in mental healthcare.

Title: Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch
Authors: Penggao Ya, Li-Ta Hsu, Rui Sun
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.

Title: Gamma-Based Statistical Modeling for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar
Authors: Vinay Kulkarni, V. V. Reddy
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth, provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple scatterers originating from a single automotive target, commonly referred to as an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling based on the Gamma distribution, facilitated through Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU) and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection accuracy.

Title: UniVoice: Unifying Autoregressive ASR and Flow-Matching based TTS with Large Language Models
Authors: Wenhao Guan, Zhikang Niu, Ziyue Jiang, Kaidi Wang, Peijie Chen, Qingyang Hong, Lin Li, Xie Chen
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems, gradually becoming the mainstream approach. However, most current approaches address these tasks separately rather than through a unified framework. This work aims to integrate these two tasks into one unified model. Although discrete speech tokenization enables joint modeling, its inherent information loss limits performance in both recognition and generation. In this work, we present UniVoice, a unified LLM framework through continuous representations that seamlessly integrates speech recognition and synthesis within a single model. Our approach combines the strengths of autoregressive modeling for speech recognition with flow matching for high-quality generation. To mitigate the inherent divergence between autoregressive and flow-matching models, we further design a dual attention mechanism, which switches between a causal mask for recognition and a bidirectional attention mask for synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed text-prefix-conditioned speech infilling method enables high-fidelity zero-shot voice cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve or exceed current single-task modeling methods in both ASR and zero-shot TTS tasks. This work explores new possibilities for end-to-end speech understanding and generation. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: FxSearcher: gradient-free text-driven audio transformation
Authors: Hojoon Ki, Jongsuk Kim, Minchan Kwon, Junmo Kim
Abstract: Achieving diverse and high-quality audio transformations from text prompts remains challenging, as existing methods are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a limited set of differentiable audio effects. This paper proposes FxSearcher, a novel gradient-free framework that discovers the optimal configuration of audio effects (FX) to transform a source signal according to a text prompt. Our method employs Bayesian Optimization and CLAP-based score function to perform this search efficiently. Furthermore, a guiding prompt is introduced to prevent undesirable artifacts and enhance human preference. To objectively evaluate our method, we propose an AI-based evaluation framework. The results demonstrate that the highest scores achieved by our method on these metrics align closely with human preferences. Demos are available at this https URL

Title: Ultra-Low Insertion Loss Stepped Impedance Resonator Topology for HTSC RF Front-End
Authors: Ilan Kurtser, Yoav Koral, Eldad Holdengreber, Shmuel E. Schacham, Eliyahu Farber
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and measurement of a high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR) band-pass filter for S-band applications, and its incorporation into a cryogenic receiver cascade. The 11-pole filter, implemented in YBa2Cu3O(7-x) (YBCO) thin films on sapphire, exhibits an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of -0.1~dB, a sharp roll-off of 100~MHz, and a rejection level exceeding --80~dB. These measured results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported IL for an S-band filter with this number of poles. When integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA), system-level simulations and measurements predict a receiver noise figure (NF) of 0.34~dB at 3.39~GHz, enabling a 20% increase in radar detection range compared with conventional copper-based front ends. This work demonstrates the feasibility of practical HTSC-based RF front-ends for next-generation communication and radar systems.

Title: A Continuous sEMG-Based Prosthetic Hand Control System Without Motion or Force Sensors
Authors: Gang Liu, Ye Sun, Zhenxiang Wang, Chuanmei Xi, Ziyang He, Shanshan Guo, Rui Zhang, Dezhong Yao
Abstract: Regressively-based surface electromyography (sEMG) prosthetics are widely used for their ability to continuously convert muscle activity into finger force and motion. However, they typically require additional kinematic or dynamic sensors, which increases complexity and limits practical application. To address this, this paper proposes a method based on the simplified near-linear relationship between sEMG and finger force, using the near-linear model ResDD proposed in this work. By applying the principle that a line can be determined by two points, we eliminate the need for complex sensor calibration. Specifically, by recording the sEMG during maximum finger flexion and extension, and assigning corresponding forces of 1 and -1, the ResDD model can fit the simplified relationship between sEMG signals and force, enabling continuous prediction and control of finger force and gestures. Offline experiments were conducted to evaluate the model's classification accuracy and its ability to learn sufficient information. It uses interpolation analysis to open up the internal structure of the trained model and checks whether the fitted curve of the model conforms to the nearly linear relationship between sEMG and force. Finally, online control and sine wave tracking experiments were carried out to further verify the practicality of the proposed method. The results show that the method effectively extracts meaningful information from sEMG and accurately decodes them. The near-linear model sufficiently reflects the expected relationship between sEMG and finger force. Fitting this simplified near-linear relationship is adequate to achieve continuous and smooth control of finger force and gestures, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: MMVA: Multimodal Matching Based on Valence and Arousal across Images, Music, and Musical Captions
Authors: Suhwan Choi, Kyu Won Kim, Myungjoo Kang
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal Matching based on Valence and Arousal (MMVA), a tri-modal encoder framework designed to capture emotional content across images, music, and musical captions. To support this framework, we expand the Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet) dataset, creating IMEMNet-C which includes 24,756 images and 25,944 music clips with corresponding musical captions. We employ multimodal matching scores based on the continuous valence (emotional positivity) and arousal (emotional intensity) values. This continuous matching score allows for random sampling of image-music pairs during training by computing similarity scores from the valence-arousal values across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in valence-arousal prediction tasks. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in various zeroshot tasks, highlighting the potential of valence and arousal predictions in downstream applications.

Title: System Filter-Based Common Components Modeling for Cross-Subject EEG Decoding
Authors: Xiaoyuan Li, Xinru Xue, Bohan Zhang, Ye Sun, Shoushuo Xi, Gang Liu
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the brain and external devices through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing decoding models often mix common and personalized components, leading to interference from individual variability that limits cross-subject decoding performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a system filter that extends the concept of signal filtering to the system level. The method expands a system into its spectral representation, selectively removes unnecessary components, and reconstructs the system from the retained target components, thereby achieving explicit system-level decomposition and filtering. We further integrate the system filter into a Cross-Subject Decoding framework based on the System Filter (CSD-SF) and evaluate it on the four-class motor imagery (MI) task of the BCIC IV 2a dataset. Personalized models are transformed into relation spectrums, and statistical testing across subjects is used to remove personalized components. The remaining stable relations, representing common components across subjects, are then used to construct a common model for cross-subject decoding. Experimental results show an average improvement of 3.28% in decoding accuracy over baseline methods, demonstrating that the proposed system filter effectively isolates stable common components and enhances model robustness and generalizability in cross-subject EEG decoding.

Title: To Trust or Not to Trust: On Calibration in ML-based Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks
Authors: Rashika Raina, Nidhi Simmons, David E. Simmons, Michel Daoud Yacoub, Trung Q. Duong
Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.

Title: Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior
Authors: Peng N. Wang, Peter B. Luh, Xuesong Lu, Peter Sincak, Laura Pitukova
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.

Title: Bayesian Learning for Pilot Decontamination in Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Christian Forsch, Zilu Zhao, Dirk Slock, Laura Cottatellucci
Abstract: Pilot contamination (PC) arises when the pilot sequences assigned to user equipments (UEs) are not mutually orthogonal, eventually due to their reuse. In this work, we propose a novel expectation propagation (EP)-based joint channel estimation and data detection (JCD) algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the effects of PC in the uplink of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MaMIMO) systems. This modified bilinear-EP algorithm is distributed, scalable, demonstrates strong robustness to PC, and outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian learning algorithms. Through a comprehensive performance evaluation, we assess the performance of Bayesian learning algorithms for different pilot sequences and observe that the use of non-orthogonal pilots can lead to better performance compared to shared orthogonal sequences. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce a new metric to quantify PC at the UE level. We show that the performance of the considered algorithms degrades monotonically with respect to this metric, providing a valuable theoretical and practical tool for understanding and managing PC via iterative JCD algorithms.

Title: Pitch Estimation With Mean Averaging Smoothed Product Spectrum And Musical Consonance Evaluation Using MASP
Authors: Murat Yasar Baskin
Abstract: This study introduces Mean Averaging Smoothed Product (MASP) Spectrum, which is a modified version of the Harmonic Product Spectrum, designed to enhance pitch estimation for many algorithm-wise deceptive frequency spectra that still lead clear pitches, for both harmonic and inharmonic cases. By introducing a global mean based smoothing for spectrum, the MASP algorithm diminishes the unwanted sensitivity of HPS for spectra with missing partials. The method exhibited robust pitch estimations consistent with perceptual expectations. Motivated upon the strong correlation between consonance and periodicity, the same algorithm is extended and, with the proposition of a harmonicity measure (H), used to evaluate musical consonance for two and three tones; yielding consonance hierarchies that align with perception and practice of music theory. These findings suggest that perception of pitch and consonance may share a similar underlying mechanism that depend on spectrum.

Title: Statistically Assuring Safety of Control Systems using Ensembles of Safety Filters and Conformal Prediction
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Yuxuan Yang, Hussein Sibai
Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

Title: A digital SRAM-based compute-in-memory macro for weight-stationary dynamic matrix multiplication in Transformer attention score computation
Authors: Jianyi Yu, Tengxiao Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Xiang Fu, Ying Wang, Fei Qiao, Liyuan Liu, Cong Shi
Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) techniques are widely employed in energy-efficient artificial intelligent (AI) processors. They alleviate power and latency bottlenecks caused by extensive data movements between compute and storage units. This work proposes a digital CIM macro to compute Transformer attention. To mitigate dynamic matrix multiplication that is unsuitable for the common weight-stationary CIM paradigm, we reformulate the attention score computation process based on a combined QK-weight matrix, so that inputs can be directly fed to CIM cells to obtain the score results. Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders. The proposed CIM macro was implemented using a 65-nm process. It occupied only 0.35 mm2 area, and delivered a 42.27 GOPS peak performance with 1.24 mW power consumption at a 1.0 V power supply and a 100 MHz clock frequency, resulting in 34.1 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120.77 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency. When compared to the CPU and GPU, our CIM macro is 25x and 13x more energy efficient on practical tasks, respectively. Compared with other Transformer-CIMs, our design exhibits at least 7x energy efficiency and at least 2x area efficiency improvements when scaled to the same technology node, showcasing its potential for edge-side intelligent applications.

Title: Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos
Authors: Kranti Kumar Parida, Omar Emara, Hazel Doughty, Dima Damen
Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.
