Title: Leveraging Depth and Attention Mechanisms for Improved RGB Image Inpainting
Authors: Jin Hyun Park, Harine Choi, Praewa Pitiphat
Abstract: Existing deep learning-based image inpainting methods typically rely on convolutional networks with RGB images to reconstruct images. However, relying exclusively on RGB images may neglect important depth information, which plays a critical role in understanding the spatial and structural context of a scene. Just as human vision leverages stereo cues to perceive depth, incorporating depth maps into the inpainting process can enhance the model's ability to reconstruct images with greater accuracy and contextual awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates both RGB and depth images for enhanced image inpainting. Our models employ a dual encoder architecture, where one encoder processes the RGB image and the other handles the depth image. The encoded features from both encoders are then fused in the decoder using an attention mechanism, effectively integrating the RGB and depth representations. We use two different masking strategies, line and square, to test the robustness of the model under different types of occlusions. To further analyze the effectiveness of our approach, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations to examine the regions of interest the model focuses on during inpainting. We show that incorporating depth information alongside the RGB image significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the depth-integrated model outperforms the baseline, with attention mechanisms further enhancing inpainting performance, as evidenced by multiple evaluation metrics and visualization.

Title: A Survey on 3D Reconstruction Techniques in Plant Phenotyping: From Classical Methods to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and Beyond
Authors: Jiajia Li, Xinda Qi, Seyed Hamidreza Nabaei, Meiqi Liu, Dong Chen, Xin Zhang, Xunyuan Yin, Zhaojian Li
Abstract: Plant phenotyping plays a pivotal role in understanding plant traits and their interactions with the environment, making it crucial for advancing precision agriculture and crop improvement. 3D reconstruction technologies have emerged as powerful tools for capturing detailed plant morphology and structure, offering significant potential for accurate and automated phenotyping. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the 3D reconstruction techniques for plant phenotyping, covering classical reconstruction methods, emerging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and the novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach. Classical methods, which often rely on high-resolution sensors, are widely adopted due to their simplicity and flexibility in representing plant structures. However, they face challenges such as data density, noise, and scalability. NeRF, a recent advancement, enables high-quality, photorealistic 3D reconstructions from sparse viewpoints, but its computational cost and applicability in outdoor environments remain areas of active research. The emerging 3DGS technique introduces a new paradigm in reconstructing plant structures by representing geometry through Gaussian primitives, offering potential benefits in both efficiency and scalability. We review the methodologies, applications, and performance of these approaches in plant phenotyping and discuss their respective strengths, limitations, and future prospects (this https URL). Through this review, we aim to provide insights into how these diverse 3D reconstruction techniques can be effectively leveraged for automated and high-throughput plant phenotyping, contributing to the next generation of agricultural technology.

Title: XeMap: Contextual Referring in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Environments
Authors: Yuxi Li, Lu Si, Yujie Hou, Chengaung Liu, Bin Li, Hongjian Fang, Jun Zhang
Abstract: Advancements in remote sensing (RS) imagery have provided high-resolution detail and vast coverage, yet existing methods, such as image-level captioning/retrieval and object-level detection/segmentation, often fail to capture mid-scale semantic entities essential for interpreting large-scale scenes. To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.

Title: mmSnap: Bayesian One-Shot Fusion in a Self-Calibrated mmWave Radar Network
Authors: Anirban Banik, Lalitha Giridhar, Aaditya Prakash Kattekola, Anurag Pallaprolu, Yasamin Mostofi, Ashutosh Sabharwal, Upamanyu Madhow
Abstract: We present mmSnap, a collaborative RF sensing framework using multiple radar nodes, and demonstrate its feasibility and efficacy using commercially available mmWave MIMO radars. Collaborative fusion requires network calibration, or estimates of the relative poses (positions and orientations) of the sensors. We experimentally validate a self-calibration algorithm developed in our prior work, which estimates relative poses in closed form by least squares matching of target tracks within the common field of view (FoV). We then develop and demonstrate a Bayesian framework for one-shot fusion of measurements from multiple calibrated nodes, which yields instantaneous estimates of position and velocity vectors that match smoothed estimates from multi-frame tracking. Our experiments, conducted outdoors with two radar nodes tracking a moving human target, validate the core assumptions required to develop a broader set of capabilities for networked sensing with opportunistically deployed nodes.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Network-Driven Sparse Field Discretization Method for Near-Field Acoustic Holography
Authors: Xinmeng Luan, Mirco Pezzoli, Fabio Antonacci, Augusto Sarti
Abstract: We propose the Physics-Informed Neural Network-driven Sparse Field Discretization method (PINN-SFD), a novel self-supervised, physics-informed deep learning approach for addressing the Near-Field Acoustic Holography (NAH) problem. Unlike existing deep learning methods for NAH, which are predominantly supervised by large datasets, our approach does not require a training phase and it is physics-informed. The wave propagation field is discretized into sparse regions, a process referred to as field discretization, which includes a series of set of source planes, to address the inverse problem. Our method employs the discretized Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral as the wave propagation model. By incorporating virtual planes, additional constraints are enforced near the actual sound source, improving the reconstruction process. Optimization is carried out using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where physics-based constraints are integrated into the loss functions to account for both direct (from equivalent source plane to hologram plane) and additional (from virtual planes to hologram plane) wave propagation paths. Additionally, sparsity is enforced on the velocity of the equivalent sources. Our comprehensive validation across various rectangular and violin top plates, covering a wide range of vibrational modes, demonstrates that PINN-SFD consistently outperforms the conventional Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM), particularly in terms of reconstruction accuracy for complex vibrational patterns. Significantly, this method demonstrates reduced sensitivity to regularization parameters compared to C-ESM.

Title: Neural Networks Enabled Discovery On the Higher-Order Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation of Traffic Dynamics
Authors: Zihang Wei, Yunlong Zhang, Chenxi Liu, Yang Zhou
Abstract: Modeling the traffic dynamics is essential for understanding and predicting the traffic spatiotemporal evolution. However, deriving the partial differential equation (PDE) models that capture these dynamics is challenging due to their potential high order property and nonlinearity. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, "TRAFFIC-PDE-LEARN", designed to discover hidden PDE models of traffic network dynamics directly from measurement data. By harnessing the power of the neural network to approximate a spatiotemporal fundamental diagram that facilitates smooth estimation of partial derivatives with low-resolution loop detector data. Furthermore, the use of automatic differentiation enables efficient computation of the necessary partial derivatives through the chain and product rules, while sparse regression techniques facilitate the precise identification of physically interpretable PDE components. Tested on data from a real-world traffic network, our model demonstrates that the underlying PDEs governing traffic dynamics are both high-order and nonlinear. By leveraging the learned dynamics for prediction purposes, the results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to advance intelligent transportation systems.

Title: MARS: Defending Unmanned Aerial Vehicles From Attacks on Inertial Sensors with Model-based Anomaly Detection and Recovery
Authors: Haocheng Meng, Shaocheng Luo, Zhenyuan Liang, Qing Huang, Amir Khazraei, Miroslav Pajic
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to maintain stable flight. However, IMUs are susceptible to physical attacks, including acoustic resonant and electromagnetic interference attacks, resulting in immediate UAV crashes. Consequently, we introduce a Model-based Anomaly detection and Recovery System (MARS) that enables UAVs to quickly detect adversarial attacks on inertial sensors and achieve dynamic flight recovery. MARS features an attack-resilient state estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter, which incorporates position, velocity, heading, and rotor speed measurements to reconstruct accurate attitude and angular velocity information for UAV control. Moreover, a statistical anomaly detection system monitors IMU sensor data, raising a system-level alert if an attack is detected. Upon receiving the alert, a multi-stage dynamic flight recovery strategy suspends the ongoing mission, stabilizes the drone in a hovering condition, and then resumes tasks under the resilient control. Experimental results in PX4 software-in-the-loop environments as well as real-world MARS-PX4 autopilot-equipped drones demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing IMU-defense frameworks, showcasing the ability of the UAVs to survive attacks and complete the missions.

Title: WirelessAgent: Large Language Model Agents for Intelligent Wireless Networks
Authors: Jingwen Tong, Wei Guo, Jiawei Shao, Qiong Wu, Zijian Li, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless networks presents unprecedented challenges in managing complex and dynamic systems. Existing methods are increasingly facing fundamental limitations in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we introduce WirelessAgent, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous AI agents for diverse wireless network tasks. This framework integrates four core modules that mirror human cognitive processes: perception, memory, planning, and action. To implement it, we provide a basic usage based on agentic workflows and the LangGraph architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WirelessAgent through a comprehensive case study on network slicing. The numerical results show that WirelessAgent achieves $44.4\%$ higher bandwidth utilization than the \emph{Prompt-based} method, while performing only $4.3\%$ below the \emph{Rule-based optimality}. Notably, WirelessAgent delivers near-optimal network throughput across diverse network scenarios. These underscore the framework's potential for intelligent and autonomous resource management in future wireless networks. The code is available at \url{this https URL}.

Title: Learning Low-Dimensional Embeddings for Black-Box Optimization
Authors: Riccardo Busetto, Manas Mejari, Marco Forgione, Alberto Bemporad, Dario Piga
Abstract: When gradient-based methods are impractical, black-box optimization (BBO) provides a valuable alternative. However, BBO often struggles with high-dimensional problems and limited trial budgets. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.

Title: Impact of Insufficient CP on Sensing Performance in OFDM-ISAC Systems
Authors: Peishi Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu, Ming Li
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely considered a leading waveform candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G networks. However, the cyclic prefix (CP) used to mitigate multipath effects in communication systems also limits the maximum sensing range. Target echoes arriving beyond the CP length cause inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI), which degrade the mainlobe level and raise sidelobe levels in the range-Doppler map (RDM). This paper presents a unified analytical framework to characterize the ISI and ICI caused by an insufficient CP length in multi-target scenarios. For the first time, we derive closed-form expressions for the second-order moments of the RDM under both matched filtering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) processing with insufficient CP length. These expressions quantify the effects of CP length, symbol constellation, and inter-target interference (ITI) on the mainlobe and sidelobe levels. Based on these results, we further derive explicit formulas for the peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of the RDM, revealing a fundamental trade-off between noise amplification in RF and ITI in MF. Numerical results validate our theoretical derivations and illustrate the critical impact of insufficient CP length on sensing performance in OFDM-ISAC systems.

Title: Remote Estimation over Packet-Dropping Wireless Channels with Partial State Information
Authors: Ioannis Tzortzis, Evagoras Makridis, Charalambos D. Charalambous, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper, we study the design of an optimal transmission policy for remote state estimation over packet-dropping wireless channels with imperfect channel state information. A smart sensor uses a Kalman filter to estimate the system state and transmits its information to a remote estimator. Our objective is to minimize the state estimation error and energy consumption by deciding whether to transmit new information or retransmit previously failed packets. To balance the trade-off between information freshness and reliability, the sensor applies a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol. We formulate this problem as a finite horizon partially observable Markov decision process with an augmented state-space that incorporates both the age of information and the unknown channel state. By defining an information state, we derive the dynamic programming equations for evaluating the optimal policy. This transmission policy is computed numerically using the point-based value iteration algorithm.

Title: Towards Probabilistic Dynamic Security Assessment and Enhancement of Large Power Systems
Authors: Frédéric Sabot, Pierre-Etienne Labeau, Pierre Henneaux
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel methodology for probabilistic dynamic security assessment and enhancement of power systems that considers load and generation variability, N-2 contingencies, and uncertain cascade propagation caused by uncertain protection system behaviour. In this methodology, a database of likely operating conditions is generated via weather data, a market model and a model of operators' preventive actions. System states are sampled from this database and contingencies are applied to them to perform the security assessment. Rigorous statistical indicators are proposed to decide how many biased and unbiased samples to simulate to reach a target accuracy on the statistical error on the estimated risk from individual contingencies. Optionally, a screening of contingencies can be performed to limit the computational burden of the analysis. Finally, interpretable machine learning techniques are used to identify the root causes of the risk from critical contingencies, to ease the interpretation of the results, and to help with security enhancement. The method is demonstrated on the 73-bus reliability test system, and the scalability to large power systems (with thousands of buses) is also discussed.

Title: One Target, Many Views: Multi-User Fusion for Collaborative Uplink ISAC
Authors: Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: We propose a novel pilot-free multi-user uplink framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mm-wave networks, where single-antenna users transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals without dedicated pilots. The base station exploits the spatial and velocity diversities of users to simultaneously decode messages and detect targets, transforming user transmissions into a powerful sensing tool. Each user's signal, structured by a known codebook, propagates through a sparse multi-path channel with shared moving targets and user-specific scatterers. Notably, common targets induce distinct delay-Doppler-angle signatures, while stationary scatterers cluster in parameter space. We formulate the joint multi-path parameter estimation and data decoding as a 3D super-resolution problem, extracting delays, Doppler shifts, and angles-of-arrival via atomic norm minimization, efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. A core innovation is multiuser fusion, where diverse user observations are collaboratively combined to enhance sensing and decoding. This approach improves robustness and integrates multi-user perspectives into a unified estimation framework, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable communication. Numerical results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances both target estimation and communication performance, highlighting its potential for next-generation ISAC systems.

Title: Bilateral Cognitive Security Games in Networked Control Systems under Stealthy Injection Attacks
Authors: Anh Tung Nguyen, Quanyan Zhu, André Teixeira
Abstract: This paper studies a strategic security problem in networked control systems under stealthy false data injection attacks. The security problem is modeled as a bilateral cognitive security game between a defender and an adversary, each possessing cognitive reasoning abilities. The adversary with an adversarial cognitive ability strategically attacks some interconnections of the system with the aim of disrupting the network performance while remaining stealthy to the defender. Meanwhile, the defender with a defense cognitive ability strategically monitors some nodes to impose the stealthiness constraint with the purpose of minimizing the worst-case disruption caused by the adversary. Within the proposed bilateral cognitive security framework, the preferred cognitive levels of the two strategic agents are formulated in terms of two newly proposed concepts, cognitive mismatch and cognitive resonance. Moreover, we propose a method to compute the policies for the defender and the adversary with arbitrary cognitive abilities. A sufficient condition is established under which an increase in cognitive levels does not alter the policies for the defender and the adversary, ensuring convergence. The obtained results are validated through numerical simulations.

Title: Security Metrics for Uncertain Interconnected Systems under Stealthy Data Injection Attacks
Authors: Anh Tung Nguyen, Sribalaji C. Anand, André M. H. Teixeira
Abstract: This paper quantifies the security of uncertain interconnected systems under stealthy data injection attacks. In particular, we consider a large-scale system composed of a certain subsystem interconnected with an uncertain subsystem, where only the input-output channels are accessible. An adversary is assumed to inject false data to maximize the performance loss of the certain subsystem while remaining undetected. By abstracting the uncertain subsystem as a class of admissible systems satisfying an $\mathcal{L}_2$ gain constraint, the worst-case performance loss is obtained as the solution to a convex semi-definite program depending only on the certain subsystem dynamics and such an $\mathcal{L}_2$ gain constraint. This solution is proved to serve as an upper bound for the actual worst-case performance loss when the model of the entire system is fully certain. The results are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the power transmission grid spanning Sweden and Northern Denmark.

Authors: Elena Mulero Ayllón, Massimiliano Mantegna, Linlin Shen, Paolo Soda, Valerio Guarrasi, Matteo Tortora
Abstract: Accurate lung tumor segmentation is crucial for improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes in oncology. However, the complexity of tumor morphology, size, and location poses significant challenges for automated segmentation. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of deep learning-based segmentation models, comparing traditional architectures such as U-Net and DeepLabV3, self-configuring models like nnUNet, and foundation models like MedSAM, and MedSAM~2. Evaluating performance across two lung tumor segmentation datasets, we assess segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency under various learning paradigms, including few-shot learning and fine-tuning. The results reveal that while traditional models struggle with tumor delineation, foundation models, particularly MedSAM~2, outperform them in both accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of foundation models for lung tumor segmentation, highlighting their applicability in improving clinical workflows and patient outcomes.

Title: Simultaneous Multi-Beam Radar with Full Range Resolution exploiting Space-Code Beamforming
Authors: P. Pon Surendar, K. Giridhar
Abstract: Conventional monostatic radar systems typically exhibit a trade-off between long-range target detection achieved through narrow beams and short-range wide-area surveillance employing broad beams. Realizing both functionalities within a single system, enabling simultaneous surveillance and long-range target localization, poses a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel signal model and an all-digital frequency domain radar architecture leveraging first-of-its-kind space-code beamforming technique to achieve ubiquitous radar coverage. We show that the range-angle map can be estimated for all targets at full range-resolution for all beams compared to existing subcarrier based beamforming radars.

Title: Bridging the Gap via Data-Aided Sensing: Can Bistatic ISAC Converge to Genie Performance?
Authors: Musa Furkan Keskin, Silvia Mura, Marouan Mizmizi, Dario Tagliaferri, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: We investigate data-aided iterative sensing in bistatic OFDM ISAC systems, focusing on scenarios with co-located sensing and communication receivers. To enhance target detection beyond pilot-only sensing methods, we propose a multi-stage bistatic OFDM receiver, performing iterative sensing and data demodulation to progressively refine ISAC channel and data estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data-aided scheme significantly outperforms pilot-only benchmarks, particularly in multi-target scenarios, substantially narrowing the performance gap compared to a genie-aided system with perfect data knowledge. Moreover, the proposed approach considerably expands the bistatic ISAC trade-off region, closely approaching the probability of detection-achievable rate boundary established by its genie-aided counterpart.

Title: Network-Level ISAC Design: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Opportunities
Authors: Kawon Han, Kaitao Meng, Xiao-Yang Wang, Christos Masouros
Abstract: The ultimate goal of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) deployment is to provide coordinated sensing and communication services at an unprecedented scale. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of network-level ISAC systems, an emerging paradigm that significantly extends the capabilities of link-level ISAC through distributed cooperation. We first examine recent advancements in network-level ISAC architectures, emphasizing various cooperation schemes and distributed system designs. The sensing and communication (S\&C) performance is analyzed with respect to interference management and cooperative S\&C, offering new insights into the design principles necessary for large-scale networked ISAC deployments. In addition, distributed signaling strategies across different levels of cooperation are reviewed, focusing on key performance metrics such as sensing accuracy and communication quality-of-service (QoS). Next, we explore the key challenges for practical deployment where the critical role of synchronization is also discussed, highlighting advanced over-the-air synchronization techniques specifically tailored for bi-static and distributed ISAC systems. Finally, open challenges and future research directions in network-level ISAC design are identified. The findings and discussions aim to serve as a foundational guideline for advancing scalable, high-performance, and resilient distributed ISAC systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Title: Contactless pulse rate assessment: Results and insights for application in driving simulator
Authors: Đorđe D. Nešković, Kristina Stojmenova Pečečnik, Jaka Sodnik, Nadica Miljković
Abstract: Camera-based monitoring of Pulse Rate (PR) enables continuous and unobtrusive assessment of driver's state, allowing estimation of fatigue or stress that could impact traffic safety. Commonly used wearable Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, while effective, suffer from motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of non-contact PR assessment using facial video recordings captured by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulation environment. The proposed approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable wristband Empatica E4. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on signal quality and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and signal extraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that EVM slightly improves PR estimation accuracy, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm and RMSE from 7.84 bpm to 6.38 bpm. A statistically significant difference is found between older and younger groups with both video-based and ground truth evaluation procedures. Additionally, we discuss Empatica E4 bias and its potential impact on the overall assessment of contact measurements. Altogether the findings demonstrate the feasibility of camera-based PR monitoring in dynamic environments and its potential integration into driving simulators for real-time physiological assessment.

Title: Electronic Nose for Agricultural Grain Pest Detection, Identification, and Monitoring: A Review
Authors: Chetan M Badgujar, Sai Swaminathan, Alison Gerken
Abstract: Biotic pest attacks and infestations are major causes of stored grain losses, leading to significant food and economic losses. Conventional, manual, sampling-based pest recognition methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, costly, require expertise, and may not even detect hidden infestations. In recent years, the electronic nose (e-nose) approach has emerged as a potential alternative for agricultural grain pest recognition and monitoring. An e-nose mimics human olfactory systems by integrating a sensor array, data acquisition, and analysis for recognizing grain pests by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by grain and pests. However, well-documented, curated, and synthesized literature on the use of e-nose technology for grain pest detection is lacking. Therefore, this systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art e-nose technology for agricultural grain pest monitoring. The review examines employed sensor technology, targeted pest species type, grain medium, data processing, and pattern recognition techniques. An e-nose is a promising tool that offers a rapid, low-cost, non-destructive solution for detecting, identifying, and monitoring grain pests, including microscopic and hidden insects, with good accuracy. We identified the factors that influence the e-nose performance, which include pest species, storage duration, temperature, moisture content, and pest density. The major challenges include sensor array optimization or selection, large data processing, poor repeatability, and comparability among measurements. An inexpensive and portable e-nose has the potential to help stakeholders and storage managers take timely and data-driven informed actions or decisions to reduce overall food and economic losses.

Title: Pattern formation using an intrinsic optimal control approach
Authors: Tianhao Li, Yibei Li, Zhixin Liu, Xiaoming Hu
Abstract: This paper investigates a pattern formation control problem for a multi-agent system modeled with given interaction topology, in which $m$ of the $n$ agents are chosen as leaders and consequently a control signal is added to each of the leaders. These agents interact with each other by Laplacian dynamics on a graph. The pattern formation control problem is formulated as an intrinsic infinite time-horizon linear quadratic optimal control problem, namely, no error information is incorporated in the objective function. Under mild conditions, we show the existence of the optimal control strategy and the convergence to the desired pattern formation. Based on the optimal control strategy, we propose a distributed control strategy to achieve the given pattern. Finally, numerical simulation is given to illustrate theoretical results.

Title: Power System Transition Planning: An Industry-Aligned Framework for Long-Term Optimization
Authors: Ahmed Al-Shafei, Nima Amjady, Hamidreza Zareipour, Yankai Cao
Abstract: This work introduces the category of Power System Transition Planning optimization problem. It aims to shift power systems to emissions-free networks efficiently. Unlike comparable work, the framework presented here broadly applies to the industry's decision-making process. It defines a field-appropriate functional boundary focused on the economic efficiency of power systems. Namely, while imposing a wide range of planning factors in the decision space, the model maintains the structure and depth of conventional power system planning under uncertainty, which leads to a large-scale multistage stochastic programming formulation that encounters intractability in real-life cases. Thus, the framework simultaneously invokes high-performance computing defaultism. In this comprehensive exposition, we present a guideline model, comparing its scope to existing formulations, supported by a fully detailed example problem, showcasing the analytical value of the solution gained in a small test case. Then, the framework's viability for realistic applications is demonstrated by solving an extensive test case based on a realistic planning construct consistent with Alberta's power system practices for long-term planning studies. The framework resorts to Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming as a decomposition method to achieve tractability, leveraging High-Performance Computing and parallel computation.

Title: Cramér-Rao Bounds for Integrated Sensing and Communications in Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Dimitrios Bozanis, Vasilis K. Papanikolaou, Sotiris A. Tegos, George K. Karagiannidis
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently emerged as a flexible, cost-effective route to large-scale antenna deployments envisioned for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper establishes the fundamental sensing limits of a bistatic PAS link by deriving closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bounds for the joint estimation of range and direction when a target is illuminated by pinching antennas placed along a dielectric waveguide and observed by a uniform linear array receiver. By rigorously preserving the amplitude and phase variations of each pinching antenna, as well as exploiting their non-uniform deployment, we gain valuable insights into the performance gain of PASs over conventional antenna arrays. Numerical results validate that the PAS-based ISAC can achieve centimeter-level ranging and sub-degree angular resolution with significantly fewer hardware resources than conventional uniform linear arrays. The derived bounds provide practical design guidelines for next-generation PAS-enabled ISAC systems.

Title: How much to Dereverberate? Low-Latency Single-Channel Speech Enhancement in Distant Microphone Scenarios
Authors: Satvik Venkatesh, Philip Coleman, Arthur Benilov, Simon Brown, Selim Sheta, Frederic Roskam
Abstract: Dereverberation is an important sub-task of Speech Enhancement (SE) to improve the signal's intelligibility and quality. However, it remains challenging because the reverberation is highly correlated with the signal. Furthermore, the single-channel SE literature has predominantly focused on rooms with short reverb times (typically under 1 second), smaller rooms (under volumes of 1000 cubic meters) and relatively short distances (up to 2 meters). In this paper, we explore real-time low-latency single-channel SE under distant microphone scenarios, such as 5 to 10 meters, and focus on conference rooms and theatres, with larger room dimensions and reverberation times. Such a setup is useful for applications such as lecture demonstrations, drama, and to enhance stage acoustics. First, we show that single-channel SE in such challenging scenarios is feasible. Second, we investigate the relationship between room volume and reverberation time, and demonstrate its importance when randomly simulating room impulse responses. Lastly, we show that for dereverberation with short decay times, preserving early reflections before decaying the transfer function of the room improves overall signal quality.

Title: Deep Learning-Enabled System Diagnosis in Microgrids: A Feature-Feedback GAN Approach
Authors: Swetha Rani Kasimalla, Kuchan Park, Junho Hong, Young-Jin Kim, HyoJong Lee
Abstract: The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and communication networks has brought both modernization and new vulnerabilities to the power system infrastructure. These vulnerabilities expose the system to internal faults and cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, which can closely mimic real fault scenarios. Hence, this work presents a two-stage fault and cyberattack detection framework tailored for inverter-based microgrids. Stage 1 introduces an unsupervised learning model Feature Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN), to distinguish between genuine internal faults and cyber-induced anomalies in microgrids. Compared to conventional GAN architectures, F2GAN demonstrates improved system diagnosis and greater adaptability to zero-day attacks through its feature-feedback mechanism. In Stage 2, supervised machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to localize and classify faults within inverter switches, distinguishing between single-switch and multi-switch faults. The proposed framework is validated on a simulated microgrid environment, illustrating robust performance in detecting and classifying both physical and cyber-related disturbances in power electronic-dominated systems.

Title: Potential Contrast: Properties, Equivalences, and Generalization to Multiple Classes
Authors: Wallace Peaslee, Anna Breger, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb
Abstract: Potential contrast is typically used as an image quality measure and quantifies the maximal possible contrast between samples from two classes of pixels in an image after an arbitrary grayscale transformation. It has been valuable in cultural heritage applications, identifying and visualizing relevant information in multispectral images while requiring a small number of pixels to be manually sampled. In this work, we introduce a normalized version of potential contrast that removes dependence on image format and also prove equalities that enable generalization to more than two classes and to continuous settings. Finally, we exemplify the utility of multi-class normalized potential contrast through an application to a medieval music manuscript with visible bleedthrough from the back page. We share our implementations, based on both original algorithms and our new equalities, including generalization to multiple classes, at this https URL.

Title: Unconstrained Large-scale 3D Reconstruction and Rendering across Altitudes
Authors: Neil Joshi, Joshua Carney, Nathanael Kuo, Homer Li, Cheng Peng, Myron Brown
Abstract: Production of photorealistic, navigable 3D site models requires a large volume of carefully collected images that are often unavailable to first responders for disaster relief or law enforcement. Real-world challenges include limited numbers of images, heterogeneous unposed cameras, inconsistent lighting, and extreme viewpoint differences for images collected from varying altitudes. To promote research aimed at addressing these challenges, we have developed the first public benchmark dataset for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis based on multiple calibrated ground-level, security-level, and airborne cameras. We present datasets that pose real-world challenges, independently evaluate calibration of unposed cameras and quality of novel rendered views, demonstrate baseline performance using recent state-of-practice methods, and identify challenges for further research.

Title: MoSAM: Motion-Guided Segment Anything Model with Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection
Authors: Qiushi Yang, Yuan Yao, Miaomiao Cui, Liefeng Bo
Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in interactive object segmentation for both images and videos. However, as a foundational model on interactive segmentation, SAM2 performs segmentation directly based on mask memory from the past six frames, leading to two significant challenges. Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may disappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object motion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities. Secondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it susceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion, due to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these problems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate object motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory. Firstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object motion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a set of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards the direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities. Furthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we devise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically identifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and frame-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from memory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar regions for improving segmentation results. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of video object segmentation and video instance segmentation demonstrate that our MoSAM achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other competitors.

Title: Zoomer: Adaptive Image Focus Optimization for Black-box MLLM
Authors: Jiaxu Qian, Chendong Wang, Yifan Yang, Chaoyun Zhang, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Anlan Zhang, Shiqi Jiang, Ting Cao, Tianjun Mao, Suman Banerjee, Guyue Liu, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Qi Zhang, Lili Qiu
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have broadened the scope of vision-language tasks, excelling in applications like image captioning and interactive question-answering. However, these models struggle with accurately processing visual data, particularly in tasks requiring precise object recognition and fine visual details. Stringent token limits often result in the omission of critical information, hampering performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \SysName, a novel visual prompting mechanism designed to enhance MLLM performance while preserving essential visual details within token limits. \SysName features three key innovations: a prompt-aware strategy that dynamically highlights relevant image regions, a spatial-preserving orchestration schema that maintains object integrity, and a budget-aware prompting method that balances global context with crucial visual details. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that \SysName consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a $26.9\%$ improvement in accuracy while significantly reducing token consumption.

Title: Uncertainty-aware Latent Safety Filters for Avoiding Out-of-Distribution Failures
Authors: Junwon Seo, Kensuke Nakamura, Andrea Bajcsy
Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.

Title: Advancing Wheat Crop Analysis: A Survey of Deep Learning Approaches Using Hyperspectral Imaging
Authors: Fadi Abdeladhim Zidi, Abdelkrim Ouafi, Fares Bougourzi, Cosimo Distante, Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed
Abstract: As one of the most widely cultivated and consumed crops, wheat is essential to global food security. However, wheat production is increasingly challenged by pests, diseases, climate change, and water scarcity, threatening yields. Traditional crop monitoring methods are labor-intensive and often ineffective for early issue detection. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a non-destructive and efficient technology for remote crop health assessment. However, the high dimensionality of HSI data and limited availability of labeled samples present notable challenges. In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in addressing these challenges due to its ability to extract and analysis complex structures. Despite advancements in applying deep learning methods to HSI data for wheat crop analysis, no comprehensive survey currently exists in this field. This review addresses this gap by summarizing benchmark datasets, tracking advancements in deep learning methods, and analyzing key applications such as variety classification, disease detection, and yield estimation. It also highlights the strengths, limitations, and future opportunities in leveraging deep learning methods for HSI-based wheat crop analysis. We have listed the current state-of-the-art papers and will continue tracking updating them in the following this https URL.

Title: Dual Filter: A Mathematical Framework for Inference using Transformer-like Architectures
Authors: Heng-Sheng Chang, Prashant G. Mehta
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). Both the problem formulation and the proposed solution are motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture, in which a finite sequence of observations (tokens) is mapped to the conditional probability of the next token. Our objective is not to construct a mathematical model of a transformer. Rather, our interest lies in deriving, from first principles, transformer-like architectures that solve the prediction problem for which the transformer is designed. The proposed framework is based on an original optimal control approach, where the prediction objective (MMSE) is reformulated as an optimal control problem. An analysis of the optimal control problem is presented leading to a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. To solve the fixed-point equation, we introduce the dual filter, an iterative algorithm that closely parallels the architecture of decoder-only transformers. These parallels are discussed in detail along with the relationship to prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers as transport on the space of probability measures. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm using parameter values used in researchscale transformer models.

Title: Near-optimal Sensor Placement for Detecting Stochastic Target Trajectories in Barrier Coverage Systems
Authors: Mingyu Kim, Daniel J. Stilwell, Harun Yetkin, Jorge Jimenez
Abstract: This paper addresses the deployment of sensors for a 2-D barrier coverage system. The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.

Title: SMSAT: A Multimodal Acoustic Dataset and Deep Contrastive Learning Framework for Affective and Physiological Modeling of Spiritual Meditation
Authors: Ahmad Suleman, Yazeed Alkhrijah, Misha Urooj Khan, Hareem Khan, Muhammad Abdullah Husnain Ali Faiz, Mohamad A. Alawad, Zeeshan Kaleem, Guan Gui
Abstract: Understanding how auditory stimuli influence emotional and physiological states is fundamental to advancing affective computing and mental health technologies. In this paper, we present a multimodal evaluation of the affective and physiological impacts of three auditory conditions, that is, spiritual meditation (SM), music (M), and natural silence (NS), using a comprehensive suite of biometric signal measures. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce the Spiritual, Music, Silence Acoustic Time Series (SMSAT) dataset, a novel benchmark comprising acoustic time series (ATS) signals recorded under controlled exposure protocols, with careful attention to demographic diversity and experimental consistency. To model the auditory induced states, we develop a contrastive learning based SMSAT audio encoder that extracts highly discriminative embeddings from ATS data, achieving 99.99% classification accuracy in interclass and intraclass evaluations. Furthermore, we propose the Calmness Analysis Model (CAM), a deep learning framework integrating 25 handcrafted and learned features for affective state classification across auditory conditions, attaining robust 99.99% classification accuracy. In contrast, pairwise t tests reveal significant deviations in cardiac response characteristics (CRC) between SM analysis via ANOVA inducing more significant physiological fluctuations. Compared to existing state of the art methods reporting accuracies up to 90%, the proposed model demonstrates substantial performance gains (up to 99%). This work contributes a validated multimodal dataset and a scalable deep learning framework for affective computing applications in stress monitoring, mental well-being, and therapeutic audio-based interventions.

Title: Fault-Tolerant Multi-Modal Localization of Multi-Robots on Matrix Lie Groups
Authors: Mahboubeh Zarei, Robin Chhabra
Abstract: Consistent localization of cooperative multi-robot systems during navigation presents substantial challenges. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant, multi-modal localization framework for multi-robot systems on matrix Lie groups. We introduce novel stochastic operations to perform composition, differencing, inversion, averaging, and fusion of correlated and non-correlated estimates on Lie groups, enabling pseudo-pose construction for filter updates. The method integrates a combination of proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements from inertial, velocity, and pose (pseudo-pose) sensors on each robot in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework. The prediction step is conducted on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}_2(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$, where each robot's pose, velocity, and inertial measurement biases are propagated. The proposed framework uses body velocity, relative pose measurements from fiducial markers, and inter-robot communication to provide scalable EKF update across the network on the Lie group $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3$. A fault detection module is implemented, allowing the integration of only reliable pseudo-pose measurements from fiducial markers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through experiments with a network of wheeled mobile robots equipped with inertial measurement units, wheel odometry, and ArUco markers. The comparison results highlight the proposed method's real-time performance, superior efficiency, reliability, and scalability in multi-robot localization, making it well-suited for large-scale robotic systems.

Title: Platoon Coordination and Leader Selection in Mixed Transportation Systems via Dynamic Programming
Authors: Ying Wang, Ting Bai, Andreas A. Malikopoulos
Abstract: With the growing penetration of electric trucks, freight transportation is transitioning toward a mixed system comprising both fuel-powered and electric trucks. Enhancing truck platoon formation in such a heterogeneous environment presents new challenges. This paper investigates the hub-based platoon coordination problem in a mixed truck fleet, where the focus is to optimize the trucks' waiting times, charging amounts for electric trucks, and platoon leader assignments. The objective is to maximize the overall platoon revenue of the fleet while accounting for the associated waiting and charging costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and present a dynamic programming approach to compute its sub-optimal solution efficiently. The proposed method operates in polynomial time, ensuring scalable computational efficiency. Simulation studies involving 1,000 trucks traveling between two hubs in Sweden demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.

Title: SeLR: Sparsity-enhanced Lagrangian Relaxation for Computation Offloading at the Edge
Authors: Negar Erfaniantaghvayi, Zhongyuan Zhao, Kevin Chan, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computational approach for offloading sensor data processing tasks to servers in edge networks for better accuracy and makespan. A task is assigned with one of several offloading options, each comprises a server, a route for uploading data to the server, and a service profile that specifies the performance and resource consumption at the server and in the network. This offline offloading and routing problem is formulated as mixed integer programming (MIP), which is non-convex and HP-hard due to the discrete decision variables associated to the offloading options. The novelty of our approach is to transform this non-convex problem into iterative convex optimization by relaxing integer decision variables into continuous space, combining primal-dual optimization for penalizing constraint violations and reweighted $L_1$-minimization for promoting solution sparsity, which achieves better convergence through a smoother path in a continuous search space. Compared to existing greedy heuristics, our approach can achieve a better Pareto frontier in accuracy and latency, scales better to larger problem instances, and can achieve a 7.72--9.17$\times$ reduction in computational overhead of scheduling compared to the optimal solver in hierarchically organized edge networks with 300 nodes and 50--100 tasks.

Title: Deep Autoencoder-Based Constellation Design in Multiple Access Channels
Authors: Stepan Gorelenkov, Mojtaba Vaezi
Abstract: In multiple access channels (MAC), multiple users share a transmission medium to communicate with a common receiver. Traditional constellations like quadrature amplitude modulation are optimized for point-to-point systems and lack mechanisms to mitigate inter-user interference, leading to suboptimal performance in MAC environments. To address this, we propose a novel framework for constellation design in MAC that employs deep autoencoder (DAE)-based communication systems. This approach intelligently creates flexible constellations aware of inter-user interference, reducing symbol error rate and enhancing the constellation-constrained sum capacity of the channel. Comparisons against analytically derived constellations demonstrate that DAE-designed constellations consistently perform best or equal to the best across various system parameters. Furthermore, we apply the DAE to scenarios where no analytical solutions have been developed, such as with more than two users, demonstrating the adaptability of the model.

Title: Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Offline Data with Conservatism
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Hussein Sibai
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by proposing an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets. Our algorithm trains the filter to not only prevent the system from reaching unsafe states but also out-of-distribution ones, at which the filter would be unreliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety and out-of-distribution avoidance while minimally affecting task performance.

Title: A Self-Supervised Transformer for Unusable Shared Bike Detection
Authors: Yin Huang, Yongqi Dong, Youhua Tang, Alvaro García Hernandez
Abstract: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.

Title: DexCtrl: Towards Sim-to-Real Dexterity with Adaptive Controller Learning
Authors: Shuqi Zhao, Ke Yang, Yuxin Chen, Chenran Li, Yichen Xie, Xiang Zhang, Changhao Wang, Masayoshi Tomizuka
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with policies capable of executing many complex and contact-rich tasks in simulation. However, transferring these policies from simulation to real world remains a significant challenge. One important issue is the mismatch in low-level controller dynamics, where identical trajectories can lead to vastly different contact forces and behaviors when control parameters vary. Existing approaches often rely on manual tuning or controller randomization, which can be labor-intensive, task-specific, and introduce significant training difficulty. In this work, we propose a framework that jointly learns actions and controller parameters based on the historical information of both trajectory and controller. This adaptive controller adjustment mechanism allows the policy to automatically tune control parameters during execution, thereby mitigating the sim-to-real gap without extensive manual tuning or excessive randomization. Moreover, by explicitly providing controller parameters as part of the observation, our approach facilitates better reasoning over force interactions and improves robustness in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves improved transfer performance across a variety of dexterous tasks involving variable force conditions.

Title: Model Tensor Planning
Authors: An T. Le, Khai Nguyen, Minh Nhat Vu, João Carvalho, Jan Peters
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width. Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.

Title: Quasi-Static IRS: 3D Shaped Beamforming for Area Coverage Enhancement
Authors: Zhenyu Jiang, Xintong Chen, Jiangbin Lyu, Liqun Fu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising paradigm to reconfigure the wireless environment for enhanced communication coverage and quality. However, to compensate for the double pathloss effect, massive IRS elements are required, raising concerns on the scalability of cost and complexity. This paper introduces a new architecture of quasi-static IRS (QS-IRS), which tunes element phases via mechanical adjustment or manually re-arranging the array topology. QS-IRS relies on massive production/assembly of purely passive elements only, and thus is suitable for ultra low-cost and large-scale deployment to enhance long-term coverage. To achieve this end, an IRS-aided area coverage problem is formulated, which explicitly considers the element radiation pattern (ERP), with the newly introduced shape masks for the mainlobe, and the sidelobe constraints to reduce energy leakage. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the difference-of-convex (DC) and successive convex approximation (SCA) procedure is proposed, which achieves shaped beamforming with power gains close to that of the joint optimization algorithm, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.

Title: Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backwards SDEs
Authors: Sungje Park, Stephen Tu
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.

Title: Improving Editability in Image Generation with Layer-wise Memory
Authors: Daneul Kim, Jaeah Lee, Jaesik Park
Abstract: Most real-world image editing tasks require multiple sequential edits to achieve desired results. Current editing approaches, primarily designed for single-object modifications, struggle with sequential editing: especially with maintaining previous edits along with adapting new objects naturally into the existing content. These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory, which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method, we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance in iterative image editing tasks with minimal user effort, requiring only rough masks while maintaining high-quality results throughout multiple editing steps.

Title: Realizing Fully-Connected Layers Over the Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Meng Hua, Chenghong Bian, Haotian Wu, Deniz Gündüz
Abstract: By leveraging the waveform superposition property of the multiple access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables the execution of digital computations through analog means in the wireless domain, leading to faster processing and reduced latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implement a neural network (NN) consisting of digital fully connected (FC) layers using physically reconfigurable hardware. Specifically, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to emulate the functionality of a NN for over-the-air inference. In this setup, both the RIS and the transceiver are jointly configured to manipulate the ambient wireless propagation environment, effectively reproducing the adjustable weights of a digital FC layer. We refer to this new computational paradigm as \textit{AirFC}. We formulate an imitation error minimization problem between the effective channel created by RIS and a target FC layer by jointly optimizing over-the-air parameters. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an extremely low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted MIMO-based AirFC can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is also shown that a multi-RIS configuration significantly outperforms a single-RIS setup, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated channels.

Title: EnviKal-Loc: Sub-10m Indoor LoRaWAN Localization using an Environmental-Aware Path Loss and Adaptive RSSI Smoothing
Authors: Nahshon Mokua Obiri, Kristof Van Laerhoven
Abstract: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.

Title: Secure Cluster-Based Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks
Authors: M. Saeid HaghighiFard, Sinem Coleri
Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.

Title: Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Near-Field Holographic MIMO over Ricean Fading Channels
Authors: Mengyu Qian, Xidong Mu, Li You, Hyundong Shin, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: With the denser distribution of antenna elements, stronger mutual coupling effects would kick in among antenna elements, which would eventually affect the communication performance. Meanwhile, as the holographic array usually has large physical size, the possibility of near-field communication increases. This paper investigates a near-field multi-user downlink HMIMO system and characterizes the spectral efficiency (SE) under the mutual coupling effect over Ricean fading channels. Both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios are considered. (i) For the perfect CSI case, the mutual coupling and radiation efficiency model are first established. Then, the closed-form SE is derived under maximum ratio transmission (MRT). By comparing the SE between the cases with and without mutual coupling, it is unveiled that the system SE with mutual coupling might outperform that without mutual coupling in the low transmit power regime for a given aperture size. Moreover, it is also unveiled that the inter-user interference cannot be eliminated unless the physical size of the array increases to infinity. Fortunately, the additional distance term in the near-field channel can be exploited for the inter-user interference mitigation, especially for the worst case, where the users' angular positions overlap to a great extent. (ii) For the imperfect CSI case, the channel estimation error is considered for the derivation of the closed-form SE under MRT. It shows that in the low transmit power regime, the system SE can be enhanced by increasing the pilot power and the antenna element density, the latter of which will lead to severe mutual coupling. In the high transmit power regime, increasing the pilot power has a limited effect on improving the system SE. However, increasing the antenna element density remains highly beneficial for enhancing the system SE.

Title: Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Multi-Group Multicast Communications
Authors: Mengyu Qian, Xidong Mu, Li You, Michail Matthaiou
Abstract: A continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-group multicast communication system is investigated. An integral-based CAPA multi-group multicast beamforming design is formulated for the maximization of the system energy efficiency (EE), subject to a minimum multicast SE constraint of each user group and a total transmit power constraint. To address this non-econvex fractional programming problem, the Dinkelbach's method is employed. Within the Dinkelbach's framework, the non-convex group-wise multicast spectral efficiency (SE) constraint is first equivalently transformed into a tractable form with auxiliary variables. Then, an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm is developed to solve the reformulated problem. The CAPA beamforming design subproblem can be optimally solved via the Lagrangian dual method and the calculus of variations (CoV) theory. It reveals that the optimal CAPA beamformer should be a combination of all the groups' user channels. To further reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based approach is proposed. The closed-form ZF CAPA beamformer is derived using each group's most representative user channel to mitigate the inter-group interference while ensuring the intra-group multicast performance. Then, the beamforming design subproblem in the BCD-based algorithm becomes a convex power allocation subproblem, which can be efficiently solved. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the CAPA can significantly improve the EE compared to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs); 2) due to the enhanced spatial resolutions, increasing the aperture size of CAPA is not always beneficial for EE enhancement in multicast scenarios; and 3) wider user distributions of each group cause a significant EE degradation of CAPA compared to SPDA.

Title: Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models
Authors: Shunpu Tang, Yuanyuan Jia, Qianqian Yang, Ruichen Zhang, Jihong Park, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.

Title: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis with Single Exposure
Authors: Kaixuan Zhang, Hu Wang, Minxian Li, Mingwu Ren, Mao Ye, Xiatian Zhu
Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR-NVS) aims to establish a 3D scene HDR model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) imagery. Typically, multiple-exposure LDR images are employed to capture a wider range of brightness levels in a scene, as a single LDR image cannot represent both the brightest and darkest regions simultaneously. While effective, this multiple-exposure HDR-NVS approach has significant limitations, including susceptibility to motion artifacts (e.g., ghosting and blurring), high capture and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the single-exposure HDR-NVS problem, where only single exposure LDR images are available during training. We further introduce a novel approach, Mono-HDR-3D, featuring two dedicated modules formulated by the LDR image formation principles, one for converting LDR colors to HDR counterparts, and the other for transforming HDR images to LDR format so that unsupervised learning is enabled in a closed loop. Designed as a meta-algorithm, our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing NVS models. Extensive experiments show that Mono-HDR-3D significantly outperforms previous methods. Source code will be released.

Title: Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO in Realistic Urban Propagation Environments
Authors: Yunlu Xiao, Ljiljana Simić
Abstract: While UE-centric cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides high and uniform throughput performance under the assumption of a uniform propagation environment modeled by the log-distance path loss channel model, the performance under a realistic urban propagation environment is not yet fully addressed. In this paper we conduct the first comparative performance study of CF-mMIMO under both the widely assumed log-distance channel model and the realistic urban propagation environment obtained via raytracing using real 3D city layouts and practical AP locations. Our results show that with the raytracing channel model, CF-mMIMO cannot achieve as high and uniform throughput performance as observed with the log-distance channel model, putting into question the attractiveness in practice of CF-mMIMO for real urban deployments.

Title: RD-UIE: Relation-Driven State Space Modeling for Underwater Image Enhancement
Authors: Kui Jiang, Yan Luo, Junjun Jiang, Xin Xu, Fei Ma, Fei Yu
Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a critical preprocessing step for marine vision applications, where wavelength-dependent attenuation causes severe content degradation and color distortion. While recent state space models like Mamba show potential for long-range dependency modeling, their unfolding operations and fixed scan paths on 1D sequences fail to adapt to local object semantics and global relation modeling, limiting their efficacy in complex underwater environments. To address this, we enhance conventional Mamba with the sorting-based scanning mechanism that dynamically reorders scanning sequences based on statistical distribution of spatial correlation of all pixels. In this way, it encourages the network to prioritize the most informative components--structural and semantic features. Upon building this mechanism, we devise a Visually Self-adaptive State Block (VSSB) that harmonizes dynamic sorting of Mamba with input-dependent dynamic convolution, enabling coherent integration of global context and local relational cues. This exquisite design helps eliminate global focus bias, especially for widely distributed contents, which greatly weakens the statistical frequency. For robust feature extraction and refinement, we design a cross-feature bridge (CFB) to adaptively fuse multi-scale representations. These efforts compose the novel relation-driven Mamba framework for effective UIE (RD-UIE). Extensive experiments on underwater enhancement benchmarks demonstrate RD-UIE outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WMamba in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity, averagely achieving 0.55 dB performance gain on the three benchmarks.

Title: Higher-Order Spectra and their Unbiased Estimation in the GPU-accelerated SignalSnap Library
Authors: Markus Sifft, Armin Ghorbanietemad, Fabian Wagner, Daniel Hägele
Abstract: The analysis of time-dependent data poses a fundamental challenge in many fields of science and engineering. While concepts for higher-order spectral analysis like Brillinger's polyspectra for stationary processes have long been introduced, their applications have been limited probably due to high computational cost and complexity of implementation. Here we discuss the theoretical background of estimating polyspectra with our open-source GPU-accelerated SignaSnap library and highlight its advantages over previous implementations: (i) The calculation of spectra is unprecedentedly based on unbiased and consistent estimators that suppress the appearance of false structures in fourth-order spectra. (ii) SignalSnap implements cross-correlation spectra for up to four channels. (iii) The spectral estimates of SignalSnap have a clear relation to Brillinger's definition of ideal spectra of continuous stochastic processes in terms of amplitude and spectral resolution. (iv) SignalSnap estimates the variance of each spectral value. We show how polyspectra reveal, e.g., the correlations between different channels or the breaking of time-inversion symmetry and discuss how quasi-polyspectra uncover the non-stationarity of signals.

Authors: Fenghao Zhu, Xinquan Wang, Chen Zhu, Tierui Gong, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Xiaoming Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative technology with immense potential to reshape the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication network. By utilizing advanced algorithms for feature extraction and pattern recognition, DL provides unprecedented capabilities in optimizing the network efficiency and performance, particularly in physical layer communications. Although DL technologies present the great potential, they also face significant challenges related to the robustness, which are expected to intensify in the complex and demanding 6G environment. Specifically, current DL models typically exhibit substantial performance degradation in dynamic environments with time-varying channels, interference of noise and different scenarios, which affect their effectiveness in diverse real-world applications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of strategies and approaches for robust DL-based methods in physical layer communications. First we introduce the key challenges that current DL models face. Then we delve into a detailed examination of DL approaches specifically tailored to enhance robustness in 6G, which are classified into data-driven and model-driven strategies. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of these methods by case studies and outline future research directions.

Title: CAV-MAE Sync: Improving Contrastive Audio-Visual Mask Autoencoders via Fine-Grained Alignment
Authors: Edson Araujo, Andrew Rouditchenko, Yuan Gong, Saurabhchand Bhati, Samuel Thomas, Brian Kingsbury, Leonid Karlinsky, Rogerio Feris, James R. Glass
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-visual learning have shown promising results in learning representations across modalities. However, most approaches rely on global audio representations that fail to capture fine-grained temporal correspondences with visual frames. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with conflicting optimization objectives when trying to jointly learn reconstruction and cross-modal alignment. In this work, we propose CAV-MAE Sync as a simple yet effective extension of the original CAV-MAE framework for self-supervised audio-visual learning. We address three key challenges: First, we tackle the granularity mismatch between modalities by treating audio as a temporal sequence aligned with video frames, rather than using global representations. Second, we resolve conflicting optimization goals by separating contrastive and reconstruction objectives through dedicated global tokens. Third, we improve spatial localization by introducing learnable register tokens that reduce semantic load on patch tokens. We evaluate the proposed approach on AudioSet, VGG Sound, and the ADE20K Sound dataset on zero-shot retrieval, classification and localization tasks demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming more complex architectures.

Title: FlowDubber: Movie Dubbing with LLM-based Semantic-aware Learning and Flow Matching based Voice Enhancing
Authors: Gaoxiang Cong, Liang Li, Jiadong Pan, Zhedong Zhang, Amin Beheshti, Anton van den Hengel, Yuankai Qi, Qingming Huang
Abstract: Movie Dubbing aims to convert scripts into speeches that align with the given movie clip in both temporal and emotional aspects while preserving the vocal timbre of a given brief reference audio. Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks.

Title: Integration of Multi-Mode Preference into Home Energy Management System Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Mohammed Sumayli, Olugbenga Moses Anubi
Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.

Title: Binamix -- A Python Library for Generating Binaural Audio Datasets
Authors: Dan Barry, Davoud Shariat Panah, Alessandro Ragano, Jan Skoglund, Andrew Hines
Abstract: The increasing demand for spatial audio in applications such as virtual reality, immersive media, and spatial audio research necessitates robust solutions to generate binaural audio data sets for use in testing and validation. Binamix is an open-source Python library designed to facilitate programmatic binaural mixing using the extensive SADIE II Database, which provides Head Related Impulse Response (HRIR) and Binaural Room Impulse Response (BRIR) data for 20 subjects. The Binamix library provides a flexible and repeatable framework for creating large-scale spatial audio datasets, making it an invaluable resource for codec evaluation, audio quality metric development, and machine learning model training. A range of pre-built example scripts, utility functions, and visualization plots further streamline the process of custom pipeline creation. This paper presents an overview of the library's capabilities, including binaural rendering, impulse response interpolation, and multi-track mixing for various speaker layouts. The tools utilize a modified Delaunay triangulation technique to achieve accurate HRIR/BRIR interpolation where desired angles are not present in the data. By supporting a wide range of parameters such as azimuth, elevation, subject Impulse Responses (IRs), speaker layouts, mixing controls, and more, the library enables researchers to create large binaural datasets for any downstream purpose. Binamix empowers researchers and developers to advance spatial audio applications with reproducible methodologies by offering an open-source solution for binaural rendering and dataset generation. We release the library under the Apache 2.0 License at this https URL

Title: An Efficient Real-Time Planning Method for Swarm Robotics Based on an Optimal Virtual Tube
Authors: Pengda Mao, Shuli Lv, Chen Min, Zhaolong Shen, Quan Quan
Abstract: Swarm robotics navigating through unknown obstacle environments is an emerging research area that faces challenges. Performing tasks in such environments requires swarms to achieve autonomous localization, perception, decision-making, control, and planning. The limited computational resources of onboard platforms present significant challenges for planning and control. Reactive planners offer low computational demands and high re-planning frequencies but lack predictive capabilities, often resulting in local minima. Long-horizon planners, on the other hand, can perform multi-step predictions to reduce deadlocks but cost much computation, leading to lower re-planning frequencies. This paper proposes a real-time optimal virtual tube planning method for swarm robotics in unknown environments, which generates approximate solutions for optimal trajectories through affine functions. As a result, the computational complexity of approximate solutions is $O(n_t)$, where $n_t$ is the number of parameters in the trajectory, thereby significantly reducing the overall computational burden. By integrating reactive methods, the proposed method enables low-computation, safe swarm motion in unknown environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several simulations and experiments.

Title: Timely Tracking of a Wiener Process With Single Bit Quantization
Authors: Osmail Cosandal, Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider the problem of timely tracking of a Wiener process via an energy-conserving sensor by utilizing a single bit quantization strategy under periodic sampling. Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only utilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an additional `$\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \emph{not transmitting}. Thus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as opposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum quantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by tracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method requires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for energy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity methods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions are available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based on the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we calculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization error can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a constant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe that all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and transmission cost.

Title: Volumetric medical image segmentation through dual self-distillation in U-shaped networks
Authors: Soumyanil Banerjee, Nicholas Summerfield, Ming Dong, Carri Glide-Hurst
Abstract: U-shaped networks and its variants have demonstrated exceptional results for medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel dual self-distillation (DSD) framework in U-shaped networks for volumetric medical image segmentation. DSD distills knowledge from the ground-truth segmentation labels to the decoder layers. Additionally, DSD also distills knowledge from the deepest decoder and encoder layer to the shallower decoder and encoder layers respectively of a single U-shaped network. DSD is a general training strategy that could be attached to the backbone architecture of any U-shaped network to further improve its segmentation performance. We attached DSD on several state-of-the-art U-shaped backbones, and extensive experiments on various public 3D medical image segmentation datasets (cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus) demonstrated significant improvement over the same backbones without DSD. On average, after attaching DSD to the U-shaped backbones, we observed an increase of 2.82\%, 4.53\% and 1.3\% in Dice similarity score, a decrease of 7.15 mm, 6.48 mm and 0.76 mm in the Hausdorff distance, for cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus segmentation, respectively. These improvements were achieved with negligible increase in the number of trainable parameters and training time. Our proposed DSD framework also led to significant qualitative improvements for cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus segmentation over the U-shaped backbones.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Bayes' Rule and Its Applications
Authors: Shixiong Wang
Abstract: Bayes' rule has enabled innumerable powerful algorithms of statistical signal processing and statistical machine learning. However, when model misspecifications exist in prior and/or data distributions, the direct application of Bayes' rule is questionable. Philosophically, the key is to balance the relative importance between prior and data distributions when calculating posterior distributions: if prior distributions are overly conservative (i.e., exceedingly spread), we upweight the prior belief; if prior distributions are overly opportunistic (i.e., exceedingly concentrated), we downweight the prior belief. The same operation also applies to data distributions. This paper studies a generalized Bayes' rule, called uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule, to technically realize the above philosophy, thus combating the model uncertainties in prior and/or data distributions. Applications of the uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule on classification and estimation are discussed: In particular, the uncertainty-aware Bayes classifier, the uncertainty-aware Kalman filter, the uncertainty-aware particle filter, and the uncertainty-aware interactive-multiple-model filter are suggested and experimentally validated.

Title: Stabilization of Predator-Prey Age-Structured Hyperbolic PDE when Harvesting both Species is Inevitable
Authors: Carina Veil, Miroslav Krstić, Iasson Karafyllis, Mamadou Diagne, Oliver Sawodny
Abstract: Populations do not only interact over time but also age over time. It is therefore common to model them as age-structured PDEs, where age is the space variable. Since the models also involve integrals over age, both in the birth process and in the interaction among species, they are in fact integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs) with positive states. To regulate the population densities to desired profiles, harvesting is used as input. But non-discriminating harvesting, where wanting to repress one species will inevitably repress the other species as well, the positivity restriction on the input (no insertion of population), and the multiplicative nature of harvesting, makes control challenging even for ODE versions of such dynamics, let alone for their IPDE versions on an infinite-dimensional nonnegative state space. We introduce a design for a benchmark version of such a problem: a two-population predator-prey setup. The model is equivalent to two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), actuated by harvesting which must not drop below zero, and strongly disturbed by two autonomous but exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs). We develop two control designs. With a modified Volterra-like control Lyapunov function, we design a simple feedback which employs possibly negative harvesting for global stabilization of the ODE model, while guaranteeing regional regulation with positive harvesting. With a more sophisticated, restrained controller we achieve regulation for the ODE model globally, with positive harvesting. For the full IPDE model, with the IDE dynamics acting as large disturbances, for both the simple and saturated feedback laws we provide explicit estimates of the regions of attraction. The paper charts a new pathway for control designs for infinite-dimensional multi-species dynamics and for nonlinear positive systems with positive controls.

Title: Towards Practical Deep Schedulers for Allocating Cellular Radio Resources
Authors: Petteri Kela, Bryan Liu, Alvaro Valcarce
Abstract: Machine learning methods are often suggested to address wireless network functions, such as radio packet scheduling. However, a feasible 3GPP-compliant scheduler capable of delivering fair throughput across users, while keeping a low computational complexity for 5G and beyond is still missing. To address this, we first take a critical look at previous deep scheduler efforts. Secondly, we enhance State-of-the-Art (SoTA) deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and adapt them to train our deep scheduler. In particular, we propose novel training techniques for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a new Distributional Soft Actor-Critic Discrete (DSACD) algorithm, which outperformed other tested variants. These improvements were achieved while maintaining minimal actor network complexity, making them suitable for real-time computing environments. Additionally, the entropy learning in SACD was fine-tuned to accommodate resource allocation action spaces of varying sizes. Our proposed deep schedulers exhibited strong generalization across different bandwidths, number of MU-MIMO layers, and traffic models. Ultimately, we show that our pre-trained deep schedulers outperform their heuristic rivals in realistic and standard-compliant 5G system-level simulations.

Title: AC-Informed DC Optimal Transmission Switching Problems via Parameter Optimization
Authors: Babak Taheri, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problems minimize operational costs while treating both the transmission line energization statuses and generator setpoints as decision variables. The combination of nonlinearities from an AC power flow model and discrete variables associated with line statuses makes AC-OTS a computationally challenging Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). To address these challenges, the DC power flow approximation is often used to obtain a DC-OTS formulation expressed as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). However, this approximation often leads to suboptimal or infeasible switching decisions when evaluated with an AC power flow model. This paper proposes an enhanced DC-OTS formulation that leverages techniques for training machine learning models to optimize the DC power flow model's parameters. By optimally selecting parameter values that align flows in the DC power flow model with apparent power flows -- incorporating both real and reactive components -- from AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions, our method more accurately captures line congestion behavior. Integrating these optimized parameters into the DC-OTS formulation significantly improves the accuracy of switching decisions and reduces discrepancies between DC-OTS and AC-OTS solutions. We compare our optimized DC-OTS model against traditional OTS approaches, including DC-OTS, Linear Programming AC (LPAC)-OTS, and Quadratic Convex (QC)-OTS. Numerical results show that switching decisions from our model yield better performance when evaluated using an AC power flow model, with up to $44\%$ cost reductions in some cases.

Title: Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid
Authors: Jöbke Janssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bert Zwart, Jalal Kazempour
Abstract: One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) optimization algorithms, which utilize channel estimation methods, in ray tracing (RT) simulations within urban digital twin environments. Beyond Sionna's native capabilities, we implement and benchmark additional RIS optimization algorithms based on channel estimation, enabling an evaluation of RIS strategies under various deployment conditions. Coverage maps for RIS-assisted communication systems are generated through the integration of Sionna's RT simulations. Moreover, real-world experimentation underscores the necessity of validating algorithms in near-realistic simulation environments, as minor variations in measurement setups can significantly affect performance.

Title: Hybrid Fingerprint-based Positioning in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Manish Kumar, Tzu-Hsuan Chou, Byunghyun Lee, Nicolo Michelusi, David J. Love, James V. Krogmeier
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in 6G technology for integrated sensing and communications, where positioning stands out as a key application. In the realm of 6G, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, featuring distributed base stations equipped with a large number of antennas, present an abundant source of angle-of-arrival (AOA) information that could be exploited for positioning applications. In this paper we leverage this AOA information at the base stations using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, in conjunction with received signal strength (RSS) for positioning through Gaussian process regression (GPR). An AOA fingerprint database is constructed by capturing the angle data from multiple locations across the network area and is combined with RSS data from the same locations to form a hybrid fingerprint which is then used to train a GPR model employing a squared exponential kernel. The trained regression model is subsequently utilized to estimate the location of a user equipment. Simulations demonstrate that the GPR model with hybrid input achieves better positioning accuracy than traditional GPR models utilizing RSS-only and AOA-only inputs.

Title: End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control
Authors: Xiaole Zhang, Peiyu Zhang, Xiongye Xiao, Shixuan Li, Vasileios Tzoumas, Vijay Gupta, Paul Bogdan
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.

Title: RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior
Authors: Ching-Hua Lee, Chouchang Yang, Jaejin Cho, Yashas Malur Saidutta, Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized for recovering a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.

Title: Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling
Authors: Simon Malacek, José Portela, Yannick Marcus Werner, Sonja Wogrin
Abstract: Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.

Title: Transfer Learning for LQR Control
Authors: Taosha Guo, Fabio Pasqualetti
Abstract: In this paper, we study a transfer learning framework for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control, where (i) the dynamics of the system of interest (target system) are unknown and only a short trajectory of impulse responses from the target system is provided, and (ii) impulse responses are available from $N$ source systems with different dynamics. We show that the LQR controller can be learned from a sufficiently long trajectory of impulse responses. Further, a transferable mode set can be identified using the available data from source systems and the target system, enabling the reconstruction of the target system's impulse responses for controller design. By leveraging data from source systems, we show that the sample complexity for synthesizing the LQR controller can be reduced by $50 \%$. Algorithms and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed transfer control framework.

Title: Learning-Based MPC for Fuel Efficient Control of Autonomous Vehicles with Discrete Gear Selection
Authors: Samuel Mallick, Gianpietro Battocletti, Qizhang Dong, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: Co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position via model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to offer benefits for fuel-efficient autonomous driving. However, optimizing both the vehicle's continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions may be too computationally intensive for a real-time implementation. This work proposes a learning-based MPC scheme to address this issue. A policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction horizon of the MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved online. In simulation, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.

Title: Synthesizing Grid Data with Cyber Resilience and Privacy Guarantees
Authors: Shengyang Wu, Vladimir Dvorkin
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides a principled approach to synthesizing data (e.g., loads) from real-world power systems while limiting the exposure of sensitive information. However, adversaries may exploit synthetic data to calibrate cyberattacks on the source grids. To control these risks, we propose new DP algorithms for synthesizing data that provide the source grids with both cyber resilience and privacy guarantees. The algorithms incorporate both normal operation and attack optimization models to balance the fidelity of synthesized data and cyber resilience. The resulting post-processing optimization is reformulated as a robust optimization problem, which is compatible with the exponential mechanism of DP to moderate its computational burden.

Title: WaveNet-Volterra Neural Networks for Active Noise Control: A Fully Causal Approach
Authors: Lu Bai, Mengtong Li, Siyuan Lian, Kai Chen, Jing Lu
Abstract: Active Noise Control (ANC) systems are challenged by nonlinear distortions, which degrade the performance of traditional adaptive filters. While deep learning-based ANC algorithms have emerged to address nonlinearity, existing approaches often overlook critical limitations: (1) end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) models frequently violate causality constraints inherent to real-time ANC applications; (2) many studies compare DNN-based methods against simplified or low-order adaptive filters rather than fully optimized high-order counterparts. In this letter, we propose a causality-preserving time-domain ANC framework that synergizes WaveNet with Volterra Neural Networks (VNNs), explicitly addressing system nonlinearity while ensuring strict causal operation. Unlike prior DNN-based approaches, our method is benchmarked against both state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and rigorously optimized high-order adaptive filters, including Wiener solutions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing DNN methods and traditional algorithms, revealing that prior claims of DNN superiority stem from incomplete comparisons with suboptimal traditional baselines.

Title: Online Model Order Reduction of Linear Systems via $(γ,δ)$-Similarity
Authors: Shivam Bajaj, Carolyn L. Beck, Vijay Gupta
Abstract: Model order reduction aims to determine a low-order approximation of high-order models with least possible approximation errors. For application to physical systems, it is crucial that the reduced order model (ROM) is robust to any disturbance that acts on the full order model (FOM) -- in the sense that the output of the ROM remains a good approximation of that of the FOM, even in the presence of such disturbances. In this work, we present a framework for online model order reduction for a class of continuous-time linear systems that ensures this property for any $\mathcal{L}_2$ disturbance. Apart from robustness to disturbances in this sense, the proposed framework also displays other desirable properties for model order reduction: (1) a provable bound on the error defined as the $L_2$ norm of the difference between the output of the ROM and FOM, (2) preservation of stability, (3) compositionality properties and a provable error bound for arbitrary interconnected systems, (4) a provable bound on the output of the FOM when the controller designed for the ROM is used with the FOM, and finally, (5) compatibility with existing approaches such as balanced truncation and moment matching. Property (4) does not require computation of any gap metric and property (5) is beneficial as existing approaches can also be equipped with some of the preceding properties. The theoretical results are corroborated on numerical case studies, including on a building model.

Authors: Sonia Foschiatti, Axel Kittenberger, Otmar Scherzer
Abstract: The recovery of severely damaged ancient written documents has proven to be a major challenge for many scientists, mainly due to the impracticality of physical unwrapping them. Non-destructive techniques, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT), combined with computer vision algorithms, have emerged as a means of facilitating the virtual reading of the hidden contents of the damaged documents. This paper proposes an educational laboratory aimed at simulating the entire process of acquisition and virtual recovery of the ancient works. We have developed an experimental setup that uses visible light to replace the detrimental X-rays, and a didactic software pipeline that allows students to virtually reconstruct a transparent rolled sheet with printed text on it, the wrapped scroll.

Title: Towards Flow-Matching-based TTS without Classifier-Free Guidance
Authors: Yuzhe Liang, Wenzhe Liu, Chunyu Qiang, Zhikang Niu, Yushen Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Nan Li, Chen Zhang, Xie Chen
Abstract: Flow matching has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and has become a core component in modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. To ensure high-quality speech synthesis, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used during the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. However, CFG incurs substantial computational cost as it requires two forward passes, which hinders its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we explore removing CFG from flow-matching-based TTS models to improve inference efficiency, while maintaining performance. Specifically, we reformulated the flow matching training target to directly approximate the CFG optimization trajectory. This training method eliminates the need for unconditional model evaluation and guided tuning during inference, effectively cutting the computational overhead in half. Furthermore, It can be seamlessly integrated with existing optimized sampling strategies. We validate our approach using the F5-TTS model on the LibriTTS dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 9$\times$ inference speed-up compared to the baseline F5-TTS, while preserving comparable speech quality. We will release the code and models to support reproducibility and foster further research in this area.

Title: Smart Environmental Monitoring of Marine Pollution using Edge AI
Authors: Mohamed Moursi, Norbert Wehn, Bilal Hammoud
Abstract: Oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems and coastal environments, necessitating rapid detection and monitoring capabilities to mitigate environmental damage. In this paper, we demonstrate how artificial intelligence, despite the inherent high computational and memory requirements, can be efficiently integrated into marine pollution monitoring systems. More precisely, we propose a drone-based smart monitoring system leveraging a compressed deep learning U-Net architecture for oil spill detection and thickness estimation. Compared to the standard U-Net architecture, the number of convolution blocks and channels per block are modified. The new model is then trained on synthetic radar data to accurately predict thick oil slick thickness up to 10 mm. Results show that our optimized Tiny U-Net achieves superior performance with an Intersection over Union (IoU) metric of approximately 79%, while simultaneously reducing the model size by a factor of $\sim$269x compared to the state-of-the-art. This significant model compression enables efficient edge computing deployment on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware integrated directly into the drone platform. Hardware implementation demonstrates near real-time thickness estimation capabilities with a run-time power consumption of approximately 2.2 watts. Our findings highlight the increasing potential of smart monitoring technologies and efficient edge computing for operational characterization in marine environments.

Title: Recursive Algorithms for Sparse Parameter Identification of Multivariate Stochastic Systems with Non-stationary Observations
Authors: Yanxin Fu, Wenxiao Zhao
Abstract: The classical sparse parameter identification methods are usually based on the iterative basis selection such as greedy algorithms, or the numerical optimization of regularized cost functions such as LASSO and Bayesian posterior probability distribution, etc., which, however, are not suitable for online sparsity inference when data arrive sequentially. This paper presents recursive algorithms for sparse parameter identification of multivariate stochastic systems with non-stationary observations. First, a new bivariate criterion function is presented by introducing an auxiliary variable matrix into a weighted $L_1$ regularization criterion. The new criterion function is subsequently decomposed into two solvable subproblems via alternating optimization of the two variable matrices, for which the optimizers can be explicitly formulated into recursive equations. Second, under the non-stationary and non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems, theoretical properties of the recursive algorithms are established. That is, the estimates are proved to be with (i) set convergence, i.e., the accurate estimation of the sparse index set of the unknown parameter matrix, and (ii) parameter convergence, i.e., the consistent estimation for values of the non-zero elements of the unknown parameter matrix. Finally, numerical examples are given to support the theoretical analysis.

Title: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multiuser Downlink Beamforming in the Wave Domain
Authors: Jiancheng An, Marco Di Renzo, Mérouane Debbah, H. Vincent Poor, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Intelligent metasurface has recently emerged as a promising technology that enables the customization of wireless environments by harnessing large numbers of low-cost reconfigurable scattering elements. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on single-layer metasurfaces, which have limitations in terms of wave-domain processing capabilities due to practical hardware limitations. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) design. Specifically, we investigate the integration of SIM into the downlink of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system, where an SIM, consisting of a multilayer metasurface structure, is deployed at the base station (BS) to facilitate transmit beamforming in the electromagnetic wave domain. This eliminates the need for conventional digital beamforming and high-resolution digital-to-analog converters at the BS. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of all user equipments by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM, subject to constraints on the transmit power budget and discrete phase shifts. Furthermore, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for solving the formulated joint optimization problem and elaborate on the potential benefits of employing SIM in wireless networks. Numerical results are illustrated to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design and to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm compared to various benchmark schemes. It is demonstrated that considering the same number of transmit antennas, the proposed SIM-based system achieves about 200\% improvement in terms of sum rate compared to conventional MISO systems.

Title: P-Hologen: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Phase-Only Holograms
Authors: JooHyun Park, YuJin Jeon, HuiYong Kim, SeungHwan Baek, HyeongYeop Kang
Abstract: Holography stands at the forefront of visual technology, offering immersive, three-dimensional visualizations through the manipulation of light wave amplitude and phase. Although generative models have been extensively explored in the image domain, their application to holograms remains relatively underexplored due to the inherent complexity of phase learning. Exploiting generative models for holograms offers exciting opportunities for advancing innovation and creativity, such as semantic-aware hologram generation and editing. Currently, the most viable approach for utilizing generative models in the hologram domain involves integrating an image-based generative model with an image-to-hologram conversion model, which comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and inefficiency. To tackle this problem, we introduce P-Hologen, the first end-to-end generative framework designed for phase-only holograms (POHs). P-Hologen employs vector quantized variational autoencoders to capture the complex distributions of POHs. It also integrates the angular spectrum method into the training process, constructing latent spaces for complex phase data using strategies from the image processing domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that P-Hologen achieves superior quality and computational efficiency compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, our model generates high-quality unseen, diverse holographic content from its learned latent space without requiring pre-existing images. Our work paves the way for new applications and methodologies in holographic content creation, opening a new era in the exploration of generative holographic content. The code for our paper is publicly available on this https URL.

Title: Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems
Authors: Fredrik Hagström, Vikas Garg, Fabricio Oliveira
Abstract: Buildings account for 40% of global energy consumption. A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. In this paper, we demonstrate that using federated learning to train the reinforcement learning controller of HVAC systems can improve the learning speed, as well as improve their ability to generalize, which in turn facilitates transfer learning to unseen building environments. In our setting, a global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. We perform experiments evaluating three different optimizers for local policy training, as well as three different federated learning algorithms against two alternative baselines. Our experiments show that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy. Furthermore, the learning stability is significantly improved, with the learning process and performance of the federated policy being less sensitive to the choice of parameters and the inherent randomness of reinforcement learning.

Authors: Hao Liu, Jiancheng An, Xing Jia, Lu Gan, George K. Karagiannidis, Bruno Clerckx, Mehdi Bennis, Mérouane Debbah, Tie Jun Cui
Abstract: The rapid growth of wireless communications has created a significant demand for high throughput, seamless connectivity, and extremely low latency. To meet these goals, a novel technology -- stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) -- has been developed to perform signal processing by directly utilizing electromagnetic waves, thus achieving incredibly fast computing speed while reducing hardware requirements. In this article, we provide an overview of SIM technology, including its underlying hardware, benefits, and exciting applications in wireless communications. Specifically, we examine the utilization of SIMs in realizing transmit beamforming and semantic encoding in the wave domain. Additionally, channel estimation in SIM-aided communication systems is discussed. Finally, we highlight potential research opportunities and identify key challenges for deploying SIMs in wireless networks to motivate future research.

Title: Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping
Authors: Qian Dan, Hongjiang Lei, Ki-Hong Park, Gaofeng Pan, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{é}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Title: REFFLY: Melody-Constrained Lyrics Editing Model
Authors: Songyan Zhao, Bingxuan Li, Yufei Tian, Nanyun Peng
Abstract: Automatic melody-to-lyric (M2L) generation aims to create lyrics that align with a given melody. While most previous approaches generate lyrics from scratch, revision, editing plain text draft to fit it into the melody, offers a much more flexible and practical alternative. This enables broad applications, such as generating lyrics from flexible inputs (keywords, themes, or full text that needs refining to be singable), song translation (preserving meaning across languages while keeping the melody intact), or style transfer (adapting lyrics to different genres). This paper introduces REFFLY (REvision Framework For LYrics), the first revision framework for editing and generating melody-aligned lyrics. We train the lyric revision module using our curated synthesized melody-aligned lyrics dataset, enabling it to transform plain text into lyrics that align with a given melody. To further enhance the revision ability, we propose training-free heuristics aimed at preserving both semantic meaning and musical consistency throughout the editing process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of REFFLY across various tasks (e.g. lyrics generation, song translation), showing that our model outperforms strong baselines, including Lyra (Tian et al., 2023) and GPT-4, by 25% in both musicality and text quality.

Title: Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems
Authors: Jake Welde, Nishanth Rao, Pratik Kunapuli, Dinesh Jayaraman, Vijay Kumar
Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.

Title: Exploring the Computational Feasibility of Direct Pseudoinversion of the Encoding Matrix for MR Image Reconstruction (Pinv-Recon)
Authors: Kylie Yeung, Christine Tobler, Rolf F Schulte, Benjamin White, Anthony McIntyre, Sebastien Serres, Peter Morris, Dorothee Auer, Fergus V Gleeson, Damian J Tyler, James T Grist, Florian Wiesinger
Abstract: Image reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fundamentally a linear inverse problem, such that the image can be recovered via explicit pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix by solving $\textbf{data} = \textbf{Encode} \times \textbf{image}$ - a method referred to here as Pinv-Recon. While the benefits of this approach were acknowledged in early studies, the field has historically favored fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and iterative techniques due to perceived computational limitations of the pseudoinversion approach. This work revisits Pinv-Recon in the context of modern hardware, software, and optimized linear algebra routines. We compare various matrix inversion strategies, assess regularization effects, and demonstrate incorporation of advanced encoding physics into a unified reconstruction framework. While hardware advances have already significantly reduced computation time compared to earlier studies, our work further demonstrates that leveraging Cholesky decomposition and block-wise inversion leads to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over previous Singular Value Decomposition-based implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of Pinv-Recon on diverse \textit{in vivo} datasets encompassing a range of encoding schemes, starting with low- to medium-resolution functional and metabolic imaging and extending to high-resolution cases. Our findings establish Pinv-Recon as a practical and adaptable reconstruction method that aligns with the increasing emphasis on open-source and reproducible MRI research.

Title: Convex Data-Driven Contraction With Riemannian Metrics
Authors: Andreas Oliveira, Jian Zheng, Mario Sznaier
Abstract: The growing complexity of dynamical systems and advances in data collection necessitates robust data-driven control strategies without explicit system identification and robust synthesis. Data-driven stability has been explored in linear and nonlinear systems, often by turning the problem into a linear or positive semidefinite program. This paper focuses on a new emerging property called contractivity, which refers to the exponential convergence of all system trajectories toward each other under a specified metric. Data-driven closed loop contractivity has been studied for the case of the 2-norm and assuming nonlinearities are Lipschitz bounded in subsets of n dimensional euclidean space. We extend the analysis by considering Riemannian metrics for polynomial dynamics. The key to our derivation is to leverage the convex criteria for closed-loop contraction and duality results to efficiently check infinite dimensional membership constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both linear and nonlinear systems, highlighting its potential for robust data-driven contraction.

Title: Design and Implementation of a Dual Uncrewed Surface Vessel Platform for Bathymetry Research under High-flow Conditions
Authors: Dinesh Kumar, Amin Ghorbanpour, Kin Yen, Iman Soltani
Abstract: Bathymetry, the study of underwater topography, relies on sonar mapping of submerged structures. These measurements, critical for infrastructure health monitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk associated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat bathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently fail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection, especially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance autonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a particular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware platforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused autonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing. This paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two complementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research. This includes a low-cost USV for Navigation And Control research (NAC-USV) and a second, high-end USV equipped with a high-resolution multi-beam sonar and the associated hardware for Bathymetry data quality Evaluation and Post-processing research (BEP-USV). The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous, fail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for high-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment. The BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional control validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and post-processing methodologies. We detail the design and implementation of both systems, and open source the design. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in a range of operational scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient material logistics play a critical role in controlling costs and schedules in the construction industry. However, manual material handling remains prone to inefficiencies, delays, and safety risks. Autonomous forklifts offer a promising solution to streamline on-site logistics, reducing reliance on human operators and mitigating labor shortages. This paper presents the development and evaluation of ADAPT (Autonomous Dynamic All-terrain Pallet Transporter), a fully autonomous off-road forklift designed for construction environments. Unlike structured warehouse settings, construction sites pose significant challenges, including dynamic obstacles, unstructured terrain, and varying weather conditions. To address these challenges, our system integrates AI-driven perception techniques with traditional approaches for decision making, planning, and control, enabling reliable operation in complex environments. We validate the system through extensive real-world testing, comparing its continuous performance against an experienced human operator across various weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous outdoor forklifts can operate near human-level performance, offering a viable path toward safer and more efficient construction logistics.

Title: Reflections on Diversity: A Real-time Virtual Mirror for Inclusive 3D Face Transformations
Authors: Paraskevi Valergaki, Antonis Argyros, Giorgos Giannakakis, Anastasios Roussos
Abstract: Real-time 3D face manipulation has significant applications in virtual reality, social media and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces a novel system, which we call Mirror of Diversity (MOD), that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture manipulation and 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) for facial geometry to achieve realistic face transformations that reflect various demographic characteristics, emphasizing the beauty of diversity and the universality of human features. As participants sit in front of a computer monitor with a camera positioned above, their facial characteristics are captured in real time and can further alter their digital face reconstruction with transformations reflecting different demographic characteristics, such as gender and ethnicity (e.g., a person from Africa, Asia, Europe). Another feature of our system, which we call Collective Face, generates an averaged face representation from multiple participants' facial data. A comprehensive evaluation protocol is implemented to assess the realism and demographic accuracy of the transformations. Qualitative feedback is gathered through participant questionnaires, which include comparisons of MOD transformations with similar filters on platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. Additionally, quantitative analysis is conducted using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network that predicts gender and ethnicity, to validate the accuracy of demographic transformations.

Title: Asynchronous Push-sum Dual Gradient Algorithm in Distributed Model Predictive Control
Authors: Pengbiao Wang, Xuemei Ren, Dongdong Zheng
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for distributed discrete-time linear systems with both local and global constraints over directed communication networks. We establish an optimization problem to formulate the DMPC policy, including the design of terminal ingredients. To cope with the global constraint, we transform the primal optimization problem into its dual problem. Then, we propose a novel asynchronous push-sum dual gradient (APDG) algorithm with an adaptive step-size scheme to solve this dual problem in a fully asynchronous distributed manner. The proposed algorithm does not require synchronous waiting and any form of coordination, which greatly improves solving efficiency. We theoretically prove that the APDG algorithm converges at an R-linear rate as long as the step-size does not exceed the designed upper bound. Furthermore, we develop a distributed termination criterion to terminate the APDG algorithm when its output solution satisfies the specified suboptimality and the global constraint, thereby avoiding an infinite number of iterations. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop system are also established. Finally, a numerical example clarifies and validates theoretical findings.

Title: Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification
Authors: Fuma Ito, Chihiro Tsutake, Keita Takahashi, Toshiaki Fujii
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.

Title: AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and Insights
Authors: Tzu-Hao Huang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shang-Ho Tsai, Trung Q. Duong
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.
